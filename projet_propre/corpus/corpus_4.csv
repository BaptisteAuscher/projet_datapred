Still, following a pandemic that changed the landscape for many economic sectors, the hybrid shopping model has become table stakes.

Rick West, CEO of Field Agent, a research and retail data collection firm in Fayetteville, said omnichannel retail is here to stay, and retailers have to make room for omnichannel and the hybrid shopping experience because customers expect it.

""Specifically, from the retailer perspective, the omnichannel experience will shift again in 2024,"" West said.

He said shoppers want every option and to be served efficiently whether shopping online, in physical stores or some combination of both. He said that in 2022 and 2023, many top retailers moved their staff from front checkout lanes to accommodate online pickup and delivery. West said retailers saw that as temporary, and many still needed to change their backrooms.

""And now, based on the work we're seeing at Field Agent, many retailers are coming to the conclusion that the hybrid shopping experience is not going to go away,"" West said.

He said shoppers expect stellar customer service and short wait times in line while shopping in stores, and they also want quick pickup service and convenient delivery options. West believes retailers who have yet to make structural changes to backroom staffing will do so this year, impacting labor and staffing shortages. He said customer experience will also be affected as more retailers move to self-check while reallocating employees to pickup and delivery.

He said that increasing minimum wage rates means the fast food industry is moving to kiosk ordering and payment, eliminating the need for designated cashiers. McDonald's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread have embraced this move. West said that while it can be frustrating for the customer who only wants to order a soft drink, this is how the industry moves.

Even small retail stores like Dollar General and Walmart convenience stores offer self-check options and a smaller human staff.

West said retailers can't fight how consumers want to shop and must meet the shoppers where they are. He said shoppers now play a more significant role in the retail experience as they check out and bag their purchases.

""We will start to notice in local Walmarts, Targets and Costcos an upgrade in technology to make way for a faster, easier, more reliable self-checkout experience,"" West said. ""One thing that retailers have not yet found is a perfect solution for the impact of theft at each self-checkout station. What will be the impact on the overall shopping experience, and will prices also start to reflect the impact of theft at retail.""

West said there may be no real solutions, only trade-offs for the most complex problems. He said shoppers will likely have longer waits, higher prices and still have to do more of the labor on their shopping trips in exchange for the convenience of pickup, delivery and online shopping.

Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. reports that while offering a compelling omnichannel experience used to be the bleeding edge of retail, it is now a requirement for survival. McKinsey reports that 63% of consumers expect omnichannel purchases to continue. McKinsey also warns that retailers must embrace omnichannel and try to find a way to pay for it. McKinsey said retailers must prioritize one business that serves customers in stores and online.

McKinsey spotlighted three models that retailers are tackling omnichannel. The models include a traditional commerce option focusing on personalization and an ecosystem model. McKinsey said retailers must decide which model provides the best chance to drive long-term value.

""At the most basic level, the commerce option allows retailers to meet the minimum threshold for omnichannel performance. However, retailers with more advanced capabilities can take it to a different level. Best Buy, for instance, has burnished the in-store experience with curated offerings that allow customers to explore smart-home technology solutions, which they pair with free in-home advisory services,"" McKinsey noted.

The Best Buy mobile app also allows customers to scan to shop from catalogs and curbside and offers the ability to buy online, pick up in-store and quickly add tech support service.

Walmart has also invested in its omnichannel offering with connected stores, AI-driven smart search online and numerous backend updates such as more fulfillment from stores that helped improve profitability by lowering e-commerce losses by 40% in the recent quarter. Walmart also shaved 20% of last-mile delivery costs using more in-store fulfillment.

McKinsey said retailers must also evoke personalization to improve consumer engagement across shopping modes. McKinsey highlights beauty specialty retailer Sephora's ability to message customers with push notifications and book in-person beauty consultations with their phones.

Sephora store technology allows employees to access a customer's favorite items and suggest new products that align with their profile. Customers can use scanners to match products to their hair color and skin type. Sephora's loyalty program taps unified customer data and links offers across email, web, and mobile to drive online and in-store purchases. By achieving this level of personalization, Sephora can capture greater value from its rich customer data. Sephora reports that customers who visit the retailer's website within 24 hours of entering the store are three times more likely to purchase at an average of 13% higher than other customers.

McKinsey said another way retailers can delve into omnichannel is to build or join an ecosystem that allows customers to participate in community-based interactions that are extensions of the brand. McKinsey highlights Nike, which uses Run Club apps to foster in-person meet-ups, running groups and events for customers. Nike also offers a training club app that delivers individual workouts and multiweek fitness programs.

McKinsey said Nike's investments in the ecosystem model allow the brand to create experiences far beyond their show and apparel lines to fold the brand into an individual's day-to-day routines.",talkbusiness.net,news,Talk Business & Politics,Kim Souza,0.05882352941176472,448987159,1,https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/webhed_SupplySide-Firebend.jpg,

OpenAI is contacting Hollywood studios and executives to explore potential applications of its new AI video generation tool, Sora.

Sora is currently unreleased but has garnered attention for its ability to create realistic video clips that are up to one minute long, which could take an hour to generate, based on text descriptions. OpenAI recently held introductory meetings in Hollywood to show Sora's capabilities to industry leaders.

OpenAI's outreach also comes as media companies grapple with the implications of AI training on copyrighted material. Discussions regarding licensing agreements between OpenAI and outlets like CNN and Fox Corp. have reportedly taken place.

The company faces competition in the text-to-video AI space. Companies like Google and Meta have showcased similar research projects. Additionally, startups like Runway AI are already experiencing professional adoption of their text-to-video tools in pre-production workflows. OpenAI CTO says Sora ""could be a few months"" away from public launch.

Earlier, Microsoft announced that Sora would come to Copilot. This news comes after a user tweeted asking if Sora would be coming to Copilot, to which Parakhin responded, ""Eventually, but it will take time.""

(Resident is the company behind Nectar and DreamCloud - two of the best mattress brands around.) It's available as a hybrid or all-foam bed and comes with three firmness levels: Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, or Firm).

For one month, I slept on a twin Cloverlane Hybrid Mattress in Plush Soft, which is deemed the best level of firmness for pressure relief. In addition to my experience, I asked four volunteers to nap on it as well and conducted a series of objective tests. My full Cloverlane Mattress review is below but if you're short on time, here's the abridged version...

The Cloverlane either has a bed of 8-inch wrapped coils surrounded by dense foam (hybrid) or a 9-inch foam core (memory foam). The core of the Cloverlane Mattress influences its level of firmness. Both versions of the Cloverlane Mattress have multiple foam layers, a latex lumbar support strip, and a polyester-blend cover.

My fellow testers and I found the Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid most suitable for side sleeping, but it has a firmer-than-advertised feel. You'll need to give it at least a month before you start to feel more settled into it - and even then, it may still feel firm. Fortunately, you get 365 nights to break this mattress in.

The Cloverlane's lumbar support system - a half-inch thick strip of latex and specialized quilting in the center of the bed - kept me from waking up with stiffness in my lower back. There's all-over pressure relief with the Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid, which increases the more you sleep on it.

My drop tests showed that the Cloverlane Hybrid has above-average motion isolation. That result is likely to be even better with the Cloverlane Memory Foam Mattress. However, the hybrid should sleep cooler than the foam version since it has springs to increase airflow along with the breathable cover and 16 brass air vents. (I didn't overheat with my Cloverlane Hybrid at all.)

Edge support, however, was hit-or-miss on my twin test unit. I found the Cloverlane Hybrid supportive enough to keep me from rolling off the bed when I rolled too close to the edges, but some of my testers didn't feel as steady when sitting along the middle perimeter. This could be a different story on larger versions of the bed, but I believe sturdy edges should be a feature of any mattress, regardless of size.

Does the Cloverlane Hybrid do enough to overtake the Saatva Classic as TechRadar's #1 mattress? I don't think so. The Cloverlane is a comfortable bed but it's not meticulously hand-crafted like the Saatva. (The Cloverlane still comes in a box, despite arriving flat.) The polyester-blend cover doesn't feel as luxe as the organic cotton cover that kept our reviewer comfortably cool in our Saatva Classic mattress review.

The Cloverlane Mattress is always on sale for up to $700 off - a queen-size goes for $1,499 in either hybrid or memory foam. (This is interesting to point out because hybrid mattresses generally cost more than their foam-only counterparts.) It comes with White Glove Delivery plus optional mattress disposal, a one-year risk-free trial, and a lifetime warranty.

The Cloverlane comes in one height (15 inches), two builds (hybrid and memory foam), and three firmness levels (Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, and Firm). The Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid is what's being reviewed here.

The bottom half of the mattress either has 8-inch wrapped coils surrounded by a dense foam wall for edge support or a 9-inch foam core instead. The core of the mattress influences the level of firmness. On top are 2.5 inches of transitional support foam plus 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam. In between those layers is a half-inch thick strip of latex that runs across the center of the mattress for lumbar support.

The Cloverlane Mattress has a Euro-top: 1.75 inches of plush foam wrapped in a blend of polyester, cotton, and polyethylene. Specialty quilting in the middle third complements the latex lumbar layer.

All of the foams in the Cloverlane Mattress are CertiPUR-US certified, meaning they've been tested for harmful chemicals and the VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions that result in off-gassing odors. (I didn't detect any obvious smell from my Cloverlane Hybrid mattress.) It's unclear whether the Cloverlane Mattresses have fiberglass.

The poly-blend cover isn't uncomfortable, but compared to a luxury mattress with a tufted organic cotton cover (Saatva Classic) or a soft cashmere-blend cover (DreamCloud), the Cloverlane appears less shiny. However, the side-carry handles are a convenient touch, and the 16 brass air vents are a good way to boost airflow.

The Cloverlane Mattress has been on sale for up to $700 off from the time it launched late last year. Like most Resident brands, you can ignore the MSRPs. A queen Cloverlane mattress sells for $1,499, which is right on the border between TechRadar's upper mid-range and premium pricing brackets. Prices are the same for the all-foam version of the Cloverlane.

Here is the official sale pricing for the Cloverlane Mattress, at time of writing:

Add-ons include a specialty cooling cover with extra heat-wicking fibers for $199 and a discounted bedding bundle with down pillows, percale sheets, and a mattress pad from $199 (up to a $696 value).

Compared to the Saatva Classic, you're paying about $200 to $400 less, depending on the type of Saatva mattress sale running at the moment. That's not a significant differential. Cloverlane and Saatva both offer a one-year trial, a lifetime warranty, and free White Glove Delivery with optional mattress removal. (Saatva also adds foundation removal.) Cloverlane offers free returns, while Saatva charges a $99 fee.

Among the broader luxury mattress market, Cloverlane's extras make it an excellent value for money. Side-by-side with the Saatva Classic, however, the difference is negligible. If you have the money to spare, I'd recommend just going for the luxe, handcrafted Saatva and its free mattress and foundation removal. Otherwise, the Cloverlane is a sound choice if you want to spend a few hundred dollars less.

The Cloverlane Mattress comes in three firmness levels (based on a 10-point firmness scale):

For the first half of my month-long testing period, my Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid Mattress felt decidedly firm. I double-checked the mattress tag and my order details to make sure I knew what I was sleeping on. However, by the fourth and final week, I noticed more give around my shoulders and hips. It still wasn't supremely plush - and I definitely wouldn't rate it a 4 out of 10 on the firmness scale - but it's slightly softer than when I first laid on it.

I'm not the only one who noticed this, either. One of my lightweight volunteers tried my Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid Mattress twice. During her initial trial in week two, she rated it a 10 out of 10 on the firmness scale, but when she tried it again during week four, she knocked that down to a 9 and said she felt more settled. You'll need to make the most of your year-long trial because the Cloverlane may take quite a while to fully break in.

But is the Cloverlane Mattress comfortable otherwise? My fellow testers and I think so. I rate the Plush Soft Hybrid I tested the best for side sleeping for its pressure relief from the top foam layers. I was also comfortable stomach sleeping, particularly during the first couple of weeks when it was much firmer. If you strictly sleep on your stomach, though, choose the Cloverlane Firm.

Most of the back sleepers in my group liked the Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid Mattress but you'll want to go for the Luxury Firm version for the best balance of support and relief. One of my older back sleepers with arthritis, who tried my Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid during week three, said she would have liked more lumbar support.

To objectively test the Cloverlane Hybrid's pressure relief, I placed a 50lb weight at the center of the mattress, where it sank about three inches. That seems on-brand for a Plush Soft hybrid mattress. Moving the weight towards the bottom half of the mattress yielded a similar level of sinkage.

Is the Cloverlane a good mattress for back pain? After transitioning from the Saatva RX - which is one of the best mattresses for back pain I've ever slept on - I think the Cloverlane's latex lumbar strip and specialty quilting do a good job of picking up where the Saatva left off for me. I didn't wake up with any stiffness or pain in my lower lumbar at any point during testing. By the way - the Cloverlane Hybrid is endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association.

For one month, I slept on a slept on a twin Cloverlane Hybrid mattress in Plush Soft and asked four adult volunteers of varying body types and sleep preferences to nap on it for at least 15 minutes to help provide a broader perspective. I also tested its temperature regulation, motion isolation, and edge support. Here's what I found...

I tested the Cloverlane Hybrid between December 2023 and January 2024, so I endured plenty of frigid nights. Of course, I kept the heat running (around 72 degrees F) and layered up with a polyester blanket and a mid-weight polyester comforter atop my 100% cotton sheets.

The Cloverlane Hybrid did a good job of maintaining temperature-neutral sleep throughout the month I slept on it. I wouldn't say it's profoundly cooling but I'm willing to bet it's more breathable than the all-foam Cloverlane Mattress. (It's a hybrid, after all.) If you deal with regular night sweats, you can add a specialty cover with extra heat-wicking material for $199 more.

Still, the Cloverlane Mattress is built with breathability in mind. In addition to the aforementioned cover, there are 16 hand-installed brass vents along the base to boost airflow. (The vents are on the hybrid and memory foam versions.) It may not have the same effect as a dedicated cooling mattress but for most people, the Cloverlane Mattress should be comfortable enough.

To test the motion isolation of my twin-size Cloverlane Hybrid, I performed a drop test with an empty wine glass and a 10lb weight. I dropped the weight from six inches above the surface from three distances to simulate three levels of motion transfer. In addition to that, I also noticed how quickly the weight settled.

When I dropped the weight from four inches away, the glass fell over. I repeated this drop for insurance and the glass didn't drop but it did wobble quite a bit. These results suggest that it's perhaps not the best choice for couples with a restless partner.

Fortunately, the empty glass remained steady when I dropped the weight from 12 and 25 inches away. This means you're unlikely to be disturbed if your partner gets in or out of bed. Meanwhile, the 10lb weight settled into the surface after a few short bounces, indicating good absorption of movement.

The all-foam version of the Cloverlane likely performs even better here, but the Cloverlane Hybrid has a nice bouncy rhythm while maintaining a low level of motion transfer. Either way, I think the Cloverlane Mattress will allow most couples to sleep uninterrupted.

To test the edge support of my Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid mattress, I placed a 50lb weight on the middle perimeter, where it sank about three inches. It was the same result when I put the weight at the very foot of the bed. That's the same level of sinkage I measured at the center of the bed - which is usually a good thing, but that's quite a deep drop for the edges.

Among my fellow testers, opinions were mixed. Along the middle, my lighter and taller volunteers said they were comfortable but the shorter sleepers in my group felt unsteady. (Everyone felt at ease sitting at the foot of the bed.) Meanwhile, I tend to roll toward the edge when I sleep, but the Cloverlane's edges kept me from falling overboard.

Of course, I can only speak for a twin-sized Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid. There's a possibility larger, firmer versions perform better here. There currently aren't any reviews that mention the Cloverlane's edge support. But if you want a mattress that's known for strong edges on even the smallest bed sizes, read my Awara Natural Hybrid mattress review, which I also tested in a twin.

The Cloverlane Mattress arrives flat via free White Glove Delivery. The most I had to do was schedule a delivery time, which was not the smoothest experience. However, your mileage may vary here as you'll be dealing with a local logistics company. Fortunately, the day of the delivery went off without a hitch as the delivery crew arrived right on time. The whole process took less than 10 minutes, and that even included the free mattress removal.

Interestingly, my Cloverlane Hybrid arrived flat but still came in a box. The two delivery drivers removed my mattress from a giant brown box from the back of their truck before taking it into my home. I peeked at the mattress tag, which says it was manufactured in August 2024. I received my mattress in December 2024, about four months later. Despite that, my Cloverlane Hybrid Mattress didn't have an obvious off-gassing smell, and it was ready to sleep on right away. It's not your typical bed-in-a-box.

The Cloverlane comes with a one-year warranty, with free returns if you're not happy with it. There's also a lifetime warranty, which includes a free replacement with a factory defect for the first 10 years you own the mattress. Beyond that, you'll just have to pay a $50 transportation fee each way for repairs.

✅ You have a bad back: Between the free in-room delivery and the specialized lumbar support, the Cloverlane should relieve many sleepers with back pain. I didn't wake up with stiffness in my lower back throughout my month of sleeping on the Cloverlane Hybrid. The American Chiropractic Association gives it its seal of approval.

✅ You want to customize your comfort: The Cloverlane is available as a hybrid (reviewed here) or all-foam mattress in three firmness levels. There's no price difference between the two types of builds, either, which is rare. (Hybrids are usually more expensive than foam beds.)

✅ You want a bed that's easy to move: The side carry handles will make rotating your mattress much less of a challenge. They're also handy if you move house often or like to rearrange your space regularly.

❌ You can afford a Saatva: The Saatva Classic boasts better craftsmanship and a more sumptuous appearance than the Cloverlane Mattress. If you have enough for Saatva, make that your choice. It's only about $200 to $400 more than either version of the Cloverlane Mattress. Plus, Saatva offers free mattress and foundation removal.

❌ You don't want a bed with a long break-in period: My Plush Soft Cloverlane Hybrid was definitely firm at first, and one month later I'd downgrade it to a medium-firm. You'll need to be patient and allow yourself time to fully break this mattress in. Fortunately, Cloverlane gives you a year to do that.

❌ You'd rather buy a mattress without fiberglass: Cloverlane doesn't make it clear if it uses fiberglass in its mattresses. If you're sensitive to fiberglass or simply don't want to sleep on a bed that has it, check out our vetted list of the best fiberglass-free mattresses.

I slept on a twin Cloverlane Hybrid mattress in Plush Firm every night for one month between December 2023 and January 2024. My review is a combination of real-world experience and objective tests.

In addition to my perspective as a 5-foot-4, 145lb side/stomach sleeper with a lower back issue, I asked four adult volunteers to nap on the Cloverlane for at least 15 minutes in their usual positions. Our testers ranged in size from 5ft 4 and 125lbs to 6ft and 185lbs, and one of them deals with arthritis.

The best-known type of distributed ledger is a blockchain, so named because it stores individual transactions in groups, or blocks, attached to each other in chronological order to form a chain.

Distributed ledger technology has been used to transfer different types of assets between buyer and seller. These include new types of assets, such as crypto-assets and stablecoins, as well as long-established financial assets, such as securities.

The ECB is currently exploring the potential of these emerging technologies, monitoring market developments in this area and analysing the possible interactions between its own infrastructures - TARGET Services - and market distributed ledger technology platforms.

Different types of assets have emerged alongside the new technologies and are being researched, monitored and assessed at the European and international level.

In recent years, we have seen many new types of assets popping up that are recorded on blockchains or other distributed ledgers. This started with bitcoin and similar crypto-assets. Later, stablecoins were introduced in an attempt to address the high volatility of other crypto-assets.

Crypto-assets are recorded in digital form, enabled by the use of cryptography and distributed ledger technology. They are also known as cryptocurrencies, though this name is misleading, as they don't fulfil the three functions of money: a reliable medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.

Unlike euro banknotes or money held on a payment account, crypto-assets typically do not represent a financial claim on, or a liability towards, any identifiable entity.

Moreover, crypto-assets are typically not backed or managed by any central institution. You have no guarantee that you will be able to exchange them for money when you need to. The specific risk profile and high volatility of crypto-assets results from this absence of any underlying fundamental value.

Bitcoin is one of the many private crypto-assets available on the market. Essentially, it is a digital token that can be exchanged electronically and that does not exist in a physical form.

Like bitcoin and similar crypto-assets, stablecoins are recorded on a distributed ledger. Stablecoins are designed to try to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reference asset. Stablecoins that are backed by a reserve in an official currency are called e-money tokens: electronic money recorded on a distributed ledger. Stablecoins that are backed by other assets, such as gold, are called asset-referenced tokens. There are also crypto-assets that rely on algorithms to minimise fluctuations in their prices, called algorithmic stablecoins, but these have proven to be unsuccessful in maintaining a stable value.

A significant amount of work on distributed ledger technology and crypto-assets has been undertaken in Europe and at the international level.

A uniform legal framework for the crypto-asset market in Europe has been adopted. Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) covers crypto-assets that are not regulated by existing financial services legislation. Key provisions for those issuing and trading crypto-assets (including asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) cover the transparency, disclosure, authorisation and supervision of transactions. The new legal framework supports market integrity and financial stability by regulating public offers of crypto-assets.

Standard-setting bodies and international institutions are undertaking analytical and policy work on crypto-assets, stablecoins and decentralised finance in the areas of their respective mandates.

The Bank for International Settlement's Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) is conducting work on the applications of distributed ledger technology and is also analysing and monitoring other payment innovations.

The CPMI and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are assessing the application of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures to different stablecoin arrangements. In addition, the CPMI are studying how stablecoin arrangements could potentially improve cross-border payments.

The Bank for International Settlements and the central banks of the euro area are working together at the BIS Innovation Hub Eurosystem Centre to develop Project Atlas. This project will create an open-source data platform that can shed light on the macroeconomic relevance of crypto-asset markets, combining different data sources to offer regulators and policymakers reliable insights. In the first phase, Project Atlas will visualise cross-border flows by mapping the geographic locations of blockchain transactions between crypto exchanges.",ecb.europa.eu,news,European Central Bank,,0.2156862745098038,448983970,1,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/shared/img/socialmedia/social-default.jpg?5609fefdb059590b375eafe2c236bf5c,

However, batteries have long been an obstacle to their full development. Harvesting energy from the environment is a promising alternative to battery power, but traditional radio transceivers consume too much for most harvesters. This work is motivated by backscatter communications, a technique that reduces the energy that devices spend exchanging data by up to three orders of magnitude relative to regular radios. This reduction enables sensing devices that operate indefinitely without having to replace batteries; instead they leverage energy harvesting. My goal is to enable the seamless integration of battery-free devices with widespread low-power commodity networks such as Bluetooth or ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4. Making this integration seamless is critical for the broad adoption of the new class of devices.At a high level, my dissertation outlines a series of challenges to the seamless integration of the new devices with regular low-power networks. We then propose ways to address these challenges, and demonstrate how we could integrate ultra-low-power battery-free devices with regular networks, while avoiding hardware modifications and minimizing any disruption that the addition may cause to existing and co-located communication devices.This work advances the state of the art by: First, demonstrating how to augment an existing sensor network with new sensors without any hardware modification to the pre-existing hardware. The existing network provides the unmodulated carrier that the battery-free nodes need to communicate. Second, we demonstrate a radio receiver that, if implemented in silicon, can directly receive low-power commodity wireless signals when assisted by an unmodulated carrier, and with a power consumption of a few hundred microwatts. The receiver makes battery-free devices directly compatible with regular networks. We introduce simulation models and a first-of-its-kind tool to simulate battery-free communications that integrate with regular networks. Finally, we demonstrate how to efficiently provide unmodulated carrier support for battery-free devices in the previous scenarios without unnecessarily spending energy and spectrum and without undue disturbance to co-located devices.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1294117647058823,448980600,1,,

Uzbekistan plans to establish production of hybrid and electric cars up to 500,000 per year, Trend reports.

President Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a relevant decree on the implementation of an investment project for the production of electric and hybrid cars and their components in Uzbekistan on March 18.

According to the paper, Uzbekistan plans to raise the level of localization of these cars by up to 60 percent which is foreseen to create 10,000 jobs.

The authorities also aim to broaden the list of nations that can permanently export hybrid and electric vehicles to Uzbekistan, with the exception of those identified by the Joint Investment Enterprise.

Consumer protection is a critical consideration: electric vehicles and hybrids must be of excellent quality, safe, and appropriate for local weather conditions.

Manufacturers or exporters are also obliged to provide warranty service.

All automakers in Uzbekistan will have equal conditions, including receiving benefits and preferences from the state.

Earlier in 2022, Uzavtosanoat and China's BYD Auto agreed to organize full-cycle car production in Uzbekistan. Prior to that, the parties had been studying the automobile market.

On December 29, 2022, Uzavtosanoat (60 percent stake) and BYD Europe B. V. (Netherlands, 40 percent) established a joint venture BYD Uzbekistan Factory. On September 26, 2023, a project implementation agreement was signed between the government of Uzbekistan and the investor.

(Saturday, March 23, 2024) - Felix Rosenqvist and Alex Palou each battled gusty winds and changing track conditions Saturday to claim poles for the two heat races Sunday setting the field for The Thermal Club $1 Million Challenge.

Rosenqvist and reigning NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Palou will be at the head of the field for their respective 10-lap heat races Sunday on the 17-turn, 3.067-mile desert circuit near Palm Springs, California. The top six finishers in each of those heats will compete in the Sprint for the Purse, a two-segment, 20-lap feature race that awards $500,000 to the winner.

SEE: Heat 1 Qualifying Results | Heat 2 Qualifying Results

Live coverage of the two heat races and non-points Sprint for the Purse starts at 12:30 p.m. ET Sunday on NBC, Peacock and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

""It's an angry pack behind in the mirror,"" Rosenqvist of starting from the front in the heat. ""I think it's about the start and getting away, but, man, everyone's going to go for it. That's the beauty and the curse of this format. Everyone is just going to give it all, and that's what we did now and ended up first.""

Rosenqvist continued his strong performance from the season opener earlier this month in St. Petersburg by taking the top spot for the first 10-lap heat with a best lap of 1 minute, 38.5831 seconds in the No. 60 AutoNation/SiriusXM Honda despite problems with his push-to-pass mechanism during testing earlier today. The Swede qualified second and finished seventh in the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg presented by RP Funding in the first points-paying event of the season and his first with Meyer Shank Racing.

""We tried to stay calm after the morning; we had kind of a messy session,"" Rosenqvist said. ""I just tried to forget that session, take a deep breath and do it all again.

""It's so tricky out there, man. The wind is changing every lap. There's dust on the track. I was first out (in qualifying), so I was worried there was going to be poor grip. But I could focus on my tire warmup like we did yesterday, and I felt a bit more confident when I went for the lap. I guess all we had to do is put it together, and the speed is there. Awesome.""

Scott McLaughlin will join Rosenqvist on the front row for the first heat race after his best lap of 1:38.6068 in the No. 3 XPEL Team Penske Chevrolet. Rinus VeeKay will be on the inside of Row 2 in the first heat after his qualifying lap of 1:38.6283 in the No. 21 Ed Carpenter Racing Chevrolet.

Christian Lundgaard, quickest overall in two days of testing here Friday and today, qualified fourth for the first heat at 1:38.6394 in the No. 45 Hy-Vee Honda fielded by Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.

Each qualifying group - determined by a blind draw Thursday night at this private automotive club - had just eight minutes on track. The first group was clean other than a few drivers putting a Firestone Firehawk tire wide and kicking sand and dirt on the track. The second group faced more pressure when Marcus Ericsson spun off track and backed into the tire barrier in Turn 9 in the No. 28 Delaware Life Honda fielded by Andretti Global, spawning a red flag and freezing the clock with just one minute, 19 seconds left.

That forced the other 12 drivers in Group Two to decide whether they wanted to stand pat on their existing times or go for broke on one final trip around the circuit when the session resumed.

Two-time series champion Palou decided to take a chance in his No. 10 DHL Chip Ganassi Racing Honda as the wind picked up and swirled sand and dust around the circuit. Palou, who led both test sessions Friday, produced the top lap of qualifying with his Group 2-topping run of 1:38.5675 despite having only 14 seconds of push-to-pass left for that lap.

""Looking forward to tomorrow,"" Palou said. ""After all that confusion with the red flag and everything, we didn't know if we were going to be able to put a lap together. But happy with that.

""We were using everything (push-to-pass) on that lap before it went red, so happy with that pace. The car is good.""

Palou will start on the pole for the 20-lap Sprint for the Purse - divided into two-lap segments - if he wins his heat race because he produced the quickest lap of the two qualifying segments.

It will be an all-Chip Ganassi Racing front row for the second heat race as Marcus Armstrong qualified second at 1:38.7575 in the No. 11 Ridgeline Lubricants Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Graham Rahal, who struggled for pace here Friday and today in testing, found grip at just the right time to qualify third at 1:38.9723 in the No. 15 Fifth Third Bank Honda fielded by Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Rookie Linus Lundqvist completed a strong second qualifying group for CGR and will start fourth after his best lap of 1:39.0685 in the No. 8 American Legion Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.",speedwaymedia.com,news,Speedway Media,,0.1764705882352942,448979239,1,,eng-9421043

Got to stay out of trouble to start, and then I think our longevity should prove to be pretty competitive. Proud of the Hitachi Chevrolet crew.

A pretty strong start to the season with Chevrolet, a pretty strong package...

""Chevy's done a great job. They continue to bring us great performance on the weekend. Excited to get through tomorrow, but also really excited to get back to Long Beach as well and keep proving our worth.""

Scott McLaughlin, No. 3 Chevrolet at Team Penske:

""I'm hell bent. To have a qualifying session which was just bang, bang, bang in a shootout lap, one lap, is pretty awesome and that's effectively what that was. To do a good job there was good. Congrats to Felix (Rosenqvist). I feel like I could have had him. I just marked up that last corner, but that's... You've got to do the lap, it's pressure, and that's cool.""

You've got to get it right on the push-to-pass lap...

""Exactly. I think that'd be really cool, but I think our XPEL Chevy was great. Obviously, Chevy has been giving us great power this year and fuel mileage so really stoked for everyone there, and hopefully we can keep this XPEL Chevy up front.""

So what do you expect for the heat race tomorrow? How do you approach that?

""We'll do what we can. Every race, we go out and try to win it. It's a learning process too. We'll figure out what the car does even more so over ten laps, but yeah, I'll be doing my best to at least get ahead of Felix (Rosenqvist). It's going to be interesting where we'll shake up at the end of ten laps.""

Will Power, No. 12 Chevrolet at Team Penske:

""Because you have push-to-pass, it's just one lap and big (degradation). It's very difficult to wait two hours, then have a different condition and just go. It's tough.""

Did you know what the track was going to be like?

""I did. I tried a couple of different things and made mistakes. I mean, honestly, the quickest time was a quick time. It was hard to put all of that together. For (Felix) Rosenqvist to be P1 is solid.""

How do you think the heat races will play out?

""It just depends on what you want to do. I don't feel like doing much damage for P6 or something. It's such a short race, anything can happen.""

With all of the test sessions, do you feel as a group it was worth it? You were able to try a bunch of different stuff.

""I think the whole qualifying and racing made you not try stuff. You were doing these qualifying sims because you knew the only way you'll do well in these things is qualifying up front.""

Pato O'Ward, No. 5 Chevrolet at Arrow McLaren:

""This track is very sensitive to heat, wind. It was getting really gusty, especially there in the back over by the esses. There was a lot of sand on track. You could see it from the rooster tails coming out of the cars. As it was for us, it wasn't the most perfect lap for me, but I just could never get the car to set. It was always wanting to go the opposite direction of where I wanted it to go. It was a bit of a fight out there, but it seems like we're not the only ones. A lot of guys are struggling with it, and it's just really, really gusty and feels icy out there.""

Do you remember a weekend like this where it's different to run all the time?

""Not in INDYCAR, but in a Formula 1 test, yes. Those cars are really, really wind sensitive and I feel like we're getting a taste of that here. Maybe in Indy, where you're going so fast and the wind is a bit more of a factor. It's definitely shifted a lot. You think you have a good car, and then you're going into it and what happened to the balance? Not that if felt horrible, but it just never actually got into, I feel like, an operating window. I feel the tires never got to their sweet spot, and this qualifying session that we've with overtake, you've got one lap to do it. Once you choose your lap, you've got to stick with it. I'm glad that we tried in Lap 2, I think Callum (Ilott) did as well. But it seems that we're not the only ones that are struggling.""

Rinus VeeKay, No. 21 Chevrolet at Ed Carpenter Racing:

""It's interesting. Just like this whole weekend, right? It's different. You've got the push-to-pass too, which usually you can focus on one thing, but now we're pressing a button on the top of the steering wheel. It felt really good. One thing about this track, with the wind and basically a sandstorm that came through, every session, maybe every outing, the car felt different. We just kind of nailed it for the conditions the way they were. A little bit surprised. Didn't feel as good as in practice, but very, very happy and great job by the guys.""

What will be the biggest key tomorrow? Will it be aggressiveness? Conservative?

""Staying on track. I think that's my thing. You only have to lead one lap and that's the last one. First got to make it through to the all-star race and then to the $1 Million Challenge, and then we look forward there. This starting position definitely makes tomorrow a little bit easier.

If you're second with $500,000 on the line, are you willing to move someone to win?

""If I'm close enough and I see a gap, I'll definitely go for it.""

Romain Grosjean, No. 77 Chevrolet at Juncos Hollinger Racing:

""We knew qualifying was going to be a challenge. Very tricky conditions out there. I made a small mistake in our lap that cost us, but we are up there in the mix, so a lot of potential in the car.""

Agustin Canapino, No. 78 Chevrolet at Juncos Hollinger Racing:

""We are in a good position. Honestly, the lap wasn't good. We didn't find the speed in the fastest corner, and we need to check what happened. But the good thing is we are in a good position for tomorrow to try and make it to the main race.""

From that kind of position, you know you need to pick up a couple of spots. What is the approach in this short heat race tomorrow?

""I think the target is try to end better. Of course, we are starting P8 alongside my teammate Romain (Grosjean). We need to only need to advance two positions. It will be difficult of course. Many good drivers and top teams, but we had a good car, especially in practice. We were much better.

Thermal, Calif. (23 March 2024) - The Thermal Club $1 Million Challenge may be a new event on the 2024 NTT INDYCAR SERIES calendar, but Felix Rosenqvist and Meyer Shank Racing (MSR) found nothing new about their qualifying results as the Swede scored the pole for Sunday's heat race 1 in today's qualifying at the 17-turn, 3.067-mile circuit near Palm Springs.

As he did two weeks ago in the season opener in St. Petersburg, Rosenqvist took his No. 60 AutoNation / SiriusXM Honda to the front row in qualifying, leading the session that set the starting grid for Sunday's first heat race. The results of the heats will determine which 12 drivers qualify for the feature race, with the top six from each heat advancing to the 20-lap main event.

Rosenqvist and MSR bounced back from an issue in Saturday's final test session as the Bon Jovi Radio (SiriusXM Ch. 312) themed car was unable to use its push-to-pass feature. The team worked through the session and during the hours leading to qualifying to diagnose the problem, giving Rosenqvist the opportunity to have all his Honda power at his disposal in the 12-minute session.

The short session meant that teams realistically had two flying laps to settle the score, but Rosenqvist worked quickly to put up a time of 1:38.5831 (111.999mph) to lead his session.

Tom Blomqvist (No. 66 AutoNation / Arctic Wolf Honda) ran in the second qualifying session and finished a strong fifth in a truncated outing that was reduced to a one-lap shootout due to a mid-session crash. The British-born driver will start on the inside of the third row in tomorrow's second heat after carding a time of 1:39.0920 (111.435mph).

Sunday's two heat races will be contested over 10 laps, or 20 minutes, with the first six finishers from each heat moving on to the feature race. Sunday's finale will consist of two 10-lap segments, with teams allowed to refuel and make any changes during the break.

The winner of the second segment will take home $500,000 with $350,000 going to the runner-up and $250,000 to the third-place driver.

The Thermal Club $1 Million Challenge will air on NBC on Sunday starting at 12:30 p.m. ET. SiriusXM will also host live INDYCAR Radio coverage of both sessions on XM Ch. 218.

Meyer Shank Racing Driver Quotes:

Felix Rosenqvist: ""We tried to stay cool after a tough morning session, we took a deep breath and worked on the problem. But the team did a great job getting ready and we ended up with another great car. The test sessions have been great for us as a team this weekend. We're jelling, we are figuring out what we need to do to be fast and I feel good. It's an angry pack to be ahead of (for tomorrow's heat race), but if we can get away clean at the start, we should be OK because the (tire) degradation isn't too bad. But the guys are going to be coming at us hard.

Tom Blomqvist: ""I'm really happy. I am slowly, but surely going in the right direction. Yesterday was really difficult for me, but we made really good steps overnight with the car. I'm just focusing on getting more comfortable every lap and learning what I need from the car to go fast.""",speedwaymedia.com,news,Speedway Media,,0.05882352941176472,448979217,1,,eng-9421043

On the heels of that finding, they released their Top 100 list of top companies for remote work in 2024. Some of the primo companies may surprise you: CVS Health, Williams-Sonoma, New York Life, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Zillow, to name a few.

But the enduring and dramatic shift toward remote work isn't surprising industry insiders.

""Even the most reluctant hybrid employers have now mostly accepted that some degree of remote work is here to stay, especially if you have to compete for any sort of skilled or scarce employees,"" said Alexandra Samuel, Ph.D. and co-author of ""Remote, Inc.: How to Thrive at Work ... Wherever You Are"" (Harper Business, 2021).

Jared Brown, co-founder and CEO of Hubstaff, a remote workforce management platform, echoed that sentiment.

""In the coming years, I predict that we'll see an even greater surge in remote job opportunities, with more industries recognizing the value and feasibility of remote work,"" the Atlanta entrepreneur said. ""This shift will be powered by advancements in technology that make remote collaboration more seamless and by a growing workforce demand for flexibility and autonomy.""

Companies that adapt to this trend and invest in remote-friendly policies and technologies will lead the market, attracting top talent from around the globe, he predicted.

FlexJobs is seeing firsthand just how much the tide is changing.

""Historically, fields like computer and IT and accounting/finance had the most remote job openings, as the type of tasks required for these roles lend themselves really well to working from home,"" said Toni Frana, M.S., lead career expert at FlexJobs, based in Niceville, Fla. ""But since the pandemic, we've seen many other fields, such as medical and health, operations, customer service and administrative, increase the number of remote positions offered.""

Per Frana, the accessibility of remote work has also created more opportunities across various career and education levels, pointing to WFH offerings on its site across experienced (64%), manager (19%), senior (12%) and entry (5%) levels. (You can also scope out remote jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree on the site.)

FlexJobs survey data found that 63% say remote work is the most important aspect of their job, even over salary (61%) and having a good boss (48%).

Frana shares that FlexJobs research shows there are some WFH-friendly jobs most people may not think of as an immediate fit, like culinary specialist, wildfire resilience environmental project manager, veterinary technician, psychiatric nurse practitioner and speech language pathologist.

""While these types of roles haven't always been the norm, it demonstrates the demand for and expansion of remote work across new industries,"" she said.

Along those lines, Brown shares that roles like virtual health care providers, online educators, remote legal consultants and remote lab technicians are becoming increasingly common. ""These positions challenge the traditional notion that certain jobs require a physical presence,"" he said.

Samuel pinpoints health care as one of the most interesting remote fields to watch ""because it's one of the very few places where the ability to work remotely is limited among high-wage and high-status employees,"" like doctors and physicians' assistants.

By contrast, in many fields we see middle and upper managers with hybrid or remote flexibility, said Samuel, and frontline workers like retail, manufacturing or service workers feeling resentful they don't get that flexibility.

Samuel believes the move toward remote health care will be sticking around for the long haul. She cites online therapy, for instance, as becoming so omnipresent that it's transforming the way mental health services are delivered. Even in more niche applications in mental health, telehealth is becoming more commonplace: ""I would never have imagined that behavioral supports for autistic kids could be delivered online, but they are,"" Samuel said.

We're only at the tip of the iceberg, per Brown. ""This broadening of fields reflects a growing recognition of the efficiency and effectiveness of remote work across different sectors,"" he said. ""The expansion of remote work into various fields is set to continue, and accelerate, breaking more traditional barriers.""

Brown foresees a future where even more sectors, like manufacturing and science, find innovative ways to incorporate remote work into their operations.

If you're interested in exploring more unconventional remote careers, Brown recommends resources such as Remote.co, and We Work Remotely, coupled with ""upskilling"" through online courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.

When considering a career in any field, Frana stressed the importance of starting by researching the requirements of the job. ""For example, there may be unexpected licensing requirements for certain health care roles, like nurse practitioners or speech language pathologists, whereas the role as a culinary specialist may have more general, experience-heavy needs,"" she said.

Don't overlook having a competitive résumé and cover letter.

""If you're someone looking to make a career change, it's especially critical to highlight your transferable skills to the role. With remote roles specifically, highlighting your technology knowledge, strong communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills is an excellent practice,"" said Frana.

Frana also states that building resilience throughout your career is a key strategy to success in any future job searches, especially remote jobs. ""Always ensuring you have an updated résumé with your latest work achievements will help you hit the ground running if and when you decide to make a change,"" she said.

""Upskilling and staying on top of the latest trends and advancements in your field will make you a stronger candidate when you apply to jobs, and it shows employers you aren't afraid to take initiative.""

Finally, continuously building relationships and networking is a career strategy that Frana says will never go out of style. So go ahead, and treat that career mentor to a coffee -- whether virtual or in the flesh.",nypost.com,news,New York Post,,0.2627450980392156,448978623,1,https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/newspress-collage-fng4hrwzt-1711282366828.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1711267990&w=1024,eng-9421835

In fact, the up-and-coming Spanish performance brand, which is part of the VW Group, is gearing up for the next chapter in its journey. Just a few days ago, it confirmed plans to expand to the U.S. and Canada by the end of the decade with two models: an electric version of the Formentor crossover and an unnamed ""larger, electric crossover SUV"".

While it remains to be seen which model Cupra is referring to, Seat's spin-off brand is currently putting the final developmental touches on its next addition to the lineup, the Terramar. Cupra previewed the Terramar at its Unstoppable Impulse event two years ago and has stated that it will be their last new vehicle with combustion power.

The Terramar takes its name from the Autódromo de Sitges-Terramar historic racing circuit in Barcelona, Spain, but it takes its engineering lead from Wolfsburg, Germany. The SUV is Cupra's answer to the European VW Tiguan (not to be confused by the North American one) and shares its MQB platform and running gear with the VW. Audi's next Q3 will also be part of that mix and the Cupra will be built at Audi's Gyor plant in Hungary alongside the Formentor.

Not many Terramar buyers will be immediately alerted to the connection when they walk into the showroom. The 4.5 m (177 inches) Cupra SUV has a stronger, less curvy look than the Tiguan and a far more aggressive face with a wide grille, pointy headlights, and a pair of muscular creases in the hood that a designer might have used to signify the presence of a V6 in the old days.

But the Terramar will in fact get the same 1.5-liter and 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engines as the Tiguan, some with mild-hybrid tech and some with full PHEV assistance. The VW offers 201 hp (204 PS) and 268 hp (272 PS) versions of the eHybrid plug-ins, each fitted with a 19.7 kWh battery, and if Cupra sticks with the same power pack we should be looking at a similar 62 miles (100 km) of electric range. All-wheel drive will be optional, but there will be no choice regarding transmissions: a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox will be compulsory.

We haven't had the opportunity to take a look inside the prototypes yet, but given the brand's focus on sportiness, the Terramar could boast a driver-focused interior akin to the Tavascan, highlighted by a V-shaped blade that spans the width of the dashboard and extends down to the center console. Additionally, it is expected to have a dual-screen layout similar to that of the Tiguan.

The new addition to the Cupra lineup is expected to be introduced in the second half of 2024.",carscoops.com,news,Carscoops,Chris Chilton,0.0117647058823529,448976573,1,https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2025-CUPRA-Terramar-prototype-16-copy.jpg,eng-9414708

VeChain forces Ripple and IOTA into fierce competition as it makes an incredible mark in the world of Real-World Assets (RWA) with its supply chain solution. Having made a mark as a go-to platform for asset tokenization, the VeChain ecosystem, hosted on the VeChainThor blockchain, has transformed the industry with the provision of fast transactions to real-world activities. Interestingly, it is expected to dominate the market with HSBC and Northern Trust estimating that 5-10% of all assets would be tokenized by 2030.

Ripple also chases after dominance with its recent integration with Axelar reported by Crypto News Flash. Drawing insight from that report, three other blockchains - Chainlink, and IOTA, currently remain another dominant force in the trillion-dollar market as they seek to attract a chunk of the market share. Ripple's partnership would seamlessly deploy cross-chain decentralized applications on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) via Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP). In the long run, RWA tokenization adoption would be accelerated on the XRPL.

A recent report by the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple David Schwartz discloses that real estate and commodities would be the backbone of tokenization in the future.

Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization will drive the blockchain economy, led by real estate and commodities. Tokenized RWAs on XRP Ledger will enhance collateralized loans, improve interoperability, and attract institutional adoption, reshaping the financial sector. #XRPL will be a leading blockchain enabling these use cases.

VeChain's recent activities focus on all sectors of its ecosystem as it just sealed a partnership agreement with a leading mobile payment app Oobit to integrate VET into its platform. This was earlier reported by Crypto News Flash. According to the report, the plan is to enable users to utilize it for their day-to-day transactions while fulfilling its ESG mission. VeChain's CEO, Sunny Lu commented on the partnership.

VeChain is excited to partner with Oobit, merging our commitment to ESG initiatives with Oobit's innovative approach. The integration of VET into Oobit's platform is not just a technological enhancement; it's a tangible step towards making blockchain technology synonymous with positive societal impact.

A big-money, all-star, no-points racing showdown. Unlimited, free soft-serve ice cream. The NTT IndyCar Series' inaugural $1 Million Challenge will be a race like no other.

But ... maybe that's a good thing.

The Thermal Club is not the only country-club style motorsports facility in the world - one opened last year outside Tokyo - but it is the first such venue to play host to wheel-to-wheel action from a major American racing series.

After hosting pre-season testing in 2023, the Southern California venue will be the stage of IndyCar's first non-points exhibition since 1992's Marlboro Challenge at Nazareth Speedway.

The 17-turn, 3.067-mile layout first used by IndyCar in 2023's pre-season test combines two of Thermal's three basic tracks (the ""red"" and ""blue"" layouts), with the two meeting in the distinctively awkward turns 16-17 complex, where the ideal racing line forces drivers over the curbs - and one massive bump that brings Sebring International Raceway to mind. The track is challenging, exacerbated by the Coachella Valley's propensity for sudden temperature changes, gusty winds and dust storms, all of which affected the order on the timing sheets through Saturday's (March 23) twin test sessions and modified two-group qualifying format. The racing surface itself isn't the problem.

The problem is, it's difficult to see it.

There are very few ground-level areas at Thermal with clear sightlines over the acres of steel guardrail, making it very difficult for fans to catch a glimpse of a speeding open-wheel racecar.

Formula 1 fans familiar with critiques of Hermann Tilke's work may know that tracks designed to challenge drivers in single-car runs don't always produce the most thrilling side-by-side action. The Thermal Club adds an interesting twist. It isn't a regular racetrack, it's designed from the ground up to provide a thrilling experience for its members, who pay dues for the privilege of driving it in any manner of high-end production cars or track-day specials. Every square inch of the facility is dedicated to helping people live out their Forza Horizon (or Test Drive: Unlimited, for the older generation) fantasy.

Thermal's needs are unique, so of course track designers had other priorities than accommodating grandstands. Adapting the track to host an IndyCar series race that requires teams, media, VIPs and fans was always going to be a challenge.

The facility wasn't designed to host several thousand people arriving on race day, it was designed to host small groups of drivers and their guests.

Even finding parking for the IndyCar series personnel, media, and VIPs required some creativity: the team parking lot is itself a section of an unused track layout, Team Penske's rental Chevrolet Malibus are tackling the same type of red-and-white curbs as Will Power's Chevy IndyCar.

Holding a race at Thermal, showing off the location and putting IndyCar's teams and drivers in contact with the high-rolling motorsports enthusiasts, required a different approach than say, the series' planned return to the Milwaukee Mile later this year.

Another controversial Southern California motorsports exhibition, NASCAR's Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum, provides an interesting counterpoint. The quarter-mile bullring that NASCAR dropped in the middle of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum never allowed such speeds as to look spectacular on a screen - but the track's short distance and stadium seating allowed in-person spectators to clearly see the entire track at once.

Fewer than 65,000 people bought a ticket to the inaugural Clash at the Coliseum, compared to over four million who watched it at home.

With Thermal, IndyCar is taking the opposite approach. Push-to-pass will be available from the drop of the green flag. Caution laps won't count towards the total. There will be two heat races with eliminations. Drivers are expecting chaos - Heat 2 polesitter Alex Palou joked he'd like to ""add a bumper"" to the rear of his No. 10 Honda for the approach to turn 1.

Aside, of course, from the drivers', the best seat in the house for the $1 Million Challenge is going to be in front of a television screen.

This is a gamble for IndyCar. Holding a race behind closed doors, rubbing shoulders with high-rollers and hoping that a glimpse into their world and the promise of a $500,000 payday to a driver motivates people to tune in is not a guarantee. It is, in the words of Felix Rosenqvist, ""an experiment.""

But if IndyCar is set on racing at Thermal, it's clear from the ground that this is the only option. To host a full-fat IndyCar weekend, the facility would need to massively expand. It would likely have to become a different type of racetrack entirely. The $1 Million Challenge feels like a compromise, but it might be the only one that works.",frontstretch.com,news,Frontstretch,Jack Swansey,0.2392156862745098,448976338,1,https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1691-3-1-scaled.jpg,

Summary

A PHEV like the Mercedes S580e offers the best of both worlds for daily commuting and long-distance travel with impressive range. The S580e's power and fast charging capabilities make it a standout in the PHEV market for luxury performance and convenience. A statement-making arrival awaits you in the S580e, an elegant and luxurious option with top-tier comfort and customization for every drive.

A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) can be the best of both worlds -- combining the lower charging costs at home versus when filling up with gas, along with the long-distance capability and reassurance of having a gas engine.

Just imagine having enough electric range for your daily commute, and then when you need to travel long distances, that's probably going to be the only time you'll use the internal combustion engine (ICE). A PHEV is, of course, only as good as it can be when you treat it as intended by charging it every day, but that's a story for another day.

The long electric range that a PHEV can offer is beneficial for everyday use, and so, with that said, you're probably curious to find out which PHEV has the longest overall range. Not just the electric range, but the total range it has when combining both the battery and the fuel tank as an energy source.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Mercedes-Benz and other authoritative sources, including Car and Driver and AAA.

Go Big And Go Far With The Mercedes S580e

Close

The luxury PHEV with the longest range is the Mercedes-Benz S580e 4Matic. EPA has rated it at 470 miles, whereas real-world testing by Car and Driver showed that this S-Class PHEV can do 688 miles on a full tank and a full charge.

The S580e Is A Range Overachiever

Based on experience, a lot of German ICE cars are able to travel really far due to their large fuel tanks. In the case of the S580e, you get a 17.7-gallon fuel tank, which is a bit smaller than the non-PHEV models of the S-Class which have a 22.1-gallon tank. Impressively, even with the fuel tank shrunk by five gallons, the S580e was able to achieve a real-world gas-only range of 630 miles.

The reason why the S580e has a smaller gas tank compared to the non-PHEV versions is, of course, that the batteries have to go somewhere within the vehicle's packaging. That battery, by the way, is quite large at 28.6 kWh, which enables a few interesting feats for the S580e. That means plenty of pure electric range, and while the EPA rates it to be able to do 46 miles when fully charged, the folks at Car and Driver managed to achieve a real-world range of 58 miles.

That's nearly double the average daily driving distance of an American, which stands at 30.1 miles per day. So yes, with an S580e, it will be feasible for you to do your daily drives in pure electric and only use the ICE when traveling for long distances.

The Plug-in Hybrid Setup Is A Powerhouse

The S580e's PHEV drivetrain is an overachiever in many respects, and that also translates to its power. The S580e combines a 3.0-liter turbocharged straight-six that produces 362 horses and 369 pound-feet of torque on its own, while the electric motor produces 148 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque.

As a result, its combined output is 503 horsepower and 553 pound-feet, which is sent through all four wheels via a nine-speed automatic. With these numbers, the S580e can scoot from 0-60 mph in just 4.8 seconds, and you'll be accelerating to that speed in a manner that's more cossetting as opposed to giving you motion sickness.

Fewer Fuel Stops, More Time For What Matters

By splurging on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz S580e 4Matic, you'll appreciate the fact that you don't have to fill up the car as often. Traveling far per fillup, after all, is also a luxury in its own right, as you'll be spending more time on what matters the most--reaching your business meetings across the state in luxury and comfort.

It's A PHEV That Can Fast Charge, Too

Being a PHEV, charge times will also be worth considering, but you'll be glad to know that even if you do stop for a charge (which isn't necessary, but still worth doing), the S580e won't need to do the stop for such a long time.

That's because the S580e can accept up to 60 kW of DC fast charging, which isn't common as most PHEVs are only capable of accepting AC charging. At 60 kW DC, this is good enough for a 10 to 80 percent charge in just 20 minutes, while charging at the maximum AC output of 11 kW is good for zero to full in 2.25 hours.

It Can Perform As Fast As It Charges

Though the S580e has impressive performance figures, it is not in any way, shape, or form, a sports sedan. Measuring 208.2 inches, this is nearly as long as an Escalade (standard length, not the ESV), and with the vehicle weighing 5,375 pounds (subject to alterations, depending on the selected features and optional extras), it's also not an agile luxury sedan.

Though, on Mercedes-Benz's credit, the S-Class doesn't drive like a boat, either. It's really more for wafting through the worst potholes and traveling in tranquility when you're out on the highway.

This is especially true with the S580's AIRMATIC adaptive self-leveling air suspension, which constantly adjusts its damping variability to what the sensors feel when you go over bumps. However, with the E-Active Body Control (which was discontinued in the GLE), the S-Class also can keep itself flat when tackling corners whilst having the electronic system independently control the motions of each wheel when going over bumps.

Combined with the light steering, the abundance of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), as well as the refined nature of how the body structure cancels out noise and vibrations, you've got a PHEV luxury sedan that focuses more on effortless performance as opposed to outright thrills.

Related Why The 2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Is Essentially A Baby S-Class With more tech and luxury than ever before, the latest E-Class closes the gap to the flagship S-Class, and here's how the two Mercedes sedans compare

The S580e Is A PHEV That Announces Your Arrival

By owning a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, whether it's this S580e or not, you are owning a vehicle that only a few have been able to achieve. This is why, whenever you pull up in one at an event or whenever you just pick up the kids from school, all eyes will be towards you--even if it's being driven in silence in pure electric mode.

Making A Statement

And that's not such a bad statement, to begin with, because the 2024 Mercedes-Benz S-Class looks elegantly designed and well-proportioned. The long hood that's matched by a cab-rearward design and an imposing stance makes the S-Class the definitive full-size luxury sedan--even amid newer competition like the BMW 7 Series (and i7) as well as Mercedes-Benz's own EQS flagship luxury sedan that looks more like a jellybean. Arguably, it has a less elegant shape compared to what the S-Class has always been known for.

Of course, being an S-Class, there are a lot of optional extras and customization options that enable you to make this luxury sedan truly yours. An optional extra that's probably worth splurging for is the AMG Line package for $4,300, which makes the S-Class look sportier with its more aggressive front and rear bumpers, sporty wheel designs (starts with standard 19-inch five twin-spoke wheels), as well as the addition of rear-wheel steering that will make the S-Class feel like a smaller car during U-turns.

The S580e Is The Destination Itself

Oftentimes, we tend to be impatient to reach our destination, but if you're in the S580e 4Matic, you'll probably wish that the trip went on for longer. The S-Class has always set the benchmark when it comes to interior luxury, and that's still pretty much the case in 2024.

Sure, it doesn't have the latest and greatest MBUX Hyperscreen that the newer pure electric EQS gets, but that's all for the better because luxury also means having a tactile interior. Besides, no one ever said it was better to poke the screen of an Apple Watch instead of operating the knobs and the crown of a Rolex, right?

That tactility is matched with one of the finest materials on the planet as well as the comfiest seats in the automotive industry. Whether you're the driver or the one being chauffeured at the back, the S-Class range as a whole is a vehicle that puts comfort at the highest priority.

Moreover, you can up the luxury ante at the back when you spec for the $14,500 Executive Line package, which transforms the rear seats into two individual executive-class seats with extended MBUX infotainment system functions through the rear entertainment system and rear console-mounted tablet. This comes on top of features like the Burmester surround sound system, and heated and cooled rear seats with massage, just to name a few.",topspeed.com,news,Top Speed,Isaac Atienza,0.3333333333333333,448974887,1,https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mercedes-benz-s-class_plug-in_hybrid-2021-1600-06.jpg,

NASA prepped the satellite to be shipped to India early last year, following which the integration activities on the satellite commenced at the UR Rao Satellite centre, a dedicated facility that preps ISRO satellites before launch. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson paid the satellite a visit in November last year.

The NISAR mission has experienced a number of delays. It was supposed to launch in December 2023, but was initially delayed to January 2024, then the first half of 2024. Now, a launch readiness review will be conducted on the mission in April 2024. NASA has opted to apply a special coating on the 12 metre radar antenna reflector, which is among NASA's primary contributions to the mission. The large antenna reflector will be stowed away for the launch and deployed in Earth orbit.

The thermal coating is being applied out of an abundance of precaution, to prevent any problems during the deployment. Any increase in temperatures could potentially affect the deployment of the reflector. During the testing of the satellite, personnel identified a potential for the spacecraft to be exposed to temperatures higher than anticipated, during the stowed configuration for the flight. The satellite is being shipped back to the US because of the size and complexity of the reflector.

The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission is the first of its kind collaboration between ISRO and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, one of the foremost aerospace research laboratories in the world. Originally, NASA wanted to use the cheap launch services of ISRO to deploy a satellite with the unique SAR payload, but ISRO declined the proposal. After negotiations, ISRO included its own instrument on board the satellite, and agreed to provide the rocket ride to Earth orbit. The satellite will be able to monitor changes in the vegetation, the cryosphere, and groundwater levels around the world. The satellite will also be able to produce time-lapses of ice sheets.",news9live.com,news,News9live,Aditya Madanapalle,0.08235294117647052,448974421,1,https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NISAR.jpg,eng-9421718

The relentless sophistication of cyber threats demands that our professionals harness hybrid skills, making the need for upskilling and cross-skilling more urgent than ever. There is a need to look at the importance of adapting to future challenges, advocating for a workforce that is not only equipped to combat current threats but is also future-ready.

Navigating Dynamic Cyber Threats

The nature of cyber threats has undergone a significant shift, prompting cybersecurity professionals to venture into uncharted territories. Defence mechanisms once deemed robust now prove insufficient in the face of intricate and evolving challenges. Cybersecurity experts, traditionally specialized in specific domains, find themselves at a crossroads. The call is not just for adaptation but an evolution, extending expertise into realms like application security, cloud security, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The interconnected nature of these technologies demands a holistic approach, where professionals can adapt their skills to address vulnerabilities across diverse platforms.

Fusion of Technical and Soft Skills: A Strategic Blend

At this crucial juncture, a fusion of technical expertise and soft skills, such as communication and adaptability, is not just beneficial; it is necessary for the continued success and resilience of our cybersecurity efforts. Upskilling involves deepening expertise in one's current domain, while cross-skilling entails acquiring proficiency in areas outside one's primary field of expertise. In the context of cybersecurity, professionals must not only enhance their technical abilities but also cultivate soft skills to effectively communicate and collaborate with stakeholders. The ability to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical decision-makers is becoming increasingly vital as cybersecurity becomes an integral component of overall business strategy.

The rapid integration of technology into various industries has made cybersecurity everyone's concern. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals must not only protect systems but also engage with other departments to create a culture of security awareness. Cross-skilling in areas such as risk management, legal compliance, and incident response is crucial for cybersecurity experts to comprehend the broader implications of their work and align their efforts with organizational goals.

Building a Future-Ready Workforce: Responding to Global Demand

The urgency of upskilling and cross-skilling is further underscored by the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals. In the post-pandemic years, the digital transformation across industries has resulted in a massive demand for cybersecurity professionals with the right skills. As per estimates, there are over 5.4 million cybersecurity professionals currently globally, and there are nearly 4 million job openings in the field. In fact, 67% of cybersecurity professionals have reported that their organizations face a shortage of adequately skilled personnel to secure their digital infrastructure.

Even in India, where digital infrastructure has grown by leaps and bounds in the last two years, there is a major need to train more people on cutting-edge cybersecurity practices. As organizations struggle to fill critical cybersecurity roles, existing professionals must take the initiative to expand their skill sets. Training programs, certifications, and continuous learning opportunities can empower cybersecurity experts to bridge the gap between their current knowledge and the ever-evolving threat landscape. Tech enterprises such as Cisco and Deloitte have recognized this need, initiating comprehensive training programs to bridge the skills gap. In September 2023, FutureSkills Prime, a joint initiative between NASSCOM and MeitY (Government of India), have come together to provide cybersecurity reskilling and upskilling trainings to cater to the growing demand for professionals in the arena in India.

In conclusion, as cyber threats evolve, so must the skills of cybersecurity professionals. Embracing change brings unique opportunities for personal and professional growth. Through upskilling and cross-skilling, we can forge a resilient, future-ready workforce leading in cybersecurity excellence. Adapting hybrid skills is no longer optional but a necessity for the dynamic future. By embracing this imperative transformation, individuals and organizations can construct a robust defence against the ever-evolving challenges of the digital age.",financialexpress.com,news,The Financial Express,,0.05098039215686279,448974243,1,https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-29.jpg,eng-9421245

The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) is continuing its research projects on highly efficient gas turbines at the Werner-von-Siemens Centre for Industry and Science e.V. (WvSC) for another two years. The projects, which are funded by the state of Berlin and the European Union, aim to optimize the maintenance, repair, and development process of gas turbine blades and to develop sustainable additive manufacturing solutions.

Gas turbines play a crucial role in energy generation. Their efficiency and sustainability are of great importance because if less fuel is needed to generate the same amount of energy, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Current challenges, such as the wear of turbine blades due to corrosion and harsh operating conditions, require innovative solutions. The projects aim to use state-of-the-art additive manufacturing processes and digital solutions to increase productivity and performance in gas turbine construction, increase material reusability, and exploit previously untapped potential.

Human-machine interaction and AI

The MRO 2.0 project focuses on optimizing the repair process for gas turbine blades. The team is developing automated and digitalized refurbishment process chains that enable upgrades for highly efficient gas turbines. The goal is to automate and digitalize the repair process for turbine blades. While demonstrators and systems for assessing the condition of turbine blades as well as additive repair processes were developed in the first project phase, the focus of the second project phase is on transferring the findings to deployment. In addition to the technical issues, aspects of occupational psychology, such as the acceptance of new workflows and processes, will also be examined.

In the project, the BAM team is focussing primarily on new test methods for determining the residual wall thickness and assessing near-surface damage. They make it possible to precisely analyze the condition of the used turbine blades in order to then initiate suitable repair steps. Additive manufacturing technologies are used for the repairs, with BAM developing, evaluating, and qualifying suitable processes such as wire arc additive manufacturing, in which additional material is applied in a targeted manner, for example, to replace material removed during operation.

The scientists are also developing digital twins of the entire process. With the help of AI algorithms, they continuously analyze data on the operating conditions and the behavior of the turbine blades in use. This enables them to make predictions about the remaining service life of components, proactively plan maintenance measures, and minimize downtimes.

Ten partners are involved in the project, including Siemens Energy, several Fraunhofer Institutes, and the Technical University of Berlin.

Sustainable AM for high-temperature applications

The HTA 2.0 project is developing sustainable AM processes and components for high-temperature parts in large gas turbines. It builds on the successful results of the first funding period, in which the processing of high-temperature materials for complex components was characterized using powder bed-based laser beam melting, and effective process monitoring techniques were developed. This will enable component defects to be detected during the process in the future.

In the current project, the focus is on faster and more efficient processes. The AM processes are being evaluated in the context of sustainable product development to achieve more economically and ecologically efficient component solutions for the area of high operating temperatures in gas turbines. For example, various post-processing methods for additively manufactured components are being investigated and automated as far as possible to replace the manual and time-consuming processing steps that are still required today.

A central research focus is on increasing the reusability of the starting material for additive processes and reducing material waste. To this end, recycling strategies are being developed and tested for both used powder and consolidated solid material from waste originating from faulty construction processes and support structures. In this way, high material costs and environmental pollution are to be reduced. Holistic life cycle analyses evaluate the economic and ecological effects.

The project includes eleven partners from scientific institutions, large corporations, and several SMEs. BAM is contributing its expertise in comprehensive material characterization, the AM process, process monitoring, and component inspection, as well as the determination of material behavior at high temperatures.",voxelmatters.com,news,VoxelMatters - The heart of additive manufacturing,Edward Wakefield,0.3725490196078431,448973367,1,https://www.voxelmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03-19-forschung-am-werner-von-siemens-centre-phase-zwei.jpeg,

We are slowly seeing a trend where car manufacturers are slowly shifting their focus from ICE vehicles to EVs and Hybrids. In India, we currently have several cars that are offered with both mild and strong hybrid systems. Here, we have a list of strong hybrid cars that are available for sale and also the models that are expected to launch in the future. We'll start with the models that are available for sale first.

Grand Vitara

The first car on the list is the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. This was the first-ever new product jointly developed by Suzuki with Toyota for the Indian market. It is available with both a mild hybrid and strong hybrid variant. The strong hybrid variant uses a 1.5-litre, 3-cylinder petrol engine that works alongside an electric motor. This strong hybrid system makes the Grand Vitara extremely fuel-efficient. It returns 27.97 kmpl as per ARAI. The price for the Grand Vitara Hybrid starts at Rs 18.43 lakh, ex-showroom, and goes up to Rs 20.09 lakh, ex-showroom.

Urban Cruiser Hyryder

Toyota's version of the Grand Vitara is called the Urban Cruiser Hyryder. Both these SUVs differ in terms of exterior design, but under the hood, they remain the same. The Toyota Hyryder also returns a fuel economy certified at 27.97 kmpl. The price for the Hyryder starts at Rs 18.69 lakh, ex-showroom, and Rs 20.19 lakh, ex-showroom.

Toyota Innova Hycross

Another popular MPV in the Indian market is the Innova Hycross. The current generation of the Innova features a strong hybrid system. It is powered by a 2.0-litre petrol engine paired with an electric motor. The engine generates a total of 183 Bhp and 188 Nm of peak torque. It is paired with an e-CVT gearbox as standard. The price for the Innova Hycross hybrid variant starts at Rs 25.72 lakh, ex-showroom, and goes up to Rs 30.68 lakh, ex-showroom.

Maruti Invicto

Maruti's version of the Innova Hycross is sold as the Invicto via Nexa dealerships. It is currently the flagship model in Maruti's entire lineup. The Invicto is only available with the strong hybrid engine option. It generates the same power and torque as the Innova. The price for the Invicto starts at Rs 25.30 lakh, ex-showroom, and goes up to Rs 29.02 lakh. When compared to the Innova, it misses out on some features, including ADAS.

Honda City Hybrid

Honda was the first manufacturer to offer a strong hybrid car in the mass segment. The City Hybrid is powered by a 1.5-litre Atkinson cycle engine that generates a combined power of 126 PS and 253 Nm of torque. It has a claimed fuel economy of 26.5 kmpl.

Upcoming Hybrid Cars

Other than the models mentioned above, we also have a list of cars that are expected to come with strong hybrid tech in the future.

Maruti Fronx

The Maruti Fronx is actually a beefed-up version of the Baleno. It is even called the baby Grand Vitara because of its exterior design. Maruti announced this year that the Fronx will get hybrid tech in the future. This would be different from the system that we see in the models available in our market at the moment. It will be a Series Hybrid System where the petrol engine's sole purpose is to act as a generator to produce electricity. This electricity then powers an electric motor, which in turn drives the wheels.

Maruti Swift

In a few months' time, the next-gen Swift will be launched in the market. There are reports that Maruti will be introducing strong hybrid tech in the new hatchback too. We are expecting this system to be the same as the one Maruti will offer in the Fronx.

Next-gen Dzire

The next-generation Dzire has also been spotted testing a couple of times, and it is expected that the next-gen Dzire would also be offered with strong hybrid technology.

Grand Vitara 7-Seater

Maruti will be launching a 7-seater version of the Grand Vitara SUV by 2025. It is expected to be slightly longer than the 5-seater variant. However, it will be offered with the same strong hybrid engine options as the 5-seater version.

Hyryder 7-seater

The simulations are performed by using a sequential approach where the temperature history generated during a frictional heat analysis is used as an input for the stress analysis. The frictional heat analysis is based on the Eulerian method, which requires signicantly lower computational time as compared to the Lagrangian approach. The stress analysis is performed using a temperature dependent material model both with isotropic and kinematic hardening behaviors. The results predict the presence of residual tensile stresses in circumferential direction for both hardening behaviors. These residual stresses may cause initiation of radial cracks on the disc surface after a few braking cycles. For repeated braking an approximately stable stress-strain loop is obtained already after the rst cycle for the linear kinematic hardening model. So, if the fatigue life data for the disc material is known, its fatigue life can be assessed. These results are in agreement with experimental observations available in the literature.The simulation results predict one hot band in the middle of the disc for a pad with no wear history. It is also shown that convex bending of the pad is the major cause of the contact pressure concentration in middle of the pad which results in the appearance of a hot band on the disc surface. The results also show that due to wear of the pad, dierent distributions of temperature on the disc surface are obtained for each new brake cycle and after a few braking cycles, two hot bands appear on the disc surface.This sequential approach has proved tremendously cheap in terms of computational time so it gives the freedom to perform multi-objective optimization studies. Preliminary results of such a study are also presented where the mass of the back plate, the brake energy and the maximum temperature generated on the disc surface during hard braking are optimized. The results indicate that a brake pad with lowest possible stiness will result in an optimized solution with regards to all three objectives. Another interesting result is the trend of decrease in maximum temperature with an increase in back plate thickness.Finally an overview of disc brakes and related phenomena is presented as a literature review.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.3254901960784313,448972118,1,,

There is a $1.756 million cash prize on the line just outside of Palm Springs, which is the largest purse for any race held by the series that is not the Indianapolis 500.

The Thermal Club is a unique 3.067-mile road course at the base of the Santa Rose Mountains. With 19 turns of various degree, the Twin Palms layout is set to challenge even the top drivers of the series.

The event will begin a little after noon on Sunday, with two heat races determining who advances to the ""all-star"" race. The final race will be a 12-car, 20-lap dash to see who takes home the big bucks.

It is hard to say who is a favorite in the race, given that the track and format are such unknowns to the series. Josef Newgarden has to be feeling good after winning at St. Petersburg two weeks ago, his first non-oval win since June 2022, and his first street course victory since Long Beach in April of that same season.",mlive.com,news,mlive,,0.4039215686274509,448970060,1,https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/PU4EALFGNNCVBAJOWLCOWSKNYU.jpg?auth=246fb9b3d3ec809b2bb4d09e6ade14ba48c3647bd7140a0602e6b1ccd8300b2c&width=1280&quality=90,

This length of wind blade is produced for the first time in the world.

The blades in question left the assembly chain of Sany Renewable Energy company, located in Bayannur's smart ""zero carbon"" industrial park, on Wednesday, March 21. Propellers with 131-meter blades will be installed in large-sized wind facilities producing megawatts, increasing the capacity and efficiency of wind energy production.

Sany Renewable Energy company moved from traditional manufacturing to a smart form of manufacturing and improved the precision of its products thanks to digitalized technology. It also points out the fact that these blades use convertible polyurethane compositions. This increases the recyclability of the material while mass production can be achieved.

Covering an area of 36 hectares, Bayannur smart zero carbon industrial park benefits from a total investment of approximately 1 billion yuan ($138,8 million).

""The Cloud / Studio Hybrid model provides seamless synchronization between studio- based radio software (Myriad Playout 6) and native cloud playout (Myriad Cloud),"" it stated.

""Radio shows can be broadcast directly from the studio OR from the Myriad Cloud system with further contribution from remote sources or presenters, either live or voice tracked, available regardless of where the show originates.""

It said the new Myriad Edge application offers an extra dimension to the concept by introducing a lightweight ""headless"" daemon that synchronizes content and schedule from the Cloud / Studio Hybrid but plays all content locally, even if the web connection is unavailable.

Myriad Edge also includes synchronized station Clocks and Rules, allowing it to schedule content as required in the event of a prolonged loss of internet service. Myriad Edge can be positioned in radio control rooms or at transmission sites with intermittent internet access.

The company also will be adding Myriad DR to the Hybrid range. This allows stations to maintain a ""warm"" backup of content and schedule, which is automatically synchronized in near real-time from their main broadcast site. In the event of an emergency or planned maintenance, the system can take over broadcasting duties.

Their installed capacity could reach 186 GW by the end of 2020. The cold climate sites impose the risk of ice accumulation on turbines during the winter due to the humidity at low temperatures. Since the atmospheric and operating conditions of the wind turbine leading to blade icing vary stochastically in space and time, the resulting ice accumulation is completely random, it is even different for turbines within the same site. Ice accumulation alters aerofoil shapes of the blade, affecting their aeroelastic behavior. The icing severity at different locations of the blade and their non-uniform distribution on blades have a distinct influence on turbine power output and vibrations. The current thesis proposes a methodology to investigate such behavior of wind turbines by considering the structural and aerodynamic property changes in the blade due to icing. An automated procedure is used to scale simulated/measured ice shape on aerofoil sections of the blade according to a specified ice mass distribution. The aeroelastic behavior of the blades is simulated considering the static aerodynamic coefficients of the iced aerofoil sections. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW baseline wind turbine model. The method can be leveraged to analyze the influence of icing on any wind turbine model. De/Anti-icing systems are installed on the turbines to mitigate the risks associated with icing. It is essential to detect icing at the early stage and initiate these systems to avoid production losses and limit the risks associated with ice throw. Ice accumulation increases blade mass and its spatial distribution changes natural frequencies of the blade. A detection technique is proposed in this thesis to characterize ice mass distribution on the blades based on its natural frequencies. The detection technique is validated using experiments on a small-scale cantilever beam and 1-kW wind turbine blade set-ups and its effectiveness is also verified on large-scale wind turbine blades using numerical models. The proposed technique has the potential for detecting ice masses on large wind turbines operating in cold climate as it requires only first few natural frequencies of the blade. These natural frequencies are usually excited by the turbulent wind in operation/standstill conditions and they can be estimated from the vibration measurements of the blade.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.01960784313725483,448966531,1,,eng-9420920

Notwithstanding their lasting popularity, the majority of deals are reported to be unsuccessful. Given their prevalence and practical relevance, acquisitions have attracted scholarly interest from diverse academic disciplines and traditions. Despite the extensive volume of the acquisition literature, some intriguing questions remain unanswered and some essential assumptions remain untested. This dissertation seeks to explore several of these unanswered questions: What determines ""us versus them"" type of thinking in acquisitions? What influences social preferences, willingness to learn and the type and degree of trust in acquisitions? What roles do culture, organizational identity and status play in this regard? Shall we expect differences to be problematic all the time? Could it be the case that cultural differences sometimes lead to positive perceptions and reactions among individuals involved in acquisitions? Motivated by these questions and many others, this dissertation primarily looks at the human side of acquisitions, and, in so doing, it problematizes the sociocultural dynamics during the initial phases of the post-acquisition process. Building on theories of social-psychology and utilizing experimental designs, the dissertation consists of three theoretical and three empirical papers, which address the aforementioned questions. The theoretical arguments and the empirical findings reported in this dissertation suggest that status differences between acquiring and acquired firms have discernable effects on key sociocultural integration outcomes like trust, social preferences, organizational commitment and knowledge transfer. Taken together, the arguments raised and results reported in this dissertation point out the important, yet hitherto relatively neglected, role of status in acquisitions, and in other similar inter-organizational modes.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.2941176470588236,448964469,1,,

""I wanted to pioneer an off-grid lifestyle and create a place for people to connect with nature without sacrificing comfort,"" he says.

Pawel's three handmade Mongolian yurts and log cabin, tucked away in 2.5 acres on a hill overlooking the Stavros tis Psokas valley, offer just that. We stayed in the spacious Qadan (meaning ""cliff"" in Mongolian), which sits on the edge of the property - hammock, table and chairs ready for sundowners or stargazing. Inside, there's a super-comfy wrought iron double bed, rugs, stove, coffee-making kit, Bluetooth speaker and wifi - you name your creature comfort and the attentive Pawel has thought of it.

The other two yurts, as well as Koliba, the newly built cabin, are family-friendly. Set several metres apart to afford privacy, all have outside showers and compostable loos that use a combination of sawdust and bokashi to dispose of waste. There is also one conventional loo for ""those who want to try being closer to nature,"" says Pawel, ""but don't want to compromise their comfort in the name of water conservation and keeping the aquifer clean!""

Reached by a long gravel track, Pawel's eco-retreat is the last inhabited property before entering the forested Troodos mountains 2km to the east. It feels blissfully remote, but the tiny village of Simou is nearby and it is only a 20-minute drive to the small port of Polis Chrysochou and Latchi fishing village. You can take a boat trip from here, some glass-bottomed and offering dips in the celebrated Blue Lagoon, or go for a swim on the beach before a blowout fish meze at Y&P Fish Tavern, part of the Latchi Hotel.

Pawel himself lives in the welcoming Straw House, home also to four cats and Shuki, a 10-year-old pointer cross rescue dog. ""His name comes from śukravāsaraḥ, meaning Friday in Sanskrit,"" says Pawel, ""the day our paths crossed at the local dog shelter."" Pawel will provide guests with a GPS for self-guided hikes or bike rides, but many prefer Shuki as a guide. ""He's well known for accompanying guests,"" says Pawel, who hosts yoga and pilates sessions in the pavilion beneath the house and advises on local rock-climbing, water sports and horse riding. For the latter, George's Ranch offers riding for all levels, but experienced riders can take a 90-minute sunset hack across the clifftops and sandy beaches of the Sea Caves natural caverns, stopping at Agios Georgios, a small, natural harbour in the Akamas Peninsula National Park, home to gorges, hiking trails and stunning bays, including the Blue Lagoon.

Back at the Straw House, breakfast in Pawel's kitchen includes halloumi, scrambled eggs, olives and endless coffee. He will also cook a vegetarian or vegan supper for guests (€17pp or €10pp for under 12s). Mains might include baked courgette with rosemary and garlic, served with cinnamon rice, warm bread, salad and marinated chilli, or ajapsandali, a Georgian aubergine stew served with bulgur wheat and local sheep yoghurt.

Guests help themselves to local wine or beer, nicely chilled thanks to electricity generated by solar panels and a wind turbine. Only 2-4% of energy use is generated by a back-up diesel generator and, in 2021, Pawel installed a solar-powered well pump. ""We are totally independent when it comes to water for our household, guests and our extensive irrigation system,"" he says proudly.

One day I joined Pawel on an early-morning mountain bike (four are available to hire), doing a section of a 15km loop that passes through the abandoned Turkish villages of Istinjo, Melandra, Zacharia and Sarama, a legacy of the Turkish invasion of the island. The 1974 partition of Cyprus and the uprooting of residents is brought starkly to life. The landscape takes no sides, and the beauty is uplifting. We pass the medieval stone-built Skarfos Bridge on the Evretou river. It is an ancient Venetian bridge, poppies growing on its banks, and you can spot Skarfos watermill in the near distance. Evretou reservoir, itself home to two abandoned villages, is a birder's paradise, and a good spot for fishing and foraging. You can see it on the track as you drive up to Pawel's yurts.

""I've seen mouflon on these trails,"" Pawel tells me, referring to an endangered wild sheep famed for its sickle-shaped horns and endemic only to the Troodos mountains. Sadly, we don't spot any when we visit Omodos, a village in the north-western Troodos with a lovely main square with tavernas and cafés. While it's a good starting point for hikes, unimpressed children might prefer a visit to the mouflon enclosure in the Troodos forestry station near Stavros, where 30 of these shy, endangered marvels can be seen up close.

For grownups, there are different marvels on offer in the form of the Byzantine churches throughout the Troodos region. For me, the highlight was Agios Nikolaos tis Stegis, or Church of St Nicholas of the Roof, an 11th century Byzantine monastery. This Unesco World Heritage site is 5km from the don't-miss narrow cobbled village of Kakopetria on the Karkotis river in the Troodos foothills.

This church is distinctive not only for its pitch timber roof and domed cross-in-square structure, but for its magnificent frescoes, dating from the 11th to 17th centuries, that cover every wall. Particularly notable is a rare portrayal of a breastfeeding Madonna, a magnet of which has been on my fridge ever since our visit. In my head, meanwhile, I carry the promise of a return to the hopefulness and warm welcome offered by Pawel, a man who continues to build - and share - his dream of sustainable tourism. ""It's so rewarding,"" he tells me. ""I am grateful for every visitor.""",ca.style.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!,,0.1843137254901961,448963778,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a2977be2a1e8202621a67f68b47d6ea4,

Less than a half-second separated the top seven in qualifying for the first heat race on the 17-turn, 3.067-mile road course east of Palm Springs, California.

""It's so tight I think everyone could have been on the pole,"" Rosenqvist said. ""Going into this qualifying, in a way we're supposed to feel less pressure being here because there's no points or anything, but I was actually more nervous than ever probably.

The series will hold its first exhibition event at the track in the Southern California desert.

""It felt really good just getting the lap done with such a tight field. So, yeah, it was really cool.""

With a purse of $1.756 million, the inaugural $1 Million Challenge will put IndyCar drivers in the go-for-broke situations found in many other sports' all-star games and competitions. Though all 27 drivers are guaranteed at least $23,000 for entering the event, the prize money jumps for the top five with the winner getting $500,000.

Though starting at the front of the 10-lap heat races should provide an advantage for making the Sprint for the Purse main event, no one feels comfortable. In some unusual competition twists, IndyCar won't be counting caution laps in the heats or the main event, and drivers will be allowed to use push to pass (which provides 60 extra horsepower) from the green flag.

""I'm going to put a bumper on the rear because it's going to be tight,"" Alex Palou said after winning the pole position for the second heat. ""With the push to pass being enabled on the start, and the tow, it's going to be tight.

""I think, yeah, nobody's safe. It's obviously the best spot, but it's not guaranteed. There's other races where you say, 'OK, if you're through Turn 1, it's guaranteed you're going to be pretty much top three, top five. Here I don't think it's the case.""

Here's what other drivers were saying after qualifying at The Thermal Club:

Scott McLaughlin (qualified second, first heat): ""I'm hell-bent. To have a qualifying session which was just bang, bang, bang in a shootout lap, one lap, is pretty awesome and that's effectively what that was. To do a good job there was good. Congrats to Felix (Rosenqvist). I feel like I could have had him. I just (mucked) up that last corner, but you've got to do the lap, it's pressure, and that's cool.""

Rinus VeeKay (qualified third, first heat): ""It's interesting. Just like this whole weekend, right? It's different. You've got the push-to-pass too, which usually you can focus on one thing, but now we're pressing a button on the top of the steering wheel. It felt really good. One thing about this track, with the wind and basically a sandstorm that came through, every session, maybe every outing, the car felt different. We just kind of nailed it for the conditions the way they were. A little bit surprised. Didn't feel as good as in practice, but very, very happy and great job by the guys. ... Staying on track (is the key Sunday). I think that's my thing. You only have to lead one lap and that's the last one. First got to make it through to the all-star race and then to the $1 Million Challenge, and then we look forward there. This starting position definitely makes tomorrow a little bit easier ... If I'm close enough, and I see a gap, I'll definitely go for it.""

Graham Rahal (qualified third, second heat): ""That was just an old-fashioned, pull it out, sort of thing. I just need the balance and brake locking to be consistent, and I struggled with it so much. Before the red, I went into Turn 2 and was up, on a better lap than I ended up with but lost the rear tires and lost the lap. We pulled it out, but it was nice to feel the competitiveness. And without as much overtake as others, we were still very competitive there and were able to put one in. This is a pleasant surprise for me.""

Christian Lundgaard (qualified fourth, first heat): ""It's for sure full commitment. I don't know what Santino (Ferrucci) was doing, if he was that just slow from Turn 7 and back. I knew he'd be in the way, and it was going to be a problem. I think we had at least half a tenth, but we're behind Felix, so it's a bummer, but I think we showed our true pace earlier. I've got a feeling they're looking at us as the most competitive car, so I think they should be worried. We just need to go out and have fun. We're competitive, and I'm happy. The heat races will be different strategy compared to the main race, but at the same time, you've got to take the heat race first. If you're not in the top six, you won't make it to the main race, so there are many ways to approach it, but I think the No. 45 Hy-Vee Honda will be on the right strategy.""

Josef Newgarden (qualified fifth, first heat): ""I feel solid in race running. It's a tricky surface. There's definitely going to be drop off and tire wear, but I think we're looking after the tires super well so I'm excited for race running. Got to stay out of trouble to start, and then I think our longevity should prove to be pretty competitive. It's been fun testing here and getting through a list of items and seeing if we can win some money. Chevy's done a great job. They continue to bring us great performance on the weekend. Excited to get through tomorrow, but also really excited to get back to Long Beach as well and keep proving our worth.""

Tom Blomqvist (qualified fifth, second heat): ""I'm really happy. I am slowly, but surely going in the right direction. Yesterday was really difficult for me, but we made really good steps overnight with the car. I'm just focusing on getting more comfortable every lap and learning what I need from the car to go fast.""

Will Power (qualified sixth, first heat): ""Because you have push-to-pass, it's just one lap and big (tire degradation). It's very difficult to wait two hours, then have a different condition and just go. It's tough. I did. I tried a couple of different things and made mistakes. It was hard to put all of that together. For Rosenqvist to be P1 is solid. It just depends on what you want to do (in the heat races). I don't feel like doing much damage for P6 or something. It's such a short race, anything can happen.""

Pietro Fittipaldi (qualified sixth, second heat): ""I'm disappointed because we were on a really fast lap but unfortunately, I got traffic and I had used all my push to pass and then the red flag came out. We went out again for one lap and, honestly, I thought we were done because we didn't have any push to pass left. And push to pass will gain you about seven 10ths on the lap, and we went out and finished the lap without it and ended up P6, so I'm frustrated because I know with it, we could have been somewhere in the top three, top two. The car was very, very fast. Great job to the whole team. We're evolving, and I'm happy and very thankful to the team.""

Romain Grosjean (qualified seventh, first heat): ""We knew qualifying was going to be a challenge. Very tricky conditions out there. I made a small mistake in our lap that cost us, but we are up there in the mix, so a lot of potential in the car.""

Alexander Rossi (qualified seventh, second heat): ""I really have a hard time explaining that one. I think we were three of the fastest cars through most of the past two days, so to end up seventh, eighth and ninth is a big surprise. I think it was all for different reasons. There's nothing left to say, really. It's very surprising and frustrating. I know we have good cars, so it shouldn't be hard to go forward, but we have our work cut out for us.""

Agustin Canapino (qualified eighth, first heat): ""We are in a good position. Honestly, the lap wasn't good. We didn't find the speed in the fastest corner, and we need to check what happened. But the good thing is we are in a good position for tomorrow to try and make it to the main race. I think the target is try to end better. Of course, we are starting P8 alongside my teammate Romain. We need only to advance two positions. It will be difficult of course. Many good drivers and top teams, but we had a good car, especially in practice. We were much better. For some reason, my car wasn't good in qualifying again on the faster corners, but I think we can find some speed for tomorrow.""

Callum Ilott (qualified eighth, second heat): ""That was a tough one. We had the pace all day; the No. 6 Arrow McLaren Chevrolet felt great. Unfortunately, the qualifying results didn't show that. We'll have a bit of work to do (Sunday) morning to make it into the big event, but we'll be ready to get back out there and make the most of it.""

Pato O'Ward (qualified ninth, second heat): ""This track is very sensitive to heat, wind. It was getting really gusty, especially there in the back over by the esses. There was a lot of sand on track. You could see it from the rooster tails coming out of the cars. As it was for us, it wasn't the most perfect lap for me, but I just could never get the car to set. It was always wanting to go the opposite direction of where I wanted it to go. It was a bit of a fight out there, but it seems like we're not the only ones. A lot of guys are struggling with it, and it's just really, really gusty and feels icy out there.""

""Those cars are really, really wind sensitive and I feel like we're getting a taste of that here. Maybe in Indy, where you're going so fast and the wind is a bit more of a factor. It's definitely shifted a lot. You think you have a good car, and then you're going into it and what happened to the balance? Not that if felt horrible, but it just never actually got into, I feel like, an operating window. I feel the tires never got to their sweet spot, and this qualifying session that we've with overtake, you've got one lap to do it. Once you choose your lap, you've got to stick with it. I'm glad that we tried in Lap 2, I think Callum did as well. But it seems that we're not the only ones that are struggling.""

Kyle Kirkwood (qualified 13th, first heat): ""The only damage (from a practice crash) was the rear attenuator. The car's fine, we've just been on the struggle bus. A year ago, we were the fastest thing out there. We're going to have some work to do (Sunday). Thank God it's not a points race, I'd be in tears if this was Long Beach.""",sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports,,0.2941176470588236,448963719,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i8tVn6QPYCOlt61ir_Oa.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbcsports.com/ecd9d6c4e18fea7dc26004f9e1d3666c,eng-9421043

The two companies entered a long term partnership in 2015.

Since then they jointly develop technologies for electric vehicles, connected-car technology, collaborated on advanced safety technologies, and expanded complimentary products. Job one production of Mazda's re-designed, compact, hybrid vehicle for the European market started on the 15th of January 2024 in Onnaing, France.

The self-charging Mazda2 Hybrid is the perfect car for city life: with its expressive lines, attractive proportions, and compact size, it feels right at home in an urban setting - and is ready for any outer-city adventure. The newly introduced Mazda signature design elements express a sleek and sophisticated look.

The 2024 Mazda2 Hybrid has received a new face with a true to Mazda bumper and grill design. Together with a unique rear - designed in the European Design Studio and featuring a liftgate garnish in body-colour - the setup creates a sporty look and gives the vehicle a mellow but expressive surface to showcase the craftsperson's skill. In line with other Kodo designed models, the new Mazda2 Hybrid conveys a sense of vitality while keeping a simple stability and firmness at its core.

Offering a platform with exceptionally high torsional rigidity, low centre of gravity and ideal weight distribution for reduced body roll the car is fun to drive, stable and also has a very short stopping distance. MacPhercon strut front and torsion beam rear suspension combines excellent ride comfort with enhanced agility. The NVH (Noice, Vibration and Harshness) levels are notably low and offer the occupants a quiet, refined cabin environment.

The Mazda2 Hybrid features cutting-edge intelligent hybrid technology which seamlessly transitions between electric, petrol and combination modes, giving the driver an agile and enjoyable driving experience in any situation. The compact car combines a 1490 cm³, 92 PS/68 kW three-cylinder petrol engine with a 59 kW electric motor for a total system power of 116 PS/85 kW. The 2024 hybrid accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 9.7 seconds and has a top speed of 175 km/h. It returns WLTP combined cycle fuel economy of only 4.2-3.8 l/100 km and CO2 emissions of just 97-87 g/km (wheel size-dependent).

The company is convinced that by offering a full range of sustainable technologies - ranging from battery-electric vehicles, hybrids and plug-in hybrids, to using a rotary engine as a power generator - a multi-solution strategy is an efficient and effective way to reduce emissions. With this strategy, Mazda will meet the European CO2 emission targets through to 2030 and beyond.

Mazda will further accelerate the electrification of its model range under the multisolution approach: by 2030 the company will be offering a full range of electric vehicles for the most important segments of Europe. Ultimately, Mazda aims to achieve carbon neutrality in all its operations (including product, technology, manufacturing and sales) by 2050.",avondhupress.ie,news,The Avondhu Newspaper,Seán Creedon,0.3176470588235294,448963329,1,https://cdn.avondhupress.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/19174435/2024_mazda2-hybrid_spain_still-21_highres.jpg,eng-9419351

The Meyer Shank Racing driver won the pole position for the first of two heat races to set the 12-car field for the 20-lap exhibition race with a $500,000 first prize. Less than a half-second separated the top seven in qualifying for the first heat race on the 17-turn, 3.067-mile road course east of Palm Springs, California.

""It's so tight I think everyone could have been on the pole,"" Rosenqvist said. ""Going into this qualifying, in a way we're supposed to feel less pressure being here because there's no points or anything, but I was actually more nervous than ever probably.

""It felt really good just getting the lap done with such a tight field. So, yeah, it was really cool.""

With a purse of $1.756 million, the inaugural $1 Million Challenge will put IndyCar drivers in the go-for-broke situations found in many other sports' all-star games and competitions. Though all 27 drivers are guaranteed at least $23,000 for entering the event, the prize money jumps for the top five with the winner getting $500,000.

Though starting at the front of the 10-lap heat races should provide an advantage for making the Sprint for the Purse main event, no one feels comfortable. In some unusual competition twists, IndyCar won't be counting caution laps in the heats or the main event, and drivers will be allowed to use push to pass (which provides 60 extra horsepower) from the green flag.

""I'm going to put a bumper on the rear because it's going to be tight,"" Alex Palou said after winning the pole position for the second heat. ""With the push to pass being enabled on the start, and the tow, it's going to be tight.

In a setback for the highly anticipated NISAR (NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) mission, the joint endeavour between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has hit a snag, pushing back its launch schedule with the target now shifted to late April.

Scheduled for liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre along India's southeastern coastline, the Earth-observing satellite is in its final stages of preparation.

A pivotal aspect of the mission's readiness involves applying a specialized coating to the satellite's 39-foot-diameter (12-meter) radar antenna reflector. This component, a crucial contribution from NASA, necessitates the coating to safeguard against potential temperature fluctuations that could impede its functionality in space.

Recent assessments conducted by ISRO have flagged potential temperature concerns during the reflector's stowage phase, prompting the need for this additional precaution.

The overarching goal of the Nisar mission is to transform our comprehension of Earth's surface alterations, employing microwave signals to survey nearly all terrestrial and glacial regions globally at 12-day intervals. This frequent, high-resolution monitoring promises invaluable insights into phenomena like ice sheet movements, forest dynamics, and natural calamities such as earthquakes and volcanic activities.

To address the thermal challenges, the special coating, engineered to mitigate solar radiation effects and limit temperature escalation, is currently being administered at a specialized facility in California. This intricate process involves transporting the reflector from ISRO's assembly site in India, underscoring the international collaboration integral to this mission's execution.

Once the coating's efficacy in managing thermal conditions is validated, the reflector will be repatriated to India for integration onto the satellite, marking a crucial milestone preceding the anticipated launch.

Nisar signifies the first hardware collaboration between NASA and ISRO in the realm of Earth observation missions. By melding L-band and S-band synthetic aperture radars, Nisar pledges unparalleled insights into the dynamic nature of Earth's surfaces, spanning from glacier monitoring to wetland and forest surveillance, and comprehensive observation of land adjacent to pivotal geological landmarks.",tech.hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times Tech,,0.2078431372549019,448962962,1,https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2024/03/24/1600x900/NISAR-spacecraft_1711264605653_1711264605818.png,eng-9421718

Larger and still fast main memory is needed for meeting the demand and avoiding an increase in backing store accesses that are much slower and less energy efficient than main memory accesses. Luckily, Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies can bridge the cost, density, performance, and energy efficiency gaps between backing store and DRAM, the conventional main memory technology. Thus, NVM can be combined with DRAM into hybrid main memory striving to enjoy both the larger capacity enabled by NVM and the speed and energy efficiency of DRAM. NVM adds a new dimension to the system design space inspiring researchers to investigate sophisticated hybrid memories. This has resulted in a large body of work that, unfortunately, lacks systematization. The thesis at hand addresses this problem by proposing a taxonomy and a notation for classifying hybrid main memory organizations. The design space of hybrid systems is large, and the best partitioning of resources between DRAM and NVM is nontrivial. The high implementation and computation efforts of detailed modeling impede extensive design space exploration required for finding the most promising design points. This thesis aids such extensive exploration by proposing a workload methodology and first-order models for system-level execution time and energy. Next, the thesis contributes with Rock, an insightful performance model showing how memory system throughput can be boosted by installing more DRAM and NVM thus motivating Design-time Resource Partitioning (DRP). The lack of an approach suitable for extensive partitioning is addressed by proposing Crystal, a DRP method powered by the system-level models and framing partitioning as an optimization problem, such that the first-order nature of the models does not restrict its applicability, as shown by validation.

Long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging, enabling vision in darkness, smoke, and fog, traditionally employs bulky refractive lenses made from costly materials like germanium, hindering widespread use.

Recent advancements propose a solution through meta-optics, leveraging engineered metasurfaces composed of nanopillar arrays. These metasurfaces introduce controlled phase shifts to manipulate light, achieving results comparable to conventional optics but with reduced thickness.

Despite the promise, challenges like chromatic aberrations persist, especially in LWIR applications. Addressing this, researchers at the University of Washington introduced ""MTF-engineering,"" a novel design framework optimizing modulation transfer function (MTF) to maintain image contrast across spatial frequencies.

Led by Associate Professor Arka Majumdar, the team employs inverse design techniques and deep neural networks (DNNs) to expedite meta-optic design. By optimizing pillar shape and arrangement, they achieve rapid optimization of large-area optics. Their intuitive figure of merit (FoM), related to the MTF curve's area, ensures optimal information transmission through the lens, enhancing image quality.

Fabricating their design from a single silicon wafer, the team's germanium-free LWIR imaging system represents progress towards commercialization. They've also democratized their MTF-engineering framework, ""metabox,"" freely available on GitHub, empowering global researchers to design meta-optics.

""The figure of merit is related to the area under the MTF curve,"" Majumdar explained in a statement. ""The idea here is to pass as much information as possible through the lens, which is captured in the MTF. Then, combined with a light computational backend, we can achieve a high-quality image.""

This research extends beyond the laboratory, impacting industries reliant on imaging technologies. The lightweight, high-performance meta-optic systems promise enhanced capabilities in consumer electronics, national security, and other sectors. By offering their framework as open-access, the team fosters collaboration and innovation in meta-optic design worldwide.

Meta-optics present a promising solution to the challenges of traditional LWIR imaging systems, offering improved performance in a lightweight form. The MTF-engineering framework developed by the University of Washington researchers facilitates rapid optimization and enhances image quality, driving advancements in optical systems across various applications.",wonderfulengineering.com,news,Wonderful Engineering,,0.1686274509803922,448956931,1,https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-converter-29.jpg,

(Yonhap)

Korean Air Chair and CEO Walter Cho secured his position as a board member of the national flag carrier and pledged to steer the company toward successful integration with Asiana Airlines this year, marking a leap toward establishing a megacarrier.

Cho received an 85 percent endorsement from participating shareholders during their annual meeting on Thursday.

""Despite the prolonged timeline, the merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines will be a substantial driver of long-term growth,"" Cho said in a written statement to shareholders on Thursday. ""The ongoing business review for the acquisition of Asiana Airlines gained approval from Japan in January and the EU in February, with only the US' review pending. Our company is diligently preparing to expedite the review process and ensure a successful integration with Asiana Airlines.""

Despite the divestment of Asiana Airlines' cargo freighter business and the transfer of specific European routes on the way to comply with the EU's conditional approval, the industry foresees that the merger will propel the company to the list of the global top 10 air carriers.

Korean Air also aims to resolve concerns over potential route monopolies raised by the US Department of Justice through consultations by June, seeking approval within the year.

Meanwhile, a day prior to the shareholders' meeting, Cho convened a face-to-face town hall gathering where he openly engaged with Korean Air employees and addressed their concerns.

According to industry sources, the meeting was held at the Korean Air headquarters, where approximately 100 employees voluntarily participated and reportedly queried Cho on various aspects of the impending merger.

In response, the chair assured them of the company's commitment to securing favorable outcomes from US regulation authorities, which is regarded the final hurdle in the process.

Cho also emphasized that Korean Air executives would actively integrate with Asiana Airlines post-merger in a manner that respects both companies' cultures, given their historical rivalry.

In response to concerns about possible workforce redundancies after the merger of the two airlines, he voiced confidence in the necessity of increasing humanpower across all sectors to uphold service quality and meet customer satisfaction standards.

Following the shareholders meeting Thursday, Korean Air announced the signing of a significant contract with Airbus for the acquisition of 33 cutting-edge A350 airplanes.

The deal, valued at some $13.7 billion, comprises 27 A350-1000s and six A350-900s, marking a strategic move to bolster the airline's long-term fleet operations while gradually phasing out older Korean Air aircraft.

The A350-1000, the largest variant in the A350 family, offers a seating capacity of up to 410 passengers in its standard three-class configuration.

Leveraging advanced composite materials, the aircraft can achieve up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to similarly sized predecessors.

With capabilities tailored for long-haul routes such as Incheon-New York, the new aircraft is to bolster Korean Air's operational efficiency and service quality.

Korean Air announced that the procurement of the A350s is part of the airline's commitment to sustainability initiatives and serves as the groundwork for a seamless integration of Asiana Airlines.

In addition to securing 33 A350s, Korean Air has outlined plans to introduce 50 Airbus A321neos, 10 Boeing 787-9s, 20 Boeing 787-10s and 30 Boeing 737-8s.",koreaherald.com,news,The Korea Herald,Kim Hae-yeon,0.3803921568627451,448956752,1,https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/03/24/20240324050130_0.jpg?1,eng-9413845

""We have to understand these people are running and nobody runs from good. Nobody wants to leave the comfort of their home and go into the unknown where you don't know if you will be welcomed.""

Getting people to understand and accept each other was just one of the reasons Jones and Women co-founder Jayme Hoyte started the NGO and continued to provide training for both migrants and locals.

Jones said she and Hoyte had been working with women separately, but decided to combine their expertise and passion to take their work to another level.

When they formed Women during the pandemic, the aim was empowerment, equity, to build the capacity of women so they became self-reliant, and other similar ideals.

They registered the NGO in 2022.

""But we decided it could not just be about the women without the input of men. We need them alongside us. So we need to sensitise the males with the struggles that women go through, we need to show them we really need them in a different capacity, we need them as support.""

Women's latest programme was Flourish - Empowering Resilience and Integration, sponsored by the International Organisation for Migrants. It is an integration programme bringing together migrants and residents of local communities.

""The main objective is to promote integration at community levels. We are doing so through skill-building, having both migrants and locals learn and work together.""

Every Saturday from March 2-April 1, ten migrant females and ten local females, and five migrant males and five local males participate in the skill programmes in sewing and hydroponics. But there were also entrepreneurship and financial-literacy workshops, as well as integration and xenophobia workshops.

""We want to educate both populations as to what is xenophobia and break down the stigma. Some people make xenophobic statements and have xenophobic behaviour and they don't even know, feeling like they are being nice to people. In this programme we try to teach people how to deal with it and break those barriers.""

Jones said Women chose to host the programme in Enterprise, Chaguanas, as there was a heavy presence of migrants in central Trinidad. And, at the end of Flourish, a community day will be hosted in Longdenville, Chaguanas, on April 1, complete with games, vendors and live entertainment, including tassa and parang, all with the idea of promoting integration.

Jones, originally from Cuba, is a citizen of Grenada and has lived in TT since 2005.

She said when she arrived, she was not classified as a migrant in people's eyes, because she arrived legally, on a plane, and was not in desperate straits. Although she did not experience the rejection, disrespect and violation she had seen and heard other Latin American women suffer, she said she had to adapt to the culture and adjust some of her behaviours and habits.

Therefore, the Spanish-speaking community was dear to her even though she considers herself an honorary Trinidadian. To her, TT was home and she had no intention of leaving. And, like her, Venezuelans just wanted to live in peace and harmony.

""Being a foreigner and also being from the Spanish community, which is the community that (has made an) exodus into Trinidad lately, it really concerned me to see some of our fellow Spanish-speaking people being attacked, especially the women.

""Yes, there are the good, the bad and the ugly, but those that we are working with, and others, are real entrepreneurs. They really came to make a difference for their families, contribute to TT and blend into the culture like the Indian, Chinese and Syrian communities that have established themselves here.""

She said over the years many Venezuelan women reached out to Women for help and some of their stories were difficult to hear. But many were talented, so the organisation taught them how to penetrate the market in TT and put them in contact with local female entrepreneurs.

""I believe that we together can make a difference. We, as visitors, have to adapt into the culture. How better to do that than by interacting with locals so that we can understand each other?""

Venezuelan Maria Requena, a Flourish participant, agreed, saying mixing the participants was an excellent idea, as it allowed her and other migrants to learn from their host community and the community to learn from them, it helped her to make new friends and she was learning more English.

She was taking the sewing workshop, and told Sunday Newsday she always wanted to learn how to sew, to make clothes for herself and her children. So when she saw the Flourish programme advertised on Women's Facebook and Instagram pages, she immediately registered, and was very happy to be chosen.

""I came to learn and put it in practice. First I want to use my new skills personally, but as long as the opportunity arises, I will expand it into a business.""

Local participant Marielle Dos Santos registered for the hydroponics programme. She said she had some decorative plants at her home in Chaguanas that were not surviving, and wanted to know what she was doing wrong. She also wanted to create a kitchen garden and liked the idea of growing plants without soil. So when her friend told her about the programme, she researched the topic and decided to register.

In addition to learning about plants, she was learning about her fellow participants.

""I realise the Venezuelans like to work first before they do anything else, but they're a lot like us. They are picking up our culture and habits. And it's also fun because it's testing my CXC Spanish.""

Cleider Brito from Tucupita, Venezuela, and for the past five years, Cunupia, said he knew about hydroponics before the programme, so when a friend sent him the link to register, he was immediately interested.

He said he liked the hydroponics system and planned to set one up here on a small scale and, at some point, a larger system in Venezuela.

""First I want to start a small business, because I'm in a country where I can't do things like I would have in Venezuela. In Venezuela I could have had my own space and not have to pay rent. I would have started big one time.

""Here it would all depend on the size of the space I get and the person I rent from before I could start selling.""

He said he never had an experience of xenophobia in TT, but the information was good to know and the interaction would hopefully help him improve his English.

Iana Edwards of Chaguanas started the sewing programme because her sister had a small sewing business with which she assisted in a limited capacity. She said she did not know how to use a sewing machine and wanted to learn so she could be of more help to her sister, as well as eventually establish her own business.

""I could maybe make some clothes for my children, sew a little bedsheet or curtain, instead of going to buy them ready-made. You could never tell in life: I could have a little small business.""

She said she had heard negative stories about migrants over the years but never let those stories colour her perception of Venezuelans, who, like everyone else, had their own stories.

""I think if we come together as a community we could change the mindset of others.""

Jones said she would like to take the Flourish programme to other communities in the future and hoped Women would get sponsors to help make that a reality.",newsday.co.tt,news,Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,Janelle De Souza,0.2549019607843137,448953947,1,https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manual-Watermark-1080-×-1180px-1418-x-742-px-20-1024x536.png,

Mitsubishi Motors is also a pioneer in electric vehicle innovation - especially hybrid EVs. The company launched the i-MiEV - the world's first mass-produced electric vehicle in 2009, followed by the Outlander PHEV - the world's first plug-in hybrid electric SUV in 2013.

On 01 February 2024, Mitsubishi announced the global debut of new hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) models of the Xpander and Xpander Cross crossover MPVs. The HEV models are produced at the Laem Chabang Plant of Mitsubishi Motors in Thailand, and will go on sale shortly.

The Xpander, launched in 2017, is a crossover MPV which combines the comfort and versatility of an MPV with the bold styling and road performance of an SUV. The Xpander Cross, launched in 2019, is the top variant on the series. The Xpander series sold over 130,000 units globally in 2022.

The HEV models combine Mitsubishi Motors' trademark electrification and all-wheel control technologies to raise the appeal of the Xpander series to another level. Newly developed based on the brand's plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), the HEV system delivers a uniquely eco-friendly and exhilarating driving experience.

At its core, the newly developed system features EV driving, hybrid driving and regenerative braking, working together to deliver high fuel efficiency and an exhilarating drive by automatically switching to the most optimal driving mode based on driving conditions and battery charge level.

Powered by the best of all worlds

When starting and at low speeds, the vehicle's electric motor is powered by the drive battery alone. When driving uphill or accelerating, the system switches to hybrid driving powered by electricity generated by the engine as well as the drive battery. When driving at high speeds, hybrid driving uses the engine with assistance from the electric motor. During deceleration, kinetic energy is recovered via regenerative braking and converted into electric power, which is then stored in the drive battery.

This HEV system makes it possible to enjoy the quiet, clean ride of an EV with no fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for short drives, and switch to the convenient, comfortable ride of an HEV for long drives without anxiety about battery charge.

The new HEV system combines a generator and a motor with a maximum output of 85 kW, with a 1.6L gasoline engine, as well as a dedicated drive battery developed specifically for the Xpander HEV. This allows torque to kicks in swiftly when starting and accelerating, helping drivers smoothly change lanes on highways and merge after U-turns on city streets.

The newly developed 1.6 L DOHC 16-valve MIVEC4 engine adopts a high expansion ratio cycle (Atkinson cycle) to achieve better fuel combustion efficiency while also incorporating the first ever electric water pump in a Mitsubishi engine to reduce mechanical loss. Overall, this improves fuel economy by around 10% compared to CVT models while also improving the fuel consumption by approximately 34% in urban driving according to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test, and approximately 15% in urban and extra-urban driving combined.

For instance, it's called the $1 Million Challenge even though the winner will only get a half million bucks. Hey, it's better marketing. The Challenge is being held at a very nice club racing track called The Thermal Club about 30 miles east of Palm Springs. Indycar held a test session here a year ago last February, and everything went so well that they're back again this year and decided to tack on a race after testing.

The track is so small and tight, and the surface so abrasive to tires, that officials decided to split everything up into two heat races Sunday morning. The top six finishers of those two heat races qualify for the main event after that. Saturday was qualifying for the heat races, and that's what Palou and Rosenqvist each won.

It wasn't easy.

With a rainstorm pelting the greater Southern California area a hundred miles to the west, that meant lots of wind blasting into the Palm Springs area. With wind in the desert, you get sand picked up. With sand comes something out of an old Hollywood Bible movie - think the Ten Commandments, Exodus, or Lawrence of Arabia.

""We were getting blasted by what appeared to be a giant haboob in the golf cart,"" said commentator and former racer Townsend Bell, referring to the desert wind named for the Arabic word for ""blasting"" or ""drifting.""

""It's so wind-dependent,"" said Graham Rahal of the track conditions. Rahal qualified third in the second group. ""Wind on the side of the car is terrible, but then getting the power down in all the hairpins is awful.""

""It's so tricky out there, man,"" said Rosenqvist. ""The wind is changing, there's dust on the track.""

""One thing about this track, with basically a sandstorm that just came through, every outing the car felt different,"" said Rinus Veekay, who qualified third in the first session. ""We just kind of nailed it.""

So then what's the key to winning this event?

""Stay on the track,"" he said. ""You only gotta lead one lap that's the last one.""

The track is so small and tight, and the surface so abrasive to tires, that officials decided to split everything up into two heat races Sunday morning. The top six finishers of those two heat races qualify for the main event after that. Saturday was qualifying for the heat races, and that's what Palou and Rosenqvist each won.

It wasn't easy.

With a rainstorm pelting the greater Southern California area a hundred miles to the west, that meant lots of wind blasting into the Palm Springs area. With wind in the desert, you get sand picked up. With sand comes something out of an old Hollywood Bible movie - think the Ten Commandments, Exodus, or Lawrence of Arabia.

""We were getting blasted by what appeared to be a giant haboob in the golf cart,"" said commentator and former racer Townsend Bell, referring to the desert wind named for the Arabic word for ""blasting"" or ""drifting.""

""It's so wind-dependent,"" said Graham Rahal of the track conditions. Rahal qualified third in the second group. ""Wind on the side of the car is terrible, but then getting the power down in all the hairpins is awful.""

""It's so tricky out there, man,"" said Rosenqvist. ""The wind is changing, there's dust on the track.""

""One thing about this track, with basically a sandstorm that just came through, every outing the car felt different,"" said Rinus Veekay, who qualified third in the first session. ""We just kind of nailed it.""

So then what's the key to winning this event?

""Stay on the track,"" he said. ""You only gotta lead one lap that's the last one.""

The EV transition is well under way, but the pace of change differs from one carmaker to another. Polestar and Tesla offer only electric cars, and other makers such as Ford, Nissan, Peugeot, Jeep and Mercedes plan to be all-electric by 2030. In contrast, Honda will continue production of petrol and diesel cars until 2040.

But Suzuki is somewhat of an outlier and doesn't plan to launch an electric car until next year. Likely to be the eVX, it will be powered by a 60kWh battery pack with a promised range of more than 550km. An entry level 48kWh version with 400km range will also be offered with front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options.

Interacting with people at the Iftar party hosted by Suriya Begum DDC Member at Badori-Smailpur in Samba district, Sadhotra said that secularism serves as a guiding principle, ensuring that every individual is treated equally, irrespective of their religion, ethnicity, or culture, which has remained the guiding philosophy of National Conference.

It underscores the importance of mutual respect and understanding among different religious communities, cultivating a sense of inclusivity and tolerance within society, he said, adding that all efforts must be made to strengthen the secular fabric of the region like Jammu and Kashmir, which has a glorious pluralistic ethos.

""Jammu and Kashmir has all along fought the forces which have been trying to create communal disharmony or promote divisiveness"", Sadhotra said and added that the land of Sufis and saints has all along played a crucial role as a unifier and shown political will in maintaining high traditions of amity and brotherhood, even during most testing times.

He exuded confidence that the people at large will appreciate the importance of coming together for harmonious growth.

""The youth have an important role in becoming the catalysts of change. The first and foremost challenge would be to pursue the agenda of inclusivity single-mindedly and at the same time forging amity between various regions, sub-regions and communities of J&K which has to be ensured at all costs"", he maintained.

Cautioning against the machinations of elements inimical to inclusiveness, Sadhotra said the people under the banner of National Conference will foil all their attempts to divide the society.

He greeted the people on the holy month of Ramadan and prayed for peace and harmony in Jammu and Kashmir.

Two weeks after the 2024 IndyCar season began on the streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, the series is set to be back in action this Sunday, but not with one of the 17 championship races on this year's schedule.

The series is set to run an exhibition race at the 20-turn, 3.067-mile (4.936-kilometer) Thermal Club road course, which is located at a 300-acre private country club in Thermal, California. The event is designed as a ""made for TV"" all-star race and is officially dubbed the $1 Million Challenge.

The venue hosted the IndyCar preseason test last year, and while the event is not a points event, something the series hasn't run since 2008 at Surfers Paradise, it is set to pay the largest purse for an IndyCar race outside of the annual Indy 500.

There are set to be two eight-minute qualifying groups on Saturday to determine the starting lineups for the two heat races on Sunday. The qualifying groups were determined by a random draw on Thursday.

The heat races, which are first for the series since 2013 at Iowa Speedway, are set to either be 10 laps or 20 minutes long, whichever comes first. While laps under caution won't count toward the lap total, the time spent under caution will count against the clock.

The top six drivers from each heat race advance to the main event. The heat race winner with the faster qualifying time is set to start on the pole position, with the other five drivers who transfer from his heat lining up in the odd starting positions. The other heat race winner is set to start on the front row in second place, with the other five drivers who transfer from his heat lining up in the event starting positions.

As for the main event itself, it is a 20-lap race featuring two 10-lap sprints, with a break for fuel, tire changes, and wing adjustments scheduled in between.

Red flag laws basically let someone like police, family members, or medical professionals bring a claim to an emergency court alleging that a person is mentally unwell and is a danger to themselves or others.

Army Gen. Randy George discussed some of the advancements this morning when talking with Defense One digital media platform in Washington.

""We've all seen how the battlefield is changing, [and] we know that you can't have these big C2 [command and control] nodes that are out there,"" George said. ""We know that machines can do a lot of things right now much more effectively and much cheaper, and we're going to have to incorporate them into our formations.""

George spoke to Defense One after having just returned from observing Project Convergence Capstone 4, an experiment involving the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Space Force. Dubbed PC-C4, the two-phase, joint and multination experiment took place at Camp Pendleton, California, and the Army's National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, from Feb. 23 through March 20.

Led by Army Futures Command, Project Convergence is a series of experiments that gives warfighters the opportunity to experiment with technology at the operational level and further refine methods for synchronizing as a joint force.

""Technology is moving really fast,"" said George, ""and [PC-C4] kind of gave us an opportunity to see just how we could do that.""

As an example of how advanced technology can be integrated into the Army's formations, George explained that he got to observe a light infantry company that was operating in a simulated urban environment while incorporating robotic dogs and unmanned aircraft systems to sense the environment.

""That was all tied together by a very simple command and control network that was easy to use and intuitive,"" said George. ""It was amazing.""

George said that the hands-on approach to innovation during experiments like PC-C4 can be very advantageous when compared to more conventional, top-down innovation.

""I think there's nothing like testing ... in the environments that you know you're going to need to operate in; this isn't about testing something in a showroom,"" remarked the general. ""This is actually getting to use [the technology] where they're going to use it ... and I think that's where we do our best learning.""

In terms of a timeline for integration of modernization capabilities, George said that depends on future budgets, and while there is no specific date or timeline for all modernization, the Army is focused on ""incremental improvement.""

""We do have a sense of urgency,"" he said. ""I think everybody is anxious to transform.""",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,,0.2470588235294118,448933261,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/b-119.jpg,

Throughout its history, the 911 has been gas-powered only, being one of the last Porsche models available not to be electrified to some extent. However, this is all about to change, with the long-time rumored hybrid version of the 911 revealed this summer.

Each time a new 911 variant is revealed, it's safe to say that a new experience will be delivered, with the 911 Hybrid expected to be no different. Porsche's shift to electrification with its current lineup came back in 2010 with the Cayenne, which has now expanded to models such as the Panamera, Macan, and the all-electric Taycan. Still, the 911 is expected to follow a different path regarding its technology. While information is still limited, here's what we know about the upcoming reveal of the new Porsche 911 Hybrid.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Porsche's manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including CarBuzz and Autocar.

The 911 Hybrid Won't Be A PHEV

Close

Regarding the upcoming 911's hybrid powertrain, the flagship sports car for the Stuttgart-based brand will be taking a different route as to how it will introduce electric power. The mentioned models, including the Panamera and Cayenne, feature a plug-in hybrid system, whereas the Macan is offered even as a pure BEV like the Taycan. However, for the 911, Porsche CEO Oliver Blume announced that the sports car won't be a PHEV. Instead, it will come with a mild-hybrid system.

Models such as the Panamera and Cayenne work perfectly as plug-in hybrids due to the massive efficiency benefits they bring. However, the 911 is designed for the sole purpose of delivering the most memorable driving experience, leading Porsche to look to alternative methods to extract the most performance out of the car through electric power. Because of this, attention was turned to motorsport's application of mild-hybrid technology.

A Look At The Hybrid Powertrains In Motorsport

Hybrid powertrains have become the norm for a select few four-wheel motorsport disciplines, with the two highest-level categories in Formula One and the LMDh Endurance class seeing tremendous benefits from their mild-hybrid technology.

Of course, the racecars in these categories are designed for one thing only, to be as fast as possible. With Blume mentioning that the 911 Hybrid's powertrain will be inspired by motorsport, this new entry into the iconic sports car's lineup could be something exceptional.

Although Porsche doesn't compete in the Formula One Championship, they do compete in WEC and IMSA, with two LMDh hypercars racing for Porsche Penske Motorsport (WEC and IMSA and two more racing for customer competitor Hertz Team Jota (solely WEC). Instead of being PHEVs, LMDh cars feature both a combustion engine and an electric motor, with the motor being powered by kinetic energy created mainly through braking to improve acceleration and overall performance.

This layout is what's expected to feature in the upcoming 911 Hybrid, with a modified version of Porsche's famous 3.0-liter flat-six engine powering the rear wheels, a 400-volt electric motor, and a 2.0-liter kWh lithium-ion battery pack being implemented for the front axle. The 3.0-liter flat-six engine will reportedly be the same spec as what's found in the Carrera, which in 2024 produced a total of 443 horsepower. However, in 2025, the power output is expected to be increased.

In addition to using methods similar to motorsport hybrid systems, such as harvesting energy through braking, the system will use the engine as its own generator. If the 911 Hybrid uses the same, or even similar, technology as the WEC Hypercars, the performance of the current 911 992 models could easily be eclipsed.

Assistance From Rimac

For the new 911 Hybrid, Porsche reportedly collaborated with Rimac Automobili to develop the best electric motor possible. This partnership between the two manufacturers makes perfect sense, as Porsche currently owns 22-percent of the Rimac Group.

In the world of all-electric performance cars, the Rimac Nevera holds the title for the fastest EV in the world, making the idea of the manufacturer assisting with the new 911's powertrain all the more compelling.

Part Of The Mid-Life 911 Refresh

Along with additional 911 models, the upcoming 911 Hybrid will usher in a new wave of sports for the 992 generation, being named the 992.2 instead. The 992 generation, which is the eighth in total, was released in 2019 and has seen many different variations in a short space of time. This includes the GT3/GT3 RS, the Targa, the Turbo/ Turbo S, and the Carrera. In addition to introducing a new hybrid version, each new 992.2 model will also receive updates.

What Changes Will The Facelift 992.2 Bring?

Overall, the 911 992.2 update will retain the same overall shape as the existing 992, but almost every soft part will be updated for 2025. For the front end, multiple different designs have been spotted on prototype cars testing on the road. Higher trims are expected to feature an aggressive aero-focused design, while lower trims will keep things more understated. Towards the rear of the car, the design most likely won't see any significant changes.

As with most facelifts, Porsche will introduce all-new wheel designs, but it's currently unclear which designs each 911 variant will receive. The single- and double-trim-specific exhaust configurations are also expected to return, along with revised lighting. Still, we'll likely have to wait until the official reveal of the 911 992.2 to know what features the 911 Hybrid will be available with.

Porsche's Future Plans For Electrification

With the first hybrid version of the 911 expected to be on sale later this year, Porsche will begin its next phase of electrification for the sports car using the 2025 model. A model 911 model that isn't newly available anymore is the mighty GT2 RS, which was discontinued after the 2019 model year.

However, Porsche has announced that the performance nameplate will be re-introduced, with the new GT2 RS slated to be unveiled in 2026. This time around, the model will also feature a mild-hybrid, once again being inspired by Porsche Penske Motorsport's 963 LMDh endurance racer.

An Electric Porsche 911?

As for an all-electric Porsche 911, the manufacturer doesn't plan to switch the sports car to an EV until at least the next decade. Porsche expects up to 80% of its fleet to be fully electric, with the expanse of the Taycan range and the introduction of the all-electric Macan being key models to hit this target.

The next generation of the 718 Boxster and Cayman models will also be going electric, but Porsche is determined to retain the 911's combustion engine for as long as possible to keep the one-of-a-kind experience alive.

While details about the summer reveal for the hybrid-led 911 992.2 are still quite limited up to this point, the unique nature of the said hybrid powertrain is guaranteed to introduce us to an even better Porsche 911 experience, setting the stage for what potential electric power has in store for the high-performance sports car.",topspeed.com,news,Top Speed,Jack O,0.1450980392156862,448931694,1,https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/porsche-911-turbo-s.jpg,

(Michael Clements/The Epoch Times)

The Biden administration is setting up a national center to provide training and technical assistance to help police, prosecutors, judges, and others implement ""red flags"" laws more effectively to take away guns from Americans ""who pose a threat to themselves or others,"" drawing criticism from some conservatives.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on March 23 that it had launched the National Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) Resource Center, a training and technical assistance hub that it says is meant to support states and localities in the implementation of their ERPO or red flag laws, which have long been controversial.

Red flag laws basically let someone like police, family members, or medical professionals bring a claim to an emergency court alleging that a person is mentally unwell and is a danger to themselves or others. If the court accepts the claim, that individual can then be ""flagged"" and prevented from buying firearms and allows the police to seize any guns in their possession.

Advocates of these types of laws, which have been implemented in a number of states, argue they're needed to keep firearms out of the hands of people who are potentially dangerous.

""The launch of the National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center will provide our partners across the country with valuable resources to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a March 23 statement.

Critics argue that these laws deny gun owners their Second Amendment rights without due process.

""Merrick Garland just announced a massive Red Flag Operation that the DOJ will be running by using EVERY spy tool the US government has in order to violate American's Second Amendment!!"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said in a post on X, in which she called the Justice Department under President Joe Biden ""weaponized.""

As of March 2024, 21 states and the District of Columbia have enacted red flag laws.

Even though ERPOs are civil orders as opposed to criminal ones, violating such an order could be a criminal offense.

Vice President Kamala Harris boasted in a post on X that the Biden administration had ""invested"" $750 million in taxpayer dollars to help implement red flag laws.

""Today, I am calling on every state to take action, and we are launching a national red flag resource center to assist,"" she wrote in the post, which drew a flurry of critical reactions from other users, ranging from calls for states to ban red flag laws to charges that they're unconstitutional.

The DOJ says that the new centralized red flag hub will provide training and technical assistance to law enforcement officials, prosecutors, attorneys, judges, clinicians, victim service and social service providers, community organizations, and behavioral health professionals -- in short, those who are responsible for implementing red flag laws in their states or cities.

""Supporting our law enforcement and community partners in curbing the scourge of gun violence is more critical than ever,"" Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement.

The red flag center is being established in collaboration with the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions (CGVS), an organization that ""grounds our work in equit"" and seeks to ""address gun violence as an epidemic-level public health emergency"" which ""disproportionately impacts communities of color.""

The red flag center and its newly launched website seek to provide law enforcement and other groups responsible for ERPO implementation ""direct access to critical information that will enhance their ability to reduce firearm homicides and suicides.""

The website also provides a platform for the red flag center to highlight new ways and strategies to implement ERPOs more effectively.

The announcement of the red flag center drew immediate criticism from some lawmakers, Second Amendment advocates, and others.

Conservative political activist Laura Loomer said in a post on X that she believes the new program would be used to target Trump supporters.

""Oh look. The DOJ just created a program to red flag Trump supporters at the same time they are allowing for illegals to have guns,"" she wrote. ""We all know this will only be used against Trump supporters, so let's just call it what it is. A red flag database to disarm MAGA. Communism.""

Former U.S. Army Ranger and current firearms attorney Ryan Cleckner called red flag laws ""horrible"" in a post on X, in which he shared a graphic titled ""How Red Flag Laws Kill Peaceable People,"" showing how heavy-handed implementation of such laws can lead to tragic outcomes.

The graphic, developed by the Firearms Policy Coalition, shows a hypothetical set of events starting from a gun owner named ""Randy"" posting a harmless photo of himself and his son at a gun range, triggering ""Karen"" who after seeing the post calls local state agents to report ""suspicions that Randy might be a risk to the community.""

Then ""biased state agents"" use red flag powers to claim that Randy is a dangerous threat, raising the matter with a local court, which determines it's acceptable to confiscate Randy's guns, leading to a middle-of-the-night police raid that ends tragically.

""Randy is awakened at 3 am by loud crashing noises, flash bangs, and death threats while his wife and son scream in terror,"" a caption in the graphic reads.

""Randy is murdered while instinctively trying to protect his family,"" it continues.

The National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) has alleged that red flag laws can easily be abused by biased officials.

""Aside from allowing run-of-the-mill malicious actors to indulge personal grudges against law-abiding gun owners, in the current politically-charged environment these laws enable the government to target those with First Amendment-protected political views the government disfavors,"" the group wrote in a note.

By contrast, the Biden administration has been a vocal advocate of tighter gun control legislation, including red flag laws, as well as centralized efforts in this regard.

For instance, President Joe Biden in September 2021 announced the creation of a White House office of ""gun violence"" prevention to ""centralize, accelerate, and intensify"" the administration's efforts to reduce acts of violence carried out with the use of firearms.

While four hours of testing were scheduled throughout the day, drivers were only able to take advantage of approximately three hours on account of a couple unexpected situations that delayed running.

The first stoppage came just 15 minutes after the green flag waved, and was caused by pieces of the track breaking apart on the exit of Turn 5.

Many drivers had been running wide over the exit curbs, and part of the asphalt just outside of the track line began to break apart and fly into the air from the forces the open wheel cars put through the track.

A red flag was thrown immediately, and the track safety crew spent the next 50 minutes filling the hole with a fast-setting epoxy, which seemed to hold up well for the rest of the day.

An extra 15 minutes were allotted to help make up for the lost time, but the day's busy schedule did not allow more added time than that.

Later in the afternoon, the final test session was delayed by five minutes due to an exceptional gust of wind that blew across the course.

Sand and dust were thick enough for a few minutes that visibility dropped to dangerous levels, but the gusts settled just enough a short time later to allow the remainder of the test session to continue.

The wind continued to affect drivers significantly, however, and many drivers ran long into the runoff areas as they pushed the limits in the afternoon.

Overall, 2,335 laps were completed across approximately eight hours of running on Friday and Saturday, giving each team plenty of data to sort through as they make plans for the rest of the season.

Christian Lundgaard set the fastest time of the weekend on Saturday, completing a lap of the 3.067-mile course in 1 minute 38.2199 seconds during the late afternoon session.

Will Power and Scott McLaughlin were second and third fastest respectively, each also setting times in the latter half of the second day.

Drivers were allowed to use their Push to Pass systems during the afternoon session, which simulated what they will have available for the qualifying runs later in the evening.

With 40 seconds of the boost available per lap, everyone could essentially use the extra power down each and every straight on the winding course.

That extra power combined with a track that was taking on more Firestone rubber and cooler track conditions helped to allow the times to continue to fall as the day progressed.

The fastest times of the weekend may still be to come, however, as qualifying is scheduled to take place when the sun is quite low in the sky.

Two short qualifying runs will take place at 5:00 PM local time, 8:00 PM Eastern, followed by two heat races and the $1 Million Challenge on Sunday.",motorsportweek.com,news,Motorsport Week,,0.02745098039215677,448928506,1,https://www.motorsportweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-03_40.jpg,

Those parts include a traditional gas engine, a standard 12-volt battery, an electric motor/generator, a hybrid EV battery, a computer system, and a series of high-voltage cables and relays. When you press the start button in a Prius, a standard 12-volt battery sends power to the vehicle's computer. The computer then runs a series of quick tests to confirm all systems are working correctly before triggering the system's central relays. The relays, in turn, actuate the hybrid EV battery, allowing power to reach both the gas engine and the electric motor.

That's a simplified version of what goes on under the hood and under your seats when you start your Prius. Now, let's dive into the technical details and further explore how these systems work together.",slashgear.com,news,SlashGear,,0.09019607843137245,448927280,1,https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/heres-how-a-toyota-prius-hybrid-engine-system-works/l-intro-1710800607.jpg,eng-9418414

The services sector will now be prime owing to some of the bottlenecks businesses in the region have faced when trading in goods.

The East African Business Council (EABC), which is the regional lobby body for the private sector, recently held a two-day meeting in Nairobi, together with the East African Community (EAC) and other partners to devise new ways of advancing the integration agenda.

The meeting was aimed at revamping the Technical Working Group for this purpose. It was noted in the meeting how some of the tools put in place to reduce trade barriers and increase regional exchange of goods and services are not working. This is the reason why intra-EAC trade stands at 15 per cent.

But Annette Mutaawe Ssemuwemba, one of the co-chairs of the Technical Working Group and Deputy Secretary-General of Customs, Trade, and Monetary Affairs from the EAC Secretariat, said it may be that some of those tools are outdated.

""The region has moved forward. I do not think the instruments or mechanisms we had do not work but we have outgrown them,"" she said. ""Let us commend the good they brought but it is time to rethink and refresh.""

Ms. Ssemuwemba noted that the stagnation could also be informed by the fact that players are glossing over issues rather than tackling them head-on.

""But if we do not diagnose, if we are addressing the symptoms and not the problem, then we will continue having issues that we do not have a good understanding of,"" she said.

Some of the issues raised in the meeting involve Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs), the EAC Common External Tariff that recently introduced a fourth band to spur up manufacturing business in the region, harmonization of taxes, and border facilitation initiatives.

""But for each of these issues, further understanding is needed,"" she said. She gave an example of value chains, saying some sectors need to be unbundled and address issues affecting specific products.

""There are some challenges that are specific to some sectors. For example, in agricultural products like maize. We need to be sector-specific,"" she said.

The TWG is meant to reduce or avoid the narrative of blame games between the private sector and public that has stalled integration of the Community and instead come up with implementable solutions for collaboration.

""I am saying this because I have participated in such processes before and 10 years later we are still talking about the same things. I hope, and it is my expectation, that through the TWG, let's work differently and act as a think tank. Let us work collaboratively with the public and private sector,"" she said.

John Bosco Kalisa, EABC Executive Director and co-chair of the TWG pointed out some of the challenges which involve Stays of Application where countries defer implementation of the EAC Common External Tariff (CET).

EABC in 2023 called for the abolishment of these Stays of Application, saying it is creating an unleveled playing field for producers, manufacturers, and traders in the region.

Mr. Kalisa said there are over 1,000 Stays of Application. ""This is distorting trade,"" he said.

He said a survey was done on the EAC Common External Tariff and found that 67 per cent of businesses utilise the recently introduced fourth band structure. He noted that the EAC Common External Tariff structure has been lauded to be simpler compared to other trade blocs.

""There may be some ambiguities or issues but we can enhance that,"" he said.

Away from the Stays of Applications, Mr Kalisa noted of cross-border trade barriers saying goods originating from Partner States should not be treated the same way as those from outside the bloc. Instead, they should be given priority with designated queues or clearance desks.

""Our borders are becoming barriers to trade. Can we dismantle those borders or create designated queues for (EAC) goods?"" he posed.

Estella Aryada, Programme Coordinator EAC-GIZ, German Development Agency, said the region needs to be aware of the changing socio-economic environment citing services as a venture to delve into.

""Services are a growing component of our economy as we get into the new technology-based generation with aspects like artificial intelligence (AI),"" she said. ""We need to be at the forefront of ensuring that the private sector is equipped, understands the rules, and also has some interest in breaking into new services markets.""

She said the continent is populated by youth who may not be willing to wait until the EAC finishes integrating for them to benefit.

Ms. Aryada said even as GIZ, a key partner of EAC and EABC, acknowledges the challenges, there is a need to find new ways of doing things.

""If an approach is not working, I think we need to be honest enough to bring this to the table,"" she said.

She noted the narrative that some of the tools developed earlier are not as effective in addressing the existing trade barriers.

""If something is not working, let us build an honest dialogue to bring this to the fore and look for other ways of addressing the problem,"" she said.

According to the EAC, some of the priorities for 2022-2026 towards integration of the Community include: full implementation of the Single Customs Territory (SCT), enhancing domestication and implementation of regional commitments in line with the EAC Common Market Protocol, attainment of the EAC Single Currency, and strengthening regional peace, security, and good governance.

Other implementable goals are: development of quality multidimensional strategic infrastructure, institutional transformation of all EAC organs and institutions, and increasing the visibility of EAC stakeholders, knowledge, and awareness.

Some of the EAC achievements include: use of IDs as travel documents, removal of visa and work permits for East Africans, right of establishment of one common East African Electronic Passport, and establishment of One Network Area for both calls and data.",standardmedia.co.ke,news,Standard Digital News - Kenya,Graham Kajilwa,0.07450980392156858,448924116,1,https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/j3uUSE8PSSvTKpsI4aele2Sxlc0jHnsq9hTrAgN8.jpg,eng-9419951

Even the earliest images released in late 2022 showing a massive redesign for the next-generation Prius revealed Toyota's significant strides since debuting a hybrid sibling of the Echo way back in 1997. Though that first generation set the Prius concept in motion, the second generation arrived as a more serious standalone model and became, without a doubt, the most influential hybrid in history.

For 2023, the formerly unsightly fuel-sipper got a big glow-up matched by a serious power bump, plus more range for the Prime plug-in hybrid variant. In an era of EV stagnation, Prime confirms Toyota's commitment to plug-ins as a better solution for most buyers than a fully electric vehicle -- in contrast to the long-standing Subaru partnership that ended up with the peculiar bZ4X and Solterra twins.

Buyers who want a plug-in Prius can expect to add at least $5,025 to a base non-Prime's starting sticker of $27,950. Pricing can escalate quickly up towards the $50,000 out the door for fully loaded spec, but each Prime employs the same 2.0-liter gasoline engine paired with two electric motors, one of which modulates the internal-combustion engine's power delivery to the planetary gearbox. In full electric mode, the Prime can drive up to 44 miles, while employing the entire drivetrain produces a combined max of 220 horsepower.

That's a 99-horsepower leap up from the previous-generation Prius, all packaged within a svelte exterior that, despite undeniably looking better, also improves the formerly upright hatchback's peculiar aerodynamic tendency to sail around long bends at highway speeds. The new Prius rides lower on noticeably tighter suspension, while only sacrificing around nine cubic feet of interior space total for passengers or cargo versus the outgoing generation.

This base SE trim level arrived with 17-inch wheels to maximize electric and combined range, with a simple interior highlighted by an eight-inch infotainment touchscreen and manually adjustable cloth seats. The overall aesthetic edges towards a Spartan simplicity -- but maybe that's the point, since wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are all that most buyers really want, anyway.

The small-ish digital gauge cluster display, on the other hand, definitely seems a bit more complicated when packed full EV and ICE readouts. Toggling through two screen options removes the ""EcoScore"" and ""EcoZone"" prompts -- which fluctuate so wildly as to be almost irrelevant anyway -- in order to prioritize more common, useful driver data.

And really, it's almost difficult not to push the Prime hard through commuter traffic, which results in terrible EcoScores anyway. When hustling around town, the new suspension and improved power off the line can even produce hints of torque steer, something of a novel sensation compared to the positively sluggish performance of past generations.

Maximizing the Prime's range, on the other hand, actually takes some focus. In this regard, the plug-in hybrid edges nearer to a full EV -- in large part due to the peculiar decision by Toyota to default the car into full electric mode after every power cycle, rather than sticking with a previously selected ""HV"" mode to max out battery and internal-combustion range simultaneously. Similar to living with an EV, keeping track simply requires a shift in mindset while starting and driving the Prime.

This SE on the 17s quickly ran through 68% of battery in 21 miles of blissful ignorance, without selecting the HV mode once during a short midday errands run out in Los Angeles traffic. Then, while charging on a 120-volt garage outlet using the supplied cable, the 13.6-kilowatt-hour battery added 33 percent of charge in three hours on the dot. That pace falls right in the range for a nine-hour full charge estimated by the Prime's readout, and perfectly for anyone charging overnight via a standard outlet at home -- especially impressive, in fact, given that the same outlet never even registered while testing the charging potential of a Lucid Air or Ford F-150 Lightning.

Driving in full hybrid HV mode, on the other hand, barely dips into the battery and recharges quickly via regenerative braking (which can, at times, produce some odd pedal modulation when creeping along at lower speeds). A real-world expectation of 500-plus miles per 10.6-gallon fill-up seems eminently achievable, without a doubt.

Meanwhile, despite the lower and tighter suspension, on smoother roads the Prime cruises along at highway speeds quite comfortably. Rougher sections of the 405 freeway resulted in a bit of rafting and rollicking, though, while some tire hum does creep into the cabin, presumably due to Toyota withholding sound deadening and insulation in the name of pricing (or a potentially forthcoming reboot of the presumably more refined Lexus CT). And as usual, dipping deeper into throttle can produce hints of hybrid drone, where the 2.0-liter ICE engine stays happily in its ideal powerband while essentially acting more along the lines of a generator than a gasoline engine.

Still, Toyota's repositioning of Prius as a much more attractive hybrid with just enough power to border on sportier sensations absolutely transforms the staid spirit of every prior generation. This, finally, is the Prius that can -- and should -- help to bring the practical plug-in Prime to the masses.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.1764705882352942,448921523,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65ff2e8b6a762816f25685f1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,eng-9418414

The first stoppage happened moments after Ilott jumped to the top of the leaderboard, with repairs needed in Turn 5 after chunks of the racetrack appeared to be coming up. Following a lengthy stop that lasted nearly 49 minutes, the the session resumed.

Due to the extended break, an additional 15 minutes was added to the session.

However, it was short after Grosjean brought out another red flag with 57 minutes remaining after being stranded off course in Turn 15. He appeared to lock up the rear and drift off course.

The session resumed five minutes later, but another red flag came moments later for Kyle Kirkwood. The driver of the No. 27 Andretti Global Honda got out of shape after hitting a bump, which sent him off course and then caught air after hitting off course curbing and backed into the Turn 8 barrier, damaging the rear of his car. Fortunately, the repairs were quick and he was able to return before the session ended.

The fourth and final session is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET, with qualifying for tomorrow's heat races to follow at 8 p.m. ET.",motorsport.com,news,Motorsport.com,Joey Barnes,-0.01960784313725494,448916165,1,https://cdn-4.motorsport.com/images/amp/6b7B4mj0/s6/callum-ilott-arrow-mclaren-che.jpg,

While this bearish pressure has been widespread in the general cryptocurrency market, regulation uncertainty has been an additional concern for ETH, igniting a negative sentiment around the ""king of altcoins.""

Interestingly, the latest on-chain revelation shows a substantial amount of Ethereum has made its way to exchanges so far in March, suggesting that investors might be losing confidence in the long-term promise of the cryptocurrency.

Are Investors Losing Confidence In Ethereum?

According to data from CryptoQuant, more than $913 million has been recorded in net ETH transfers to centralized exchanges so far in March. This on-chain information was revealed via a quicktake post on the data analytics platform.

This net fund movement represents the largest volume of Ethereum transferred to centralized exchanges in a single month since June 2022. Even though March is still a week from being over, this exchange inflow appears to be a complete deviation from the pattern observed over the past few months.

As shown in the chart above, October 2023 was the last time cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed a positive net flow. It is worth noting that there was significant movement of Ethereum tokens out of the centralized platforms in subsequent months up until this month.

Meanwhile, a separate data point that supports the massive exodus of ETH to centralized exchanges has come to light. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X nearly 420,000 Ethereum tokens (equivalent to $1.47 billion) have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past three weeks.

The flow of large amounts of cryptocurrency to centralized exchanges is often considered a bearish sign, as it can be an indication that investors may be willing to sell their assets. Ultimately, this can put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price.

Substantial fund movements to trading platforms could also represent a shift in investor sentiment. It could be a sign that investors are losing faith in a particular asset (ETH, in this case).

Moreover, the recent regulatory headwind surrounding Ethereum specifically accentuates this hypothesis. According to the latest report, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a probe to classify the ETH token as a security.

The Shiba Inu community is celebrating a significant achievement as Shibarium, the Layer-2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has reached a new integration milestone. The platform has successfully processed over 412 million transactions, a testament to its growing adoption and functionality.

BlueBit, a Dubai and Saint Vincent-based centralized exchange, has announced an exciting collaboration with the SHIB community, a partnership that it believes will bring the SHIB and Sparrows communities closer and lead to even greater achievements together.

As part of this move, BlueBit has successfully integrated Shibarium, which would provide BlueBit users with access to a broader array of digital assets and cutting-edge blockchain solutions.

The integration of Shibarium with major cryptocurrency exchanges is also expected to play a pivotal role in increasing its visibility and usability, attracting a broader audience of users and investors.

The latest integration of Shibarium has sparked a wave of excitement in the wider crypto community. The Shiba Inu official X handle has responded with enthusiasm to this milestone, which reflects the platform's potential for future growth.

Shibarium's astounding growth

Shibarium has quickly gained traction since its late August 2023 launch, surpassing 3.8 million in total blocks and a whopping 412 million in total transactions.

According to the Shibariumscan explorer, the total transactions for Shibarium are 412,407,305. Total blocks have reached 3,825,223 and wallet addresses are at 1,383,613. However, Shibarium is reporting declines in its daily transaction count, which fell to 6,700.

In response to the increased activity and the inherent security risks associated with rapid growth, the Shiba Inu development team has taken proactive steps to safeguard the platform. Shiba Inu would be incorporating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) into its framework, thereby offering greater data privacy and security.

What we know so far about the new-generation Nissan X-Trail, Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5-rivalling hybrid family car","The Toyota RAV4, one of the most popular medium SUVs in Australia, is overdue for an overhaul. (Image credit: Thanos Pappas)

The Toyota RAV4 is the most popular medium SUV on the Australian market.

But times are changing and its rivals - including Nissan X-Trail, Honda CR-V and Kia Sportage - are putting the pressure on.

The current fifth-generation RAV4 has been around since 2018 so it's well overdue for more than a mere spit and polish.

The next-gen RAV4 is tipped to be available on our shores in 2025, but few confirmed details have been made public as yet, which is why speculation is rife and rumours are swirling.

What will the new 2025 Toyota RAV4 look like? What engine or hybrid set-up will it have? Is Toyota planning to make a full EV version? How much will the next-gen RAV4 cost?

Will Toyota go full gnarly and turn the RAV4 into a mini Land Cruiser (spoiler alert: probably not), or will it play it safe and just do a RAV4 that's even more gentrified? We'll find out soon-ish, but for now here's what we know so far about the next-gen RAV4...

The current RAV4 has a continuously variable transmission (in the hybrid) or an eight-speed automatic transmission (in the 2.5-litre petrol).

What engines will the 2025 Toyota RAV4 have?

Typically, RAV4 owners don't often express a desire or need for tree-stump-pulling torque in their favourite medium-size SUV, but that doesn't mean that car lovers everywhere aren't keen to know what Toyota is planning to throw in the new-gen RAV4 to move it along.

Will Toyota drop the 2.0-litre petrol and 2.5-litre petrol-only engines from RAV4 and commit to a comprehensive hybrid and EV line-up?

The RAV4's hybrid variants have thus far offered an appealing and accessible entry into the realm of non-ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles.

As we move rapidly into an age in which companies have to at least be seen to be doing their bit for the planet, Toyota looks set to continue with its commercially successful hybrid approach.

The RAV4's hybrid variants have thus far offered an appealing and accessible entry into the realm of non-ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles.

The RAV4 hybrid has a 2.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine and electric motor set-up with a 6.5 Amp hour nickel-metal hydride battery system.

Combined system output for power is 163kW (in the Hybrid electric AWD) and the torque output (courtesy of the combustion engine only) is 221Nm.

The current RAV4 has a continuously variable transmission (in the hybrid) or an eight-speed automatic transmission (in the 2.5-litre petrol), driving modes (including Eco, Normal and Sport), and an EV mode for driving only on battery power to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

The newer hybrid setup found in the related Lexus NX is also a distinct possibility for the next-gen RAV4. Oh and don't forget Toyota Australia says it's keen on plug-in hybrids now, so expect a PHEV - or 'Prime' as Toyota USA calls it - version to land on our shores in the next generation.

Typically, RAV4 owners don't often express a desire or need for tree-stump-pulling torque in their favourite medium-size SUV.

It's unclear whether Toyota will go offer EV variants of the RAV4, but if it does it will likely go with the existing bZ4X-based set-up - so there'll be front-wheel-drive (FWD) variants (150kW and 266Nm, with a front-mounted electric motor that drives the front wheels), and dual-motor AWD (160kW and 337Nm, with a second electric motor at the rear axle).

These bZ4X variants have a 71.4kWh lithium-ion battery, yielding 436km of driving range for the FWDs, and 411km for the AWDs. Driving ranges in the RAV4 may vary because of its eventual kerb weight in EV form.

What platform will the 2025 Toyota RAV4 use?

The TNGA platform (Toyota New Global Architecture) is a modular unibody shared between Toyota vehicles and as a result the current RAV4 has a shorter, lower and wider body than before, but has a longer wheelbase and wider track.

This modular architecture underpinning the RAV4 is the TNGA-K medium-to-large platform and that also underpins the likes of the Kluger and Camry, as well as the Lexus NX and RX. It is expected to roll on an updated version of this platform, ushering in improvements to rigidity and more.

Will Toyota drop the 2.0-litre petrol and 2.5-litre petrol-only engines from RAV4 and commit to a comprehensive hybrid and EV line-up?

What will the 2025 Toyota RAV4 look like?

Check out our artist's renders of what the next-gen RAV4 might look like.

Some believe the new-gen RAV4 will stick closer to the current model - sleek but chunky but not too chunky - while others believe that Toyota will wholeheartedly go the way of the upcoming Prado (aka 250 Series LandCruiser) and turn the RAV4 into a smaller LandCruiser.

The aforementioned new raft of LandCruisers all sport an entirely new look and feel - kind of a uniformly trad-cool design across the different models - and chances are Toyota is planning to punch some of that retro styling into the next-gen RAV4.

At the moment, for a current-gen RAV4 you can expect to pay anywhere from $39,760 (excluding on-road costs) through to $58,360.

How much will the 2025 Toyota RAV4 cost?

At the moment, for a current-gen RAV4 you can expect to pay anywhere from $39,760 (excluding on-road costs) for a 2024 RAV4 GX 2WD through to $58,360 (excluding on-road costs) for a 2024 RAV4 Edge (AWD) Hybrid.

Nothing gets cheaper, so expect to pay at least a few grand more than that for some variants in the next-gen RAV4 line-up, especially with new tech, new variants, and potentially new powertrains on offer.

When will the 2025 Toyota RAV4 go on sale in Australia?

So, when will we get it here in Australia?

MG Pilot Safety includes Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Emergency Lane Keep Assist (LKAS) and Adaptive Cruise Control.

The Trophy MG3 Hybrid+ delivers even more comfort, style and convenience including a 360 degree camera, heated front seats and steering wheel, keyless entry, privacy glass, rain sensing wipers and LED projector headlights.

At the heart of the new MG3 is its highly efficient Hybrid+ powertrain which is poised to bring some enjoyable MG performance and verve to the supermini sector.

The combination of a larger than average battery (1.83kWh) and high-performance electric motor (100kW) enables the MG3 to go fully electric for city driving, which sets it apart from many other hybrid superminis. For longer journeys, there is the reassurance of a 1.5-litre petrol engine.

Advanced smart features of Hybrid+ include a drive and charge system that allows the petrol engine to drive the wheels whilst also charging the battery through the generator.

The MG3 Hybrid+ returns impressive economy figures of 64.2mpg (4.4l/100km) and 100g/km of CO2.

As the Jaguar Land Rover group prepares for its all-electric future in the coming years, the British marque has begun rolling out an extensive electrified line-up with some impressive all-electric range claims. The all-new Range Rover Sport P550e enters the competitive PHEV SUV realm as the champion, with a class-leading range claim. The new-generation L461 Sport sits on JLR's MLA-Fex platform, which it designed specifically for full electrification.

The P550e is the top-of-the-range PHEV option and the only hybrid derivative available in the U.S. It replaces the short-lived P440e, but introduces a higher specification, more power, and improved EV capabilities, albeit at a much higher price point. Most luxury carmakers are heavily investing in electrification, but it looks like JLR's unwavering dedication to disbanding the ICE motivates it to create class-leading PHEV options.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Range Rover's websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA, Car and Driver, and Edmunds.

The EPA still needs to test the Range Rover Sport P550e, so we don't have realistic consumption and battery electric range estimates. Range Rover claims that its 31.8 kWh battery is enough to drive the SUV 53 miles before you need to plug it in for recharging.

The previous P440e boasts a 51-mile EPA range estimate. The model features the company's AJ300 twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter straight-six and permanent-magnet electric motor driving all four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.

(Data sourced from Range Rover)

This system generates a combined 542 horsepower and 516 pound-feet, resulting in a claimed 4.7-second 0-60 MPH time and 150-MPH top speed. The P550e is an all-new model yet to be tested by reputable publications, so we don't have a realistic indication of how it performs in real-world conditions. For reference, tests reveal the non-hybrid P360 to accelerate from 0-60 MPH in 5.7 seconds, but this only produces 355 horsepower.

The Range Rover Sport P550e Costs $118,200

Range Rover's decision to make its PHEV option a flagship Autobiography trim results in an eye-watering $118,200 starting price, making it significantly more expensive than its European and American rivals. The trade-off is an impressive specification and a near-unrivaled in-cabin luxury experience. Range Rovers are traditionally more expensive options that bridge the gap between premium European manufacturers and more high-end marques from the likes of Bentley and Rolls-Royce.

The Sport is a more compact variation of the Range Rover, which is also available with the P550e powertrain, boasting a $141,100 starting price. This model is just a bit slower than the Sport, but it boasts similar EV range claims. This information is redundant, as Range Rover has already sold its entire P550e allocation in the USA.

The Range Rover Sport appear as an urban crawler, but the brand ensures it has enough gusto to do some hard work. The turbocharged PHEV system boasts an impressive but not class-leading 6,614-pound towing capacity and 1,576 payload limit from its 29.5 cubic-feet trunk. To make the most of the Range Rover Sport's towing abilities, you'll have to fit the $750 tow hitch receiver and the $450 Advanced Tow Assist package.

You can make the most of its decent payload abilities via various storage and cargo packages. This includes a $5,000 Equestrian Pack, which adds an array of trimmings and equipment you can use for an enjoyable ride across the countryside on your horse. There's also a Convenience Pack, which adds powered gesture control to the tailgate and a cargo space partition net.

The Range Rover Sport Offers A Luxurious Cabin Experience

The Range Rover Sport's MLA-Flex chassis results in some generous interior space, with the front row accommodating 38.8 inches of headroom, 40.3 inches of legroom, and 60.8 inches of shoulder room. The rear features 39 inches of headroom, 37.7 inches of legroom, and 59.1 inches of shoulder room. If you want to carry some larger items, you can fold the second row down to increase cargo space to 65.7 cubic-feet.

Range Rover prioritizes luxury in the Sport's cabin, as the Autobiography trim lays host to perforated Semi-Aniline leather upholstery, natural black wood veneer, and suede cloth headlining. Sportier or more luxurious finishes are optionally available. Range Rover's catalog is famously diverse, so there is a lot of potential to create a truly individual and unique specification.

Warranty And Reliability

Range Rovers are famous for their undependable mechanical components. Thus far, the Sport appears to embrace a more reliable reputation, as the 2024 model only has one recall attached to it, relating to improperly bonded body panels. Considering its extreme price and poor reputation, Range Rover's standard warranty is a bit of a let-down.

In the operation, 16 people have been arrested, eleven men and five women, aged between 33 and 49 years and all of Spanish origin, as alleged perpetrators of the crimes of drug trafficking and membership in a criminal organization.

The investigations, carried out by the Local Judicial Police Brigade of Sagunto (Valencia), began in May 2023, when the agents learned that a man residing in a home in the Valencian town of Gilet was dedicating himself to the distribution of drugs.

The agents' investigations made it possible to corroborate the illicit activity, as well as confirm that lower-level distributors, mainly residents of Sagunto, went to that address, traveling there to obtain different types of narcotic substances.

All of them were part of an alleged criminal organization, whose main managers were a couple residing in the town of Albal and a man settled in the city of Valencia, reports the National Police.

In this police operation, in which units such as Canine Guides, the Police Intervention Unit (UIP), the Prevention and Reaction Unit (UPR) and the Special Security Operational Group (GOES) have participated, eleven searches were carried out domiciliary.

They seized 930 grams of cocaine, 261 of marijuana and nearly 400 of hashish, as well as numerous anabolic substances, 242,880 euros, cryptocurrencies, four high-end vehicles, seven hunting shotguns and various prohibited weapons, such as taser devices, extendable defenses, boxing keys and non-approved pepper spray.

Damage assessments are underway.

Source: Ukrhydroenergo CEO Ihor Syrota

Details: Syrota reported that Dnipro HPP is not generating electricity, and the timeframe for resuming its operations is still unknown. He also noted that certain tests are being carried out.

""The fact that there is equipment that will not be repaired but has to be replaced is obvious. We realise this is custom-made equipment, and its production time is lengthy. However, we can report on the equipment that can be replaced and overhauled later,"" said Syrota.

Background: The missile attack on the Dnipro HPP became possible due to the lack of a proper response from the international community to the environmental disaster caused by Russia's blowing up of the Kakhovka HPP in June 2023. At the same time, Ukrhydroenergo does not rule out possible Russian intentions to completely destroy the Dnipro HPP.

The full assessment and examination of the damage dealt to the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) by Russian missile strikes will take about three days.

Ukrhydroenergo reported two direct hits to HPP-1 and HPP-2 generating stations of Dnipro HPP in Zaporizhzhia. The repairability of HPP-2 is still unknown, as it has suffered severe damage.

A Montana rancher created giant hybrid sheep and sold them for hunting, creating the lambs by using illegally imported genetic material from the world's largest sheep species, federal prosecutors say.

The moneymaking scheme sought to create a hybrid species of sheep that could be sold at a high price to hunting preserves in the United States and would mimic the world's biggest breed, the Marco Polo argali sheep, a threatened species that lives in central Asia and is prized by trophy hunters.

Arthur ""Jack"" Schubarth, 80, created more than 150 cloned embryos of the species and successfully bred a male Marco Polo argali, selling one of its offspring for $10,000, according to the criminal complaint filed against him by federal prosecutors. He used the sheep's semen to breed it with other species, creating hybrid sheep and selling them to people in Texas and Minnesota.

Schubarth pleaded guilty to the two felony wildlife counts against him in March in federal court. He faces up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000.

Schubarth sold and bred mountain sheep, mountain goats and similar breeds at his 215-acre ranch in Vaughn, Mont. He began his effort to clone the Marco Polo argali in 2013, working with at least five other people - all unnamed in court documents - over the course of eight years, prosecutors said. No one else has been charged in connection with the case, the Justice Department said Thursday.

""This was an audacious scheme to create massive hybrid sheep species to be sold and hunted as trophies,"" Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division said in a statement.

Schubarth's attorney, Jason Holden, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Post.

Marco Polo argali sheep have distinctive spiraling horns and can weigh more than 300 pounds. They are big prizes for trophy hunters, who travel to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Mongolia to hunt them.

The breed is protected by an international convention and under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which lists the species as threatened. They are on Montana's list of prohibited exotic wildlife.

Sheep with larger horns and bodies are worth more to hunters, including at private shooting preserves, where hunters pay to pursue captive game. That means they can be sold to such facilities at higher prices.

To carry out his scheme, Schubarth obtained tissue from a Marco Polo argali that had been hunted in Kyrgyzstan from someone who smuggled it into the United States, according to the complaint. He then took the sheep tissue to a lab, which used it to create 165 cloned embryos.

Schubarth had embryos implanted in some of the ewes on his ranch, which resulted in the birth of a purebred male Marco Polo argali, which Schubarth named Montana Mountain King.

He then used Montana Mountain King's sperm to impregnate other species of ewe, bringing species that are prohibited in Montana across state lines to do so. That also included buying and selling parts of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep in violation of state laws, according to prosecutors. He also sold Montana Mountain King's semen.

The scheme broke state and federal laws relating to animal import and export, game animals and animal protection. By introducing new genetic material into sheep, it also potentially threatened the health of native sheep populations, prosecutors and state wildlife officials said.

""The kind of crime we uncovered here could threaten the integrity of our wildlife species in Montana,"" said Ron Howell, chief of enforcement for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks.

In court documents, prosecutors described an elaborate effort among Schubarth and others to breed and transport the sheep. Someone he worked with falsely declared Montana Mountain King's offspring as a different species to obtain state veterinary certificates that would permit them to move the sheep across state lines, the complaint alleges. Another accomplice was the person who allegedly brought the hunted Marco Polo argali tissue to the United States.

Schubarth sold dozens of straws of Montana Mountain King's semen to people in Texas and Minnesota, and they illegally moved ewes from both states to Schubarth's ranch to be artificially inseminated, the complaint alleges. They then transported Montana Mountain King's offspring to Texas and Minnesota.

In addition to the $10,000 sheep, Schubarth sold 11 sheep with one-quarter of Montana Mountain King's genetics for $13,200 total to two people in Texas, prosecutors said.",startribune.com,news,Star Tribune,,0.1215686274509804,448895330,1,https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/7TVZRILCMZF2VDGW73ABMFIZYY.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces,

The posited mechanism of charging is that (i) water droplets on surfaces contain HO and OH with chemical potentials that depend principally on surface chemistry but also other factors (e.g., preexisting ion concentration, humidity, electric fields, etc.), (ii) water-ions can diffuse between surfaces when they are sufficiently close, and (iii) the relative abundance of water-ions on two surfaces following diffusion events is biased by the relative chemical potentials. Here, water ions may arise from ambient water, as suggested by previous experimental studies, but all calculations are agnostic to their precise origin.

Figure 1B illustrates contrasting scenarios of water droplets present on surfaces, A (blue) and B (red), that guide our calculations. In reference State I, droplets are neutral on both surfaces. In State II, contact yields a charge-separated pair where HO resides on A and OH resides on B; the free energy of State II relative to State I is . In State III, contact yields a charge-separated pair, which is the reverse of State II; the free energy of State III relative to State I is . These free energies are obtained as and where indicates the free energy of adding an ion of type α ∈ [ + , - ] to surface S ∈ [A, B] (Fig. 1B, bottom). The difference reflects an initial thermodynamic driving force for contact charging. In particular, indicates greater likelihood for surface A to become positively charged and surface B negative compared to the opposite, while indicates greater likelihood for surface A to become negatively charged and surface B positive. Note that = - relates to the exchange A + B → A + B, but also, = - reflects a difference in relative partitioning between surfaces of the ions. As such, contact charging can arise even if both ions favor the same surface given disparity in transfer free energies. Consequently, predicts the direction of charge-transfer between contacting surfaces if the charge-carrier species are HO and/or OH and populations are thermodynamically controlled and charge-transfer events are independent.

To test this hypothesis, we consider six commodity polymers (Fig. 1C): polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), Nylon 66 (N66), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). These polymers are relevant to prior contact charging experiments, and our recent work illustrates distinct wetting behavior arising from chemically and morphologically specific water-polymer surface interactions. As in ref. , we consider amorphous surfaces (for all six polymers), crystalline surfaces (denoted N66, PE, and PVC), and surfaces featuring different tacticity (PVA denoting isotactic PVA); calculations are performed for various droplet sizes. The combination of surface chemistry, morphology, and droplet sizes is expected to yield many distinct nanoenvironments that influence water-ion free-energies. Ultimately, is computed for all pairwise combinations to predict thermodynamic preference for water-ion transfer (see Methods).

The hypothesis is evaluated by comparison to experimental triboelectric series, which organize materials according to their relative propensity to acquire charges during contact charging. Conventionally, triboelectric series are represented in a one-dimensional progression based on relative propensity to acquire positive/negative charge, although results do not always neatly and consistently organize in this manner. We reference three previously reported triboelectric series that feature the polymers in this study as 'S1', 'S2', and 'S3'. These three series provide relatively consistent expectations, although there are some differences and/or omissions. In S1, the ordering, from more positive to negative, is N66, PVA, PMMA, PE, PVC, and PTFE. In S2 and S3, PVA is absent, the positions of PVC and PTFE are switched in S2, and the positions of N66 and PMMA are switched in S3. Less complete polymer triboelectric series can be formulated from elsewhere and display overall similar trends (Suppl. Fig. 1).

Figure 2A depicts a triboelectric matrix derived from values; this matrix is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to extract the free energies for adding water-ions in Fig. 2B, C. To first order, the matrix is organized by material (6 × 6 matrix), and results are further resolved for each A-B into a 5 × 5 sub-matrix based on water-droplet size; color intensity reflects the magnitude of thermodynamic driving force. Compared to experimental triboelectric series (Suppl. Fig. 1), the simulation results broadly align with the direction of charging observed in S1, S2, and S3. In comparison to S1, simulation predictions agree with nine of fifteen material combinations, while three pairs yield inconclusive results or depend on droplet size, and three pairs exhibit opposite trends. However, when compared to S2 and S3 (which lack data for PVA), the agreement improves, as simulations predict PVC acquires negative charge over PTFE (as in S2) and N66 acquires negative charge over PMMA (as in S3). Thus, the thermodynamically informed predictions capture general trends in contact charging between polymers of different chemistry.

The few disparities between simulation predictions and empirical charging results arise in material pairings that also demonstrate experimental variability. For PVC-PTFE, S1 and S3 (and other series, see Suppl. Fig. 1) suggest that PTFE exhibits a strong tendency to acquire negative charge. However, our previous study on polymer hydrophobicity indicates that water structuring and dynamics are relatively more similar between PTFE and PE than with PVC. These prior observations align with our current free-energy results, showing a vanishing for PE-PTFE and consistent behavior between PE-PVC and PTFE-PVC, and the experimental outcome reported via S2. Consequently, results involving PTFE may be sensitive to experimental conditions, potentially related to mechanisms not captured by simulations, such as the presence of acid and base groups post polymerization, bond breaking, or minor inaccuracies in molecular models. For N66-PMMA, S1 and S3 differ, with the latter aligning with the thermodynamic predictions. Lastly, several inconsistent or inconclusive combinations involve PVA; the aqueous solubility of PVA poses an experimental challenge and is also a notable factor in our previous study. Considering the substantial agreement for many material pairings and the technical challenges encountered with others, we conclude that thermodynamically driven water-ion transfer can plausibly influence polymer-polymer contact charging.

Analysis of the polymer-water interface provides nanoscale insights into the trends of water-ion free energies. To first order, we note general correlation with metrics of polymer hydrophobcity. Overall, hydrogen-bonding polymers (PMMA, N66, PVA) tend to acquire positive charge more easily than non-hydrogen-bonding polymers (PE, PTFE, PVC). Furthermore, within those respective groups, increasing hydrophobicity tends to correlate with more positive-charging. To further understand these trends and how they manifest, we examine the ion-water-polymer interactions. Figure 3A compares how water, HO, and OH distribute in the vicinity of chemically distinct, amorphous polymer surfaces.

Relative to OH, HO tends to reside closer to the polymer-water interface, orienting its oxygen atom to maximize hydrogen-bond donation to water (Suppl. Fig. 2). Surfaces lacking hydrogen bonds, such as PE, PTFE, and PVC, allow easy access for HO to the interfacial layers, explaining the similar free energy values () observed in Fig. 2B. However, HO is relatively more stable (lower ) in proximity to hydrogen-bonding polymers (PMMA, N66, and PVA). The stronger interfacial interactions with PMMA, N66, and PVA also explain the apparent insensitivity of to droplet size (Fig. 2B), as the preferred nanoenvironment of HO remains relatively consistent as droplet size increases. Notably, HO is predominantly excluded from the interfacial layer of PVA, the most hydrophilic polymer, aligning with its higher compared to PMMA and N66. This highlights an intriguing interplay between ion-polymer interactions and competing water interactions, such that ion chemical potential is not a monotonic function of hydrophilicity.

Although OH predominantly situates in secondary interfacial layers or the bulk of water droplets, its trends also correlate with hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding behavior. The nearly equivalent between PE and PTFE reflects consistency in OH distribution, which derives from their similarity in hydrophobicity and contact angles. Water-ions are not notably stabilized in PE and PTFE relative to free water droplets (Suppl. Fig. 5), likely because PE and PTFE create typical hydrophobic interfaces that do not significantly impact water structure. This implies that charging trends of PE and PTFE are mostly dictated by the other polymer in the contact-pair. In other words, the propensity for PTFE to acquire negative charge over N66, for example, is not due to its affinity for OH but rather the affinity of N66 towards HO. Free-energy trends among N66, PVA, and PMMA align with hydrogen-bonding behavior. While N66 and PVA offer stabilizing interactions that lower , PMMA only functions as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, disturbing the hydrogen-bonding network of OH (Fig. 3C) and effectively excluding OH from the interfacial layer of water, resulting in higher . In contrast to PMMA, water in proximity to PVC orients its oxygen atoms towards the surface because of the strong attraction of chlorine atoms, which allows water molecules to readily form hydrogen bonds with OH in the second water layer (Fig. 3B). Thus, distinct nanoenvironments for HO and OH arise from the hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding behavior of the polymer surfaces, largely explaining trends in and .

To further explore the sensitivity of and to interfacial interactions, we assess the role of nanoscale polymer surface morphology, which can influence hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding behaviors. Figure 3D, E shows the difference in and between amorphous and crystalline surfaces (for PE, PVC, and N66) and between atactic and isotactic amorphous surfaces (for PVA). Overall, the simulations capture some sensitivity of and to surface morphology, but the extent depends on polymer chemistry. The transition from PE to PE has no notable effect, as water structuring near PE remains similar to that of PE, resulting in nearly equivalent nanoenvironments for HO and OH and correspondingly indistinguishable free energies. However, for PVA, PVC, and N66, or can shift on scales relevant for charging predictions in Fig. 2A. Increased intra-chain hydrogen bonding and reduced hydrogen bonding with water for PVA permits more favorable water-structuring around OH, thereby increasing its stability. In N66, the crystalline structure similarly reduces hydrogen bonding with water and results in a more hydrophobic surface, creating a less favorable nanoenvironment for HO within the interfacial layer. In PVC, enhanced chain interactions diminish interfacial water structuring, subsequently weakening interactions with OH in secondary water layers. These findings underscore the importance of polymer-water interactions in water-ion free energies and indicate how surface heterogeneities and semicrystallinity may subtly influence water-ion transfer and contact charging.

Although thermodynamic driving forces for ion transfer are most significant when considering different surfaces, Fig. 2B, C show that the free energy of water-ions is also influenced by droplet size, and Fig. 3D illustrates sensitivity to surface heterogeneities. The former effect is evident in the internal color variation within the diagonal material squares in Fig. 2A. Notably, for more hydrophilic polymers (PMMA, N66, and PVA), the thermodynamic driving forces are comparable to those for chemically distinct surfaces (off-diagonal squares of Fig. 2A); Fig. 3D also conveys non-trivial differences that exceed 5 kcal/mol. These findings may have implications for contact charging of chemically identical materials. If water exists on polymer surfaces as droplets of varying sizes or the surfaces vary in crystallinity/patterning, these results suggest that those variabilities could create additional thermodynamic driving forces for ion redistribution and subsequent contact charging. Considering that relative humidity likely influences the distribution of droplet sizes on a surface, resulting differences in water-ion chemical potentials might account for certain humidity effects on contact charging. It is notable that the free energy of HO appears less sensitive to droplet size compared to OH, particularly for hydrophilic polymers. In addition, as polymer surfaces become increasingly wet, we anticipate that any thermodynamic driving force for ion-transfer between surfaces will diminish since the contribution of the water-polymer interface will comprise an overall lesser fraction of the total ion free energy; such an effect could relate to observations of decreased contact charging at high relative humidity. Although the present work does not thoroughly analyze the implications of droplet or surface heterogeneities or the precise connection between droplet size and humidity, such factors could be considered in future work.

In the preceding analysis, calculating involved simulating a water droplet containing a single ion above isolated polymer surfaces. As a more stringent test of these predictions, we conduct simulations with both HO and OH present between distinct polymer surfaces and assess preferential partitioning. Figure 4A illustrates the simulation setup wherein a water bridge (N = 4000) containing a HO/OH pair forms between surfaces A (top) and B (bottom) separated by distance d. The propensity for surfaces to acquire specific charges is measured via the free energy F(p) where the collective variable is the dipole of the ionic pair in z-direction. As a collective variable, p reports the relative positioning of water ions with respect to the two surfaces: more positive p indicates HO is closer to surface A and OH is closer to B, more negative p indicates the opposite, and small p suggests little to no asymmetric affinity. Similar to , we examine the change in free energy when the dipole is flipped: where represents a pseudo-equilibrium constant for the exchange process . Expected scenarios for K(p) are depicted in Fig. 4B. For example, if K(p) > 1, HO should preferentially partition towards A, with the expectation that A becomes relatively positive and B negative. The free energy F(p) is computed using umbrella sampling and the weighted histogram analysis method; further details regarding the calculation and formulation of K(p) are in 'Methods.'

Results of the two-surface simulations align well with the expectations from (Fig. 2A) and the structural analysis (Fig. 3). Figure 4C displays K(p) for different pairs of materials, with row labels corresponding to surface A and column labels corresponding to surface B. For PE-PTFE, K(p) ~ 1, which is consistent with prior discussion on the similarity of water/ion nanoenvironments. In PVA-PTFE and PVA-PE, for which results from single-surface calculations (Fig. 2B, C) were mixed and dependent on droplet size, K(p) < 1 indicating that OH prefers PVA over the more hydrophobic PTFE and PE. This preference arises mainly from the recruitment of water towards the more hydrophilic surface (Suppl. Fig. 4) rather than surface-specific interactions. The remaining pairs yield K(p) > 1, indicating enhanced thermodynamic stability of HO closer to surface A (row) and for OH to be closer to B (column) than the reverse situation. Thus, the two-surface simulations provide valuable validation for the overall thermodynamic framework and offer more direct support of thermodynamically driven water-ion transfer as a mechanism of contact charging.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.1058823529411765,448895166,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46932-2/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46932_Fig1_HTML.png,

We hypothesize that each such mechanism may involve various taxa, functions, and metabolites which act in concert in disease, and thus MintTea aims to identify robust ""disease-associated multi-omic modules"", each comprising a set of features from the various omics that both exhibit coordinated variation across omics and, as a whole, associate with the disease or phenotype of interest. We applied MintTea to 9 diverse case-control cohorts with available shotgun metagenomics data (processed into both taxonomic and functional profiles), 6 of which further included fecal or serum metabolomics data. We demonstrated that MintTea was indeed able to capture modules that had high predictive power of the disease (often comparable with that achieved by using all features), while also exhibiting significant correlations between features from different omics. We also showed that some of the modules identified by MintTea recapitulated previous observations concerning the role of the gut microbiome in disease, and provided a catalog of identified multi-omic modules across all datasets analyzed. This work thus serves as a proof of concept for the benefit of advanced integration methods in generating integrated multi-omic biological hypotheses underlying microbiome-disease associations.

Introducing MintTea: a framework for identifying robust disease-associated microbiome multi-omic modules

Inspired by the potential of intermediate integration methods described above, we developed a multi-omic integration framework, termed ""MintTea"" (Multi-omic INTegration Tool for microbiomE Analysis), for identifying sets of features from multiple different omics that are strongly associated both with the disease and with each other (Fig. 1A). MintTea is based on sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis (sGCCA) and other previously introduced related methods, and further applies repeated sampling, consensus analysis, and module evaluation to account for noisy data and to ensure robust and confident results.

Briefly, MintTea receives two or more feature tables describing different omics obtained for the same set of samples, as well as a label (e.g., healthy vs. disease) for each sample, as input. Following filtration of rare features and other preprocessing steps (see Methods), MintTea encodes the label as an additional omic (containing a single feature) as previously suggested, and then applies sGCCA, searching for a sparse linear transformation per feature table that yields maximal correlations between the respective latent variables, as well as between these variables and the label (Fig. 1A top). This procedure yields a latent variable per feature table (omic), which is a sparse linear combination of the various features. We then record the set of features that were assigned non-zero coefficients across the various omics, and define this set as the first ""putative module"". sGCCA can then find additional sets of latent variables that are orthogonal to the previous ones, by deflation on those previous latent variables, with each iteration similarly providing a new putative module. Next, to identify specific modules of features that are robust to small changes in the input data, MintTea repeats the entire process multiple times on random data subsets (e.g., 90% of the samples) and records the resulting putative modules from each such iteration. It then constructs a co-occurrence network, where features are connected if they consistently co-occurred in the same putative module (e.g., over 80% of total iterations), and identifies ""consensus modules"" (i.e., connected subgraphs; see Methods; Fig. 1A middle). Importantly, as MintTea balances between two objectives, namely associations between omics and associations with the phenotype, the resulting consensus module may capture only one of these two objectives. Accordingly, to output robust, disease-associated, and cross-omic correlated modules, MintTea finally evaluates each consensus module, discarding modules that do not adhere to the desired criteria. To this end, it first filters out any module in which the average cross-omic correlation is not higher than that obtained for random modules. Then, MintTea applies principal component analysis (PCA) to all the features included in each remaining module, uses the first principal component (PC) of each module as the module's representative, quantifies how well this one representative PC predicts the disease using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and preserves only modules for which this AUC is >0.7 and higher than AUC obtained for random module (of the same size and distribution over omics; see Methods; Fig. 1A bottom). The final outcome of MintTea is therefore multiple ""disease-associated, multi-omic modules"", each capturing features from multiple omics that are highly correlated across the different omics, and also with the disease.

In Supplementary Note 1, we discuss the conceptual differences between MintTea and other related approaches, and quantitatively compare MintTea to other sGCCA-based methods, demonstrating that MintTea provides a good balance across multiple desired properties, while achieving a substantially lower false discovery rate.

Using MintTea for identifying multi-omic modules across cohorts and diseases

To examine MintTea's ability to identify disease-associated multi-omic modules in various settings, we obtained 9 different datasets of shotgun metagenomics sequencing. All datasets are from case-control studies, spanning multiple health conditions and diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), CRC, metabolic syndrome (MS), type-2 diabetes (T2D) and others. For each dataset, we generated 2-3 different feature tables ('views') based on the available omic data. Specifically, in all datasets, metagenomic data was available and processed into taxonomic profiles (""T"") and pathway-level functional profiles (""P"") (see Methods). In addition, for 3 of the datasets, fecal metabolomics data (""M"") were also available, and for 2 others datasets, fasting serum metabolomics data (""S"") were available. Figure 1B, C summarizes the omics and datasets used for the main analysis (and see also Supplementary Data File S1).

Applying MintTea to these 9 datasets, we found 2-5 consensus modules per dataset, each comprising 2 to 38 features from the various omics (average: 13.23; Fig. 2A; Supplementary Data File S2; Supplementary Data File S3). Most of these modules captured correlations between features from different omics that significantly exceed those of randomly sampled modules (Fig. 2B), with 1-2 modules per dataset also exhibiting strong association with the disease, as defined above (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Data Files S2 and S4). In the T2D (MetaCardis) dataset, for example, we identified 5 consensus modules, 2 of which also passed our evaluation and were classified as disease-associated multi-omic modules, with AUCs reaching 0.86 (based on the 1 PC of the 21 features in this module) and 0.73 (based on only 2 features in this module), compared to 0.71 and 0.64 on average, respectively, when evaluating randomly selected modules. In the late-stage CRC dataset (Yachida, 2019), as another example, we found 2 consensus modules, one of which was classified as a disease-associated multi-omic module with an AUC of 0.72 compared to only 0.63 using equivalent, randomly selected modules (more on this module below). The entire list of identified modules, as well as detailed statistics about their association with disease and correlations between features across omics, is provided in Supplementary Data Files S2-S4).

While most of our analyses below focus only on disease-associated multi-omic modules (i.e., modules that passed our evaluation phase and adhere to the criteria we defined), we also sought to evaluate the overall predictive power of all identified consensus modules in each dataset in order to gain a better understanding of CCA-based methods' ability to identify informative axes of variation in the data. To this end, we trained random forest (RF) models on the 1 PCs of all modules in each dataset, and estimated their combined predictive accuracy (with cross-validation). We further compared the AUC's of these models to RF models trained on the entire concatenated multi-omic data (referred to as an ""early integration"" approach; see Methods; Supplementary Data File S5). We found that in most cases, these consensus modules by themselves achieved an AUC comparable to that of the early-integration models, while utilizing a substantially smaller number of features in total (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the UC (Franzosa, 2019) dataset, for example, the 4 consensus modules identified by MintTea (totaling 73 features) achieved a total AUC of 0.885 (SD: 0.12), where each module is represented by its 1 PC as explained above. In comparison, the early integration approaches achieved a similar AUC of 0.882 (SD: 0.14), but used 235 features on average for training the RF model after feature selection. Similarly, the overall AUC of the CRC (Feng, 2015) modules was 0.839 (SD: 0.15), utilizing 36 features in just 3 modules (and hence based on just 3 values), compared to 0.824 (SD: 0.15) using early-integration-based on 103 features.

It should also be noted that the features included in the disease-associated multi-omic modules reported above, did not necessarily overlap with those ranked highest by the early integrated multi-omic models. Specifically, on average, only 63.9% (SD: 24.8%) of the features comprising each disease-associated module (as defined above), were also significant contributors to the multi-omic early-integration models (see Methods, Supplementary Data File S6). This observation may attest to the ability of the intermediate integration approach to consider features in the context of their associations with other features and not only their association with disease.

Disease-associated multi-omic modules reveal multifaceted biological signatures

Figure 2D presents one example of a MintTea module identified in the late-stage CRC dataset. This module included 7 features in total; 3 bacterial species, namely Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gemella morbillorum, and 4 fecal metabolites: 2 branched-chain amino acids (BCAA's), namely valine (Val) and leucine (Leu), an aromatic amino acid - phenylalanine (Phe), and cysteine-glutathione disulfide divalent. The 1 PC of the 7 features included in this module, by itself, yielded an AUC of 0.72 in classifying disease state (Fig. 2C), and the average Spearman correlation between features from different omics was 0.28 (all correlations had an FDR-corrected p value < 0.05, Supplementary Data File S4). All features in this module, except for the last, were significantly elevated in disease (Mann-Whitney tests, FDR < 0.05), and were also reported as disease biomarkers in multiple other independent studies. Specifically, in the original paper by Yachida et al., all three species were overrepresented consistently across all disease stages, as opposed to other species that were elevated in specific stages only. A similar trend was reported for the three amino acids (Val, Leu and Phe), indicating a coordinated pattern with the above taxa. P. stomatis and G. morbillorum were also found to have significantly high replication rates compared to controls across all cancer stages in that study, hinting at their increased metabolic activity during cancer development. One possible explanation for Peptostreptococcus species appearing together with the BCAA's is their involvement in BCAA metabolism. Interestingly, Peptostreptococci species were specifically identified as major fermenters of Phe and Leu, while the most prominent CRC-associated species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, for comparison, was reported to prefer different amino acid substrates in the same review study. Phenylalanine was also significantly and positively correlated with both P. stomatis and G. morbillorum in a recent meta-analysis. Lastly, though we could not recover a mechanistic link between cysteine-glutathione disulfide and the other features, we note that the correlations between this metabolite and the other 3 amino acids were strikingly high, even when controlling for disease state (with all Spearman and partial Spearman correlations and FDR).

Another example, illustrated in Fig. 2E, is a module identified in the metabolic syndrome (MS) cohort of MetaCardis (these are subjects with MS according to International Diabetes Federation criteria, without type 2 diabetes (T2D) or coronary artery disease). This module included 8 species (2 of which lacking taxonomic annotation), 4 pathways, and 9 serum metabolites (measured by either NMR or mass spectrometry), with the 1st PC of these features achieving an AUC of 0.72 for predicting MS. Notably, the interplay between the gut microbiome and serum metabolites is significantly less straightforward compared to that observed with fecal metabolites, as it is likely overshadowed by other physiological processes and systemic metabolic activities. Indeed, the average correlation between features from different omics in this model was lower than those in modules of other datasets, but nonetheless higher than randomly sampled modules (Fig. 2B). Specifically, 19 of 108 correlations between serum metabolites and gut microbiome features in this module were significantly positive (FDR < 0.05; for comparison, in random modules of the same size, less than 1 metabolite-microbiome feature pair was significantly correlated). Of the serum metabolites included in this module, several are well-known signatures of metabolic disorders, including increased glucose, mannose, TCA cycle metabolites (e.g. pyruvic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid), and glutamate. Circulating levels of isoleucine (as well as other BCAA's and BCAA-related metabolites) have also been repeatedly shown to play a role in glucose homeostasis and metabolic syndrome risk. Though some of the other module's metabolites have not been specifically discussed in the context of metabolic disorders, they are all significantly positively correlated with one another (32 of 36 metabolite pairs are positively correlated with an FDR < 0.05), effectively representing a cohesive cluster of metabolites coordinately elevated in MS. Interestingly, in a recent study, several of these metabolites (pyruvic acid, glucose, glutamic acid) were found to be significantly well-predicted by the gut microbiome when measured in feces, but only marginally well-predicted in blood, further strengthening the assumption that the gut microbiome's association with these serum metabolites is likely obscured by additional processes, but nonetheless existent.

Moreover, the inclusion of certain bacterial species in this module along with these metabolites is likely related to their previously reported role in glutamate metabolism and/or BCAA metabolism. Bacteroides dorei/vulgatus, for example, though only marginally significantly increased in MS patients in our dataset (FDR = 0.07), have been shown to impact serum isoleucine levels. B. vulgatus specifically was also reported to take part in glutamate metabolism and further recognized as one of the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs in the gut and insulin resistance. The exact role of B. vulgatus in the development of metabolic disorders, however, remains unclear and is probably context- and strain-dependent, as it has been shown to confer health benefits (including metabolic-related) in some studies, while positively correlating with insulin resistance and body fat in others. Interestingly, B. vulgatus was also reported to induce compositional shifts when administered to rats, specifically promoting an increase in Parabacteroides species that is also included in this module. Parabacteroides mardeae, another species in this module, has also been shown to enhance BCAA catabolism, again with positive health benefits, albeit significantly increased in MS patients in our dataset. Lastly, we note that Bilophila wadsworthia has been mostly discussed in the literature in the context of IBD and colon inflammation, but has also been implicated in metabolic dysfunctions. It was also found to cluster with Clostridium bolteae, another species in the module, in terms of their responses to short and long-term diet, possibly explaining their co-occurrence in this module. As for the pathway features included in this module, likely not all represent specific metabolic functions relevant to MS, but nonetheless exhibit strong correlations with some of the modules' species, suggesting potential dependencies. Overall, we find multiple reports supporting specific links within the module, but the shared role of these bacterial species in MS phenotypes and circulating levels of MS-related metabolites specifically remains elusive.

Importantly, even when analyzing metagenomic-derived features alone (i.e., in the absence of additional omics), MintTea may highlight interesting insights related to associated taxonomic and functional disease biomarkers. In the liver cirrhosis dataset, for example, we found a module (Supplementary Fig. S3A) that included multiple species typically found in the human oral cavity, including several Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Megasphaera species (both commensal and opportunistic pathogens), all of which previously found to be increased in stool samples of individuals with liver diseases, as well as other gastrointestinal disorders. The co-occurrence of multiple Streptococcus and Veillonella species in this module is in line with their strong co-abundance patterns, confirmed across multiple diverse large-scale cohorts, and also with known metabolic interactions between them. Furthermore, several pathways in the module relate to vitamin K metabolism (menaquinol-8 biosynthesis I, menaquinol-11 biosynthesis, 2-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinol biosynthesis, phylloquinol biosynthesis, geranylgeranyl diphosphate biosynthesis), also relevant to liver health. Indeed, several vitamin K forms (including menaquinone) are known to be bacterially produced in the human intestines, with Veillonella parvula specifically reported to produce menaquinones in vitro. In another study, menaquinone biosynthesis was found to be associated with Streptococcus overgrowth in IBD. Additional pathways in the module, e.g. those related to L-methionine and heme b biosynthesis, are also possibly tied to menaquinone metabolism and to Veillonella's specific metabolic activities. L-methionine's role, for example, as a methyl group donor for certain menaquinones biosynthesis has been confirmed in several bacterial species, though not specifically in the species of this module. Also, previous genomic analysis of Veillonella species showed that they harbour complete gene sets for heme biosynthesis. Overall, this module suggests a potential multi-layer vitamin k-related and oral bacteria-driven mechanism that is highly associated with liver damage. Supplementary Fig. S3 further illustrates two additional multi-omic modules associated with IBD, as additional examples.

Multi-omic modules across diverse cohorts

Having shown that MintTea can identify multi-omic modules exhibiting associations both across omics and with a disease, we finally sought to detect prevalent and recurring multi-omic modules shared across diverse datasets. Due to the substantial technical and methodological differences between the multi-omic datasets analyzed, which render cross-study comparisons impractical, here we focused on shotgun data only, where both taxonomic and functional (pathway-level) profiles were generated uniformly by the curatedMetagneomicData resource. Specifically, we utilized the 3 datasets, previously presented, from the curatedMetagonmicData resource (i.e., the CRC, Cirrhosis, and STH datasets; Fig. 1C), as well as 11 additional datasets from the same resource (Supplementary Data File S1; Methods), totaling 14 uniformly processed datasets. After applying MintTea to these datasets (Supplementary Fig. S4; Supplementary Data Files S3 and S4), we quantified the overlaps between modules from the different datasets and disease states, and identified significant overlaps (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Data File S7; Methods). Of the 43 consensus module pairs with an overlap of at least 2 features, 10 exhibited a statistically significant overlap (Fisher's exact test, FDR-corrected p value < 0.1), suggesting prevalent multi-omic associations between microbiome features.

We additionally identified specific bacterial species that appeared in multiple modules of different datasets. Bacteroides uniformis, for example -- a gram-negative, fiber-degrading, highly abundant commensal in the human gastrointestinal tract -- appeared in modules of 5 different datasets (Fig. 3B). Other species commonly appearing with B. uniformis in MintTea modules were also from the Bacteroides genus, including B. xylanivsolvens, B. ovatus, and B. thetaiotaomicron. Interestingly, B. uniformis tended to appear with vitamin B-related pathways such as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis pathways (the active form of vitamin B6) and thiamine (vitamin B1) diphosphate synthesis. Indeed, B. uniformis genomes, as well as the other Bacteroides genomes, are known to have a relatively high coverage of biosynthetic pathways for multiple vitamins, including B-vitamins. Furthermore, in a previous study, we found that the Bacteroides genus is significantly and consistently correlated with fecal Pyridoxamine levels (a form of vitamin B6), based on a meta-analysis of 5 different datasets in which both this genus and this metabolite were detected. Though this analysis was done at the genus level only, we also know that B. uniformis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B.ovatus (all of which shown in Fig. 3C) are among the most prevalent Bacteroides species in adults. Lastly, examining the taxon-stratified outputs of HUMAnN3, we observed that B. uniformis was one of the top contributors of reads assigned to these vitamin B-related pathways, further explaining their co-occurrence in the same modules. B. uniformis was also a top contributor to other pathways that co-appeared with it across modules from diverse datasets, including 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis I and lipid IV biosynthesis (which is part of the biosynthesis process of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a crucial component of bacterial outer membrane). Taken together, these modules suggest a common axis of variation shared between multiple cohorts and characterized mainly by Bacteroides species and metabolic processes essential for cell survival, including biosynthesis of several cofactors and LPS.

Noticing the tendency described above of species from the Bacteroides genus to co-occur in modules, we conducted a permutation-based analysis to test whether species in MintTea modules are indeed significantly more likely to appear with other species from their respective genus, compared to random modules. We confirmed this was indeed a general trend (22.8% compared to 12.7% [7.7-18.6%], p value: 0.001). This observation is in line with the hypothesis that phylogenetically related species are more likely to compete for a shared niche, and, accordingly present stronger co-occurrence patterns.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2862745098039217,448894035,1,https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46888-3/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46888_Fig1_HTML.png,

(Friday, March 22, 2024) - Here's a familiar phrase to NTT INDYCAR SERIES drivers, teams and fans: Alex Palou appears to be the driver to beat this weekend.

Reigning NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Palou, who earned a series-high five victories last season en route to his second title in the last three years, led both sessions Friday on the first day of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES Open Test at The Thermal Club near Palm Springs, California.

Palou's best overall lap of 1 minute, 39.3373 seconds came in the hotter, three-hour afternoon session in the No. 10 DHL Chip Ganassi Racing Honda. Two-time series champion Palou also led the two-hour morning session with a lap of 1:39.5149 on the 17-turn, 3.067-mile circuit.

Usually, the biggest payoff of testing is valuable data for engineers and track knowledge for drivers. But there's more at stake this weekend - a lot more.

Qualifying Saturday will divide the 27-driver field for two heat races Sunday. Those 10-lap heat races will whittle the field to 12 drivers for the 20-lap Sprint for the Purse non-points special event, with the winner of that race claiming $500,000. The 20-lap dash for cash will be divided into two 10-lap segments.

Live coverage of the heat races and Sprint for the Purse starts at 12:30 p.m. ET Sunday on NBC, Peacock and the INDYCAR Radio Network.

""It was good,"" Palou said. ""Tire (degradation) is pretty high here, but it's the same for everybody. Hopefully, that's going to make the race very, very interesting.

""We want to focus on the race this weekend, but at the same time it's an opportunity to take today and tomorrow morning as test days. It's good. It's exciting.""

Testing will continue from noon-2 p.m. ET and 4-6 p.m. Saturday. Qualifying for the two heat races, divided into two groups at a draw Thursday night, starts at 8 p.m. ET Saturday. Peacock and the INDYCAR Radio Network will cover all track action live Saturday.

The three drivers closest to Palou on Friday each turned their best laps in the cooler morning conditions.

Christian Lundgaard ended up second overall at 1:39.6974 in the No. 45 Hy-Vee Honda fielded by Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Marcus Armstrong put two CGR drivers in the top three with his best lap of 1:39.7313 in the No. 11 Ridgeline Lubricants Chip Ganassi Racing Honda. Alexander Rossi was fourth and the quickest Chevrolet-powered driver at 1:39.7556 in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren entry.

Felix Rosenqvist continued his strong early-season resurgence by ending up fifth at 1:39.7802 in the No. 60 AutoNation/SiriusXM Honda fielded by Meyer Shank Racing. That was the second-quickest lap of the warmer afternoon session, behind Palou.

All 27 drivers are trying to manage tire wear on the undulating, technical circuit at the base of the Santa Rosa Mountains, especially as teams won't be allowed to change their Firestone Firehawk rubber between the two 10-lap segments of the Sprint for the Purse without INDYCAR approval for emergency service.

""With the high tire (degradation), it should make for some good racing on Sunday,"" Andretti Global driver Marcus Ericsson said. ""We will see, especially on the 20-lap race when we have one set of tires. That's going to be tough to keep your car underneath you, so I think that will create some good racing.""",speedwaymedia.com,news,Speedway Media,,0.2862745098039217,448893095,1,https://speedwaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Palou-Paces-Both-Sessions-of-Open-Test-Friday-at-Thermal-e1711196711183.jpg,

Understanding shopper responses towards integration activtites in omnichannel retailing,"Sammanfattning: Contemporary shopper journeys often entail myriad interactions, including online or offline stores, smartphone applications, social media platforms and mass communication. Shoppers typically expect to shop seamlessly across interactions, leading retailers to develop omnichannel strategies focused on integrating such interactions. This thesis investigates shopper responses, linked to sales- and brand-related outcomes, towards these integration attempts, seeking to determine if these responses are dependent on four distinct aspects in the shopping situation: type of purchase made by the shopper, how well-planned the purchase is, the shopper's smartphone shopping expertise and the location of the shopper. The shopping behavior literature suggests that shoppers respond differently towards marketing, depending on their shopping situation. However, a common belief in both omnichannel research and practice is that integration across interactions is preferable in all situations. This thesis contributes to research and practice by examining if and when shopper responses towards retailers' integration activities can be dependent upon the shopping situation. The empirical results from five articles consisting of eight experimental studies indicate that a one-size-fits-all integration strategy is not universally applicable. The overall patterns demonstrate that retailers will gain more by focusing on integration activities targeted towards shoppers who purchase utilitarian products, make planned purchases, have less experience in using their smartphone while shopping, and are located outside the store. The findings can be used as a guide for retailers in the design of their integration activities.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.03529411764705892,448891145,1,,

Here's how Kia takes the crown for 2024.

Summary

The 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid is a budget-friendly SUV that still offers a great powertrain and fuel economy, making it perfect for families. Kia's approach to offering affordably priced SUVs has positioned it ahead of competitors, like Toyota and Ford, with the Niro leading the charge. Combining ample headroom and legroom with stylish design and fuel efficiency, the 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid is a top choice for budget-conscious buyers.

With 2024 well underway and the world of hybrid SUVs booming, there are quite a few options for this year. Whether you prefer something sporty, futuristic, elegant, big, or small, the hybrid car segment is one of the fastest-growing. In recent times, auto manufacturers have prioritized SUV models, with the subcompact genre of design being the most affordable.

Considering most hybrids cost more than regular ICE models, it's worth finding one that fits your budget without compromising. Certain brands do a better job of making cheap cars, trucks, and SUVs, with this becoming even truer for 2024. Kia and Toyota have been head-to-head in the battle for the most affordable SUV, with Kia slowly inching its way to the finish line.

The 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid is your most 'affordable' model for this year, beating the Corolla Cross Hybrid by a few thousand dollars. This model retails for a surprising $26,940 and is a great option for those wanting a standard hybrid powertrain, great fuel economy, spacious interior, and nice-feeling interior details. \

Although at the lower end of its class, this SUV doesn't feel like a compromise. It's also perfect for families, as it seats five with ample headroom and legroom. No matter where you go, this SUV is sleek, safe, comfortable, and, most importantly, AFFORDABLE. Keep reading below to learn more about it!

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Kia and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and Car and Driver.

The 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid Is The Most Affordable Hybrid SUV

Close

Although we've known Toyota to make the cheapest cars, trucks, and SUVs for quite a while, the 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid is taking center stage. Not only is this model a couple of thousand dollars cheaper than the Corolla Cross Hybrid (MSRP of $28,220), but it's also super nice for what you're paying.

With spacious interiors, nice materials, a redesigned exterior, excellent fuel economy, and gleaming reviews from verified shoppers, this SUV is a great starter choice for a growing family.

At a comfortable $26,940, the 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid is not only a cleaner way to drive but also a part of the brand's broader goal towards full electrification. You have a plug-in hybrid and EV version of the nameplate, so there is quite a bit of battery power to go around.

Under $27,000 To Start

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of this SUV, it's worth mentioning the price point and how it compares to other similar vehicles in its class. First, the all-new 2024 edition of Niro sees a comfortable price tag of $26,940, which would get you into an LX trim. Moving up, you see the EX, EX Touring, SX, and SX Touring, topping off at $35,340. Again, even at $35,000, this SUV remains one of the lowest priced on the market.

For context, a brand-new Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid retails for over $28,000, and a Kia Sportage Hybrid starts at $28,590. Your next most comparable SUV is a Ford Escape Hybrid, retailing for $29,495. Kia Niro blows them out of the water.

Gas Mileage Galore: Here's How Kia Niro Hybrid Performs

One of the many reasons we love this SUV is its city and highway MPG ratings. According to the EPA, this year's Kia Niro Hybrid has a rating of 53/45 city/highway and a combined rating of 49 miles per gallon. You can also expect to get two gallons of gas out of every 100 miles driven, making this one of your best choices for fuel economy this year.

Although the EPA has not released its five-year fuel savings prediction for this model, you can expect to spend less time and money at the station. Typically, SUVs don't exceed the 30 combined MPG marker, even as hybrids, so this model is a winner in that department.

Compact Exterior Without Compromise

One of the reasons the 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid has amazing fuel economy is that it's a more subcompact size: 174 inches long, 72 inches wide, and 61 inches high. With these dimensions, you see a smaller sizing compared to a Telluride, even though inside the vehicle, it doesn't feel cramped.

Many people compliment this model's headroom, legroom, and shoulder space, even with four or five people inside. It's not every day you find an SUV that's stylish, comfy, and under $30,000 as a hybrid. Kia is hitting the ground running with this series.

Specs, Specs, And More Specs!

When it comes to what you get inside and outside the 2024 Kia Niro Hybrid SUV, there are many reasons to get excited. First, the interior of this model sees base specs like a six-way manual driver and passenger seat, 60/40 rear folding seats, an eight-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, solar control glass, sound-absorbing windshield glass, comfortable cloth seats, and nice trim and detailing throughout the main cabin.

Outside this SUV, you have the following specs:

The Kia Niro Hybrid Brings A Lot To The Table

Not only has Kia made waves in the electric industry, but it is also chomping away at brands like Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and Honda in the hybrid department. Because Kia is undergoing a rebrand in North America to be greener, nicer, and more affordable, we're seeing buyers flock to models like the Niro SUV.

Whether you need something big enough to fit your kids, your pets, your things, or just love the look of a compact SUV model, this hybrid is worth a second (or third). Hybrid models continue to gain attention from eco-conscious buyers, especially because you can still rely on gas. Let's face it, not everybody is ready for electric-only cars, trucks, and SUVs. Some people may want to slowly transition into EVs, with hybrids and PHEVs being the perfect solution.

If Kia can continue this downward trend in price and upward trend in quality, we could see the South Korean auto brand take the hybrid industry altogether. After all, there's nothing we love more than a shake-up in the industry.

Off To The Future, We Go

Because Kia has been adamant about making seven EVs by 2027, it's clear the brand is shifting focus from gas/ICE manufacturing to hybrid, PHEV, and full EV powertrains. As of 2024, you have a nice range of hybrid models to select from, including the affordable Niro. Kia has slowly begun to only offer hybrid models, so even at a base level, you save on emissions and trips to the pump.

With many SUVs in the ranks of most affordable, plus cars and EVs receiving gleaming feedback from critics and customers, we're witnessing the Renaissance of Kia. You're not only thinking about the hamsters inside a Soul anymore (although they are iconic) but eco-friendly, thoughtful design across this Korean brand's lineup.",topspeed.com,news,Top Speed,Noah Staats,0.06666666666666665,448888898,1,https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/18668_2023_niro-1.jpg,eng-9421284

Prof. Pate who stated this while presenting the keynote address at the 6th Afe Babalola University Multi-System Hospital (AMSH) anniversary lecture with the theme"" Achieving Universal Health Coverage Through Mental Health Service Integration,"" also lamented low knowledge of mental health among Nigerians.

Represented by the National Coordinator of the National Mental Health Programme, Dr. Tunde Ojo, the minister also said that the Federal Government is addressing mental health needs of Nigerians.

While noting that just one factor cannot be responsible for mental health issue he listed, he added that other strategies as integrated approach to care, public /private partnership, incentive creation, integration of mental health issues in other sectors policies and programmes, among others.

Prof Pate further express worries about the low level of mental health literacy in the country.

""People have wrong notions about what are the causes of mental health condition and where they can get treatment. There is the need to educate and sensitize people about what mental health is, and it's not just about disease, but what we can do to enhance our mental health. I believe that will go a long way in improving mental health of Nigerians,"" the minister said.

Ojo, on behalf of the minister stated that everybody has mental health from a combination of biological, psychological, social and factors.

""Unemployment, socio-economic, family factors and a whole of things could be responsible for the development of health issues. A whole lots come together.

""So, if people have those with mental health condition in their family, they can have tendency of developing it also, but that does not necessarily mean that they will develop it,"" Pate added.

He added that the Federal Government is doing quite a lot to address mental health needs of Nigerians by integrating other sectors aside from the health.

""We have a national mental health policy that everyone including state actors, state government can take up on. It is a document that has something for everybody to be able to address mental health of Nigerians. We also have the national suicide prevention strategic framework.

""All of us know that, there have been report of rising cases of suicide. But what can we do as a country or as organisation to be able to prevent suicide because it can be prevented.

""We have that document. We all know before now that there is a Lunacy Act that talks about the right of people with mental health. This is a very archaic one. Again, the Federal Government in 2022 passed the National Mental Health Act which speaks against the violation of rights of people with mental health condition.

""The abuse of rights of such people. They go to traditional settings and religious homes in trying to get care. But what happen is that they violate their rights by being beaten, chained and, some female victims go for such treatment, only to come home with pregnancy. These are no solutions. These are human beings that have their rights to dignity and their rights must be protected,"" the minister said.

He explained that government has made the legal and policy framework available, adding that it is now left for the the stakeholders to promote mental health.

The Chief Medical Director of AMSH, Dr Kolawole Ogundipe recalled that six years down the line, the hospital has continued to experience unprecedented growth and achieved incredible feats, while offering cutting-edge services in all aspects of medicine.

Also, the Vice Chancellor, Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), Prof Smaranda Olarinde said apart from providing medical services, the hospital also engaged in research and training of both undergraduates medical and allied students.

And it turns out I am that lunatic ...

It is November. It is 3am and I am lying awake listening to the sound of rats chewing the electrical wires within the walls of my house. If you've ever heard mice or rats scuttling around in the walls, you'll know how annoying it can be. Imagine that, but with the rats separated from your head by only a slice of MDF. The scratching and gnawing is so loud, I can't get back to sleep.

Last night I spent the evening convincing my children that the noise is just a family of squirrels who have made a nest on our roof. We try to be kind to all creatures, here on our off-grid farm. There is something about rats, however, that triggers my panic response. Not least because Google research has told me that rats like to chew the insulation around electrical wires as a way to sharpen their teeth. So while the electrics might continue to function, this would come with an increased risk of sudden fire.

How had the rats got in? Well, first I should explain what my house actually is, and how we ended up living here. For the last three years I have been living off-grid. First in a caravan and now in a tiny house that is seven metres long, two and a half metres wide, and just tall enough to squeeze in two loft-style bedrooms under a roof decked with solar panels. A tiny house is in effect a well-built caravan. It's a heavily insulated, A-rated building with triple-glazed windows. There is an air source heat pump, but no connection to the electricity grid. Despite weighing six tonnes, the house sits on a wheeled trailer, which means planning permission rules are more relaxed. Water comes from a 1,000-litre tank on a pile of pallets at the back of the house. Soon this will be fed from rainwater harvested from the roof, but for now it comes along a hosepipe from a tap in the next field. Wastewater goes into a wetland I dug with a spade and filled with gravel. Toilet waste is composted.

There is a growing movement of tiny-house owners in the US, where there are thought to be about 10,000 of them. But mine is in the corner of three acres of farmland in rural Essex, England. For the last 20 or 30 years, rabbits, deer and kestrels have ruled this field. When I moved here it was three acres of nettles, brambles and thistles. Being here is part of my attempt to live sustainably and experiment with all the different ways that an individual can help save the planet and humanity from the polycrisis of the climate emergency, pollution, deforestation and extractive capitalism.

Living off-grid is mad. You'd have to be a lunatic to choose to do it. And, it turns out, I am that lunatic.

Towards the end of the coronavirus pandemic, the world gave me an opportunity to look at all the elements of my life and change them. By which I mean I went through a separation, then divorce. So many people grumble along in vaguely unhappy situations simply because that's what they have always done. But sometimes life forces us to reassess our choices. To step out of the groove we have made for ourselves.

For 10 years or so, I had been worrying about climate change and the environment. My awakening had come when I was living in a flat in south London, but spending most of my time travelling around the world performing my children's comedy show. I flew back and forth across the Atlantic a dozen times, went to Australia four times and New Zealand twice. I was definitely using up more than my fair share of humanity's carbon budget. My diet was terrible. I was living on microwave meals, takeaways and cocktails. I knew something was wrong.

One day I was given a copy of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's first River Cottage Cookbook. I devoured it and swiftly realised my future would involve living in the countryside, doing my best to be self-sufficient. First, I had to find a way to grow some food. The problem was I didn't have any soil, just a tiny garden covered in concrete. One night, as I came home from a late-night comedy gig, I found a bathtub in the street. I dragged it home and somehow manoeuvred it into the garden. The next day I bought compost. It took a few trips but eventually there was enough to plant potatoes. I was amazed when along came the best I'd ever eaten.

From that point on, every time I moved, I acquired a bigger garden. I got out of London into Essex. The bath was replaced with veg beds and fruit trees. The thing was, though, that the houses got bigger and bigger, too. And the cars. And the carbon footprint. At my most bloated, I lived with my family in a five-bedroom house.

So back again to the divorce. I found myself in a position where I was able to really think about how I wanted to live. I had always felt happier in smaller spaces. I loved camping. I loved having to make conscious choices about what I actually needed. I spend a lot of time backpacking around Scotland. If you're carrying it all, you don't pack unnecessary items.

The decision I made was to buy a caravan and live off-grid. It wasn't a fancy static caravan but a modest four-berth tourer. It was about 30 years old and cost me £2,000. I put a solar panel on top, wired an inverter into the electrics and installed a wood-burning stove. I lived in this on a friend's campsite in Suffolk. My kids - now eight and 17 - would stay every other weekend and, yes, it was a squash and a squeeze. I will always remember my daughter in a tin bath in front of the fire. And tripping over my son's legs to get to the other end of the van.

After a year I was given the chance to move my caravan to an unused field. It was covered in thistles and gnarly old nettles that bit like ferrets. There was an old orchard in one corner, so I cleared out a space and put the caravan under a plum tree. This became my new home as I slowly scythed out thistles and planted new trees and vegetable beds. After a year, my new partner and I decided to invest in a tiny house.

I could have bought a frame and filled in the rest myself, with the help of tradespeople. But we decided to go for the luxury end. We found a British company that would deliver the whole house on a lorry. All you had to do was switch it on, they said. It cost £65,000.

I would love to write that the house was great when it arrived in October 2022. Unfortunately, it turned out the people who built it didn't seem to know anything about living off-grid, or electricity, or how to tell the truth. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. I wondered if maybe we had just been unlucky with our house. Then I decided that maybe they were incompetent - well-meaning but out of their depth. My conclusion now, though, is that their business is a malignant attempt to make money out of greenwashing innocent people.

There were so many problems. The house that was delivered was not the house in the brochure. We had ordered a pitched roof, so that solar panels would be pointed at the winter sun. The house that arrived had a pretty much flat roof.

At first, none of the electrics worked. They didn't know why. The house sat empty for a month until they flew some people over from Latvia to fix it. That's right, Latvia. On the company's website they were very proud to state they are a British construction company. We thought the house would be made in England. Turns out it was made in Latvia, then trucked across Europe. Suddenly the carbon footprint wasn't looking so dainty.

It was eventually worked out that the house simply wasn't designed to be off-grid. The inverter and batteries had been fixed to the outside, where they got wet in the rain. Add to this the company's failure to safely earth the house and we could easily have been killed. They also had no idea how many electrical appliances an off-grid system can power. They had installed an electric hob and oven; every time we switched the oven on, the entire house blew a fuse.

There followed a year of people flying to and from Latvia; of us being given impossible instructions as to how to fix the problems ourselves (at one point I did a QR code scan on the inverter, which said it was a socket set); and being told all the problems were my fault because I obviously didn't understand how the house worked. We quickly got to the point where we asked them to take it away and give us our money back. They refused. We looked at suing them for mis-selling. Our solicitor reported they were in so much debt that if we did and won, they would go bankrupt and we would get nothing.

So we did our best to forgive them and try to find a way to make things work. They agreed to pay a UK-based company to replace the solar power system with something that actually worked, and switched the oven and hob for gas ones to take the load off the electrics.

One day, in the middle of all this, I heard a big crack, like a whip or a bolt of lightning. I walked around the house to discover a colony of bees. On fire. A hole had been left where the old inverter had been screwed into the wall. Some bees had moved in and made a nest around the exposed cable; when they connected the circuit with their bodies, a fault electrocuted them to death and set them alight. If a person had touched that 240V wire, it would have killed them.

Once the electrics were finally sorted, we were able to revel in such luxuries as switching on the hot water. It soon became apparent, though, that water was dripping from the underside of the house. There was a leak.

Three separate plumbers came, and one cut access hatches under the house to get at the plumbing. It transpired that the people who had built the house hadn't actually connected the washing machine and shower to the outlet drain. All the greywater was flooding into the insulation in the floor of the house.

This took them two months to address and, of course, required them to fly another team from Latvia to replace the bathroom. In the meantime, no one had thought to close up the access hatch made by the plumber. And that was how the rats got in.

Even at the best of times, the tiny-house life is not easy. Moving there from a regular house posed many transitionary challenges. First, I had to get rid of 90% of my stuff. If I hadn't used something for a year, it went to a charity shop or the tip. When you live in a tiny house you also have to ask yourself, ""Where would I keep it?"" If an item has nowhere to go, there's no point buying it.

The hardest thing to let go off was my books. I've always had a lot of books. A lot of us do. We tend to see them as a way of showing other people who we are. I decided to make the mental switch to realising that by keeping books I'd already read, I was depriving someone else of reading them. So 90% of those went to the charity shop. I now have one small shelf with maybe 50 books on it. Most are hard-to-replace reference books about permaculture and growing food sustainably.

Because there are no solid walls between the sleeping lofts and the rest of the house, I definitely know if someone is snoring. Practically speaking, we are all in the same room, but I think this brings us together emotionally. The concept of a child having their own room is quite a new one. Some people might say making a child separate from their parents at night isn't healthy. I suppose it depends on your philosophies of parenting. I'm very keen on closeness and cuddling, and it helps me to hear my children breathing as they sleep.

Winter can be tough in a tiny house. All that outside space - gold dust for a child - becomes irrelevant. Everything has to be done inside. And that can get a bit claustrophobic. We go to the cinema, the library and the swimming pool much more in the winter. There's nothing wrong, though, with accepting the tilt of the Earth and quietening down in the darker months. We don't have a TV, but the children watch whatever is on iPlayer on my laptop and we snuggle in closely.

This isn't a rich person's hobby project, by the way. I'm not a trustafarian playing hippies. I was brought up in a single-parent family on a council estate, in a house where the walls were so thin, we could hear our neighbours talking in their kitchen. We had moved there to escape an awful situation. That council house was tiny, yet it was more than enough for us. There was no central heating but the open fire in the lounge also heated the water. I was very happy, even though life was hard sometimes. I have memories of the man from the Co-op coming round to collect his £1 for the life assurance and the three of us hiding behind the sofa because we didn't have the money.

Those years gave me a sense that living within my means was a good idea, even though it took until middle age to work out its significance to me. We western humans seem to have convinced ourselves that things that were once luxuries are now necessities. We spend so much time spending money we don't have to buy things we don't need to impress people we don't like.

This winter, though, there was simply not enough electricity to power everything. When the days are shorter and the sun lower, there's not much energy for the panels. There is a petrol generator but unfortunately the house won't connect with it and - surprise! - the manufacturers don't know how to fix this problem.

Living with not quite enough electricity for three months a year means choices have to be made. The low-wattage stuff is fine. There is always plenty of power for the internet, lighting and charging devices. The big watt-gobblers are appliances that heat or move: the immersion heater, shower pump, toaster, fridge-freezer.

There have been plenty of days this winter when I've had just enough sunshine to get the water hot enough for a shower, but not enough to pump it to the shower. As a children's author, I visit two or three primary schools a week and it's important to turn up looking reasonably clean. Sometimes a cold shower is the only option.

I switched the fridge off back in November when I accepted there wasn't going to be a working generator and I was going to have to tighten my electrical belt. Luckily, as the days got shorter and the battery level sank, it got colder outside and I could use a plastic box on the front step to keep my food cool. It helps that I choose a plant-based diet. Not a lot of my food needs refrigerating. In the middle of February, there was finally enough sunlight to switch the fridge back on. I can now eat hummus without sniffing it first - at least until next November, when I'll switch the fridge off again.

Now, the rats have gone, the electricity works and there are no leaks. The next stage is to buy extra solar panels to go on the front of the house, so maybe next winter I'll be able to have hot showers and a working fridge. I can smell spring in the air. The fruit trees are ready to blossom, the wrens are singing.

In January we had a tree-planting party and more than 40 people came. Thankfully, the weather was nice but in the invitation I explained that there would be no inside space. The night before, I forgot to check the plugs and left my son's iPad charging overnight. This almost completely drained the battery and meant there was no hot water until after people started arriving. But my Uncle Stephen lit and maintained a fire pit outside, which gave everyone a focal point to sit round and keep warm. We told stories and laughed. I also managed to feed everyone soup from pumpkins grown in the field. And planted 200 trees, of course.

Do I regret getting into the whole tiny-house nightmare? Of course not. I wish we'd used a different company, or built our own from scratch, but I adore the off-grid life. The best thing is that I am now much more conscious of how I live and what resources I use. And awareness is transformational. The important thing for me is to take action - and to spread the word. Despite the hardships, the rats and the flaming bees, I'm the happiest I've ever been.",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,,-0.1764705882352942,448888086,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70cf75b84b46d19711e69b9077cb2245cb58b02e/0_700_9087_5454/master/9087.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d293f6a2160ca45d3e76567b8a329a17,

Ford is one automaker reaping the benefits, with demand for its Maverick truck spiking. ""Hybrids now have very few compromises compared to their gas alternatives,"" Ford's Andrew Frick said.

It's shaping up to be a comeback year for hybrid cars -- and that's partly because they're now nearly as good as their conventional vehicles, according to a Ford executive.

""Hybrids now have very few compromises compared to their gas alternatives,"" Andrew Frick, head of Ford's the Detroit automaker's gas and hybrid vehicle division, told The Wall Street Journal this week.

Hybrids have a traditional engine that charges batteries to power one or more electric motors, which makes them more efficient than gas-only vehicles. Many do not need to be plugged in like EVs, although some models can also be charged like one.

Frick's comments come as demand for hybrid vehicles soars, partly due to drivers' worries about charging electric cars. Those concerns have dented sales of EVs in recent months.

Another benefit of hybrids is that they're a lot cheaper than their fully electric rivals. Buyers were paying $42,500 on average for hybrids in late 2023, according to data from Edmunds, compared with $60,500 for EVs and $47,500 for gas cars.

Cox Automotive expects 14% of the 15.7 million new vehicles sold in the US this year to be hybrids, higher than the 10% market share for EVs. There are about 70 hybrid models to choose from and they're often significantly cheaper than electric cars.

Hybrid car sales growth in January was five times that of EVs, according to data from Morgan Stanley, with Ford emerging as one of the major beneficiaries of that trend.

Sales of Ford hybrids jumped 37% in the first two months of 2024, with the hybrid version of the Maverick pickup truck leading the charge.

Freedom of choice

The hybrid Maverick starts at about $25,300 -- some $1,500 more than the gas version. About 60% of those buying a hybrid Maverick are first-time Ford customers, product development operations chief Jim Baumbick previously told Business Insider. That's far higher than the figure for other models.

""I know that hybrids will play a role for an extended time,"" he said. ""For us, the freedom of choice and democratizing the technology for customers to select what's best for how they live their lives is really important.""

Ford also added more hybrid options to the F-150 model range for 2024.

Toyota, which pioneered hybrids with the Prius, has also benefited. The Japanese carmaker reported an 84% increase in hybrid and EV sales in February and recently topped a poll of the brands most considered by EV buyers -- even though it only sells one fully electric car.

In November Toyota said the Camry will only be available as a hybrid from 2025. The model has been America's best-selling car for more than two decades.

This week the White House gave automakers more time to ramp up EV sales following pressure from the industry and unions.

The Environmental Protection Agency issued the strictest limits to date on tailpipe pollution from vehicles sold between 2027 and 2032. They could see EVs claim a share of up to 56% of new car sales -- a big jump from 7.6% in 2023.

This innovative robot operates autonomously anywhere in the world thanks to the satellite coverage of the 'Starlink' network and does so by running solely on renewable electricity.

Arbórea Intellbird, which provides services for the digital inspection of Iberdrola's wind turbine blades, was promoted through Iberdrola's start-up programme - PERSEO - for eight years with the aim of promoting its development and consolidating it in the sector. On this occasion, the company has gone a step further and has developed this new platform for autonomous inspection of solar plants.

This platform makes it possible to generate an inspection process in search of thermal anomalies, not only in the upper part of the panels, as drones do, but also, in the case of the Antecursor II, simultaneously in all their lower structures, such as clips, fuse holders, clamps or wiring, which escape aerial view.

The robot's inspection autonomy far exceeds that of any other system, at over 30 hours. This allows inspections of the photovoltaic infrastructure to be carried out without requiring the intervention of any human operator. This is achieved thanks to a set of high-resolution thermographic sensors that continuously take thousands of measurements of the installation every second. This large mass of digital data is processed on board by an AI process, also patented by Arbórea, based on a combination of hardware and intelligent software developed by the company. The system detects anomalies, evaluates them based on plant conditions and reports early identification of potential hot spots, all in real time. As a result, the technicians of the company that owns the installation receive an e-mail on their mobile phones with the alert, the position of the anomaly and a thermography with the reference values.

To do this, the robot continuously and regularly visits the installation, monitoring the correct operation of the panels and the electrical circuit, processing the information on board, detecting anomalies and automatically reporting any value that could lead to deterioration of the elements.

Continuous remote monitoring of the robot's vital signs allows any irregularities to be detected early and all systems to be continuously updated, no matter how remote the location in which they operate.

In addition, Antecursor II has an integrated vegetation clearing system based on aeronautical materials to generate a fine mulching of the vegetation, which is done cleanly and very quietly. This 100% electric vegetation management avoids soil contamination by oils or fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, the risk of fire associated with hot engines or the breakage of panels due to the projection of stones from traditional disc or filament brushcutting systems. This continuous autonomous cutting encourages the growth of ground cover species, thus achieving greater control of dust, which is so harmful when deposited on the panels. The generation of a layer of basal vegetation avoids desertification by runoff and favours the maintenance of living soils and therefore the maintenance of biodiversity in the photovoltaic plants.",atalayar.com,news,Atalayar,,0.2705882352941176,448888014,1,https://www.atalayar.com/media/atalayar/images/2024/03/19/2024031911424068250.jpg,

The port hopes this will point the way to it becoming a transit hub for heavy wind turbine parts.

The turbines are destined for the Sopi-Tootsi wind farm in Pärnu County, a project which is not only the largest in the country by area but also marks the first time such turbines of these proportions have been erected in Estonia, ETV news show ""Aktuaalne kaamera"" (AK) reported Friday.

So far, the port facilities have been able accommodate all the components though there have been some delays experienced in their transit, and the port's capacity may soon be full.

The parts also come from a variety of different areas of the world.

Üllar Raad, CEO of Esteve, the logistics firm involved in the project, told AK: ""The core technical components, including the motor and electricity generator, have come from Europe: Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark.""

""However, the larger parts, such as the blades, are brought from Indonesia, while we have also received parts from India and China. The towers similarly are from India.""

Construction is underway at Tootsi, Pärnumaa, with nearly half of the components for the planned 38 turbines having already arrived in port in Paldiski (over 100 kilometers north of Tootsi).

While no further major wind farms are currently earmarked for construction in Estonia, the port hopes it can be a transit point for similar projects in Latvia and Lithuania, too.

Janek Lillemägi, senior project manager for wind energy at Enefit Green, said: ""The blades will be placed at a height of 170 meters on the tower, giving a total height of 240 meters.

Due to security considerations, the parties involved say they cannot reveal when and via which route the turbine components will begin their journey to Pärnu County, though it is certain that the transportation will take place at night - something which presents a major logistical challenge and will entail long, slow-moving convoys on the route south.

At Paldiski itself, next year, a new, 10-hectare quay intended for servicing offshore wind farms is to be completed.

According to Üllar Raad, the difference in size between onshore and offshore turbines is colossal.

Offshore wind farm turbine blades are nearly double the dimensions of their onshore counterparts at up to1 50 meters, while blades of up to 200 meters in length are likely to arrive in due course, Raad said.

A wind turbine tower weighs around 100 tonnes, and, again, towers of three times that mass may be developed in future.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,,0.0117647058823529,448887419,1,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/03/22/2319210hd799t24.png,eng-9420920

It's shaping up to be a comeback year for hybrid cars -- and that's partly because they're now nearly as good as their conventional vehicles, according to a Ford executive.

""Hybrids now have very few compromises compared to their gas alternatives,"" Andrew Frick, head of Ford's the Detroit automaker's gas and hybrid vehicle division, told The Wall Street Journal this week.

Hybrids have a traditional engine that charges batteries to power one or more electric motors, which makes them more efficient than gas-only vehicles. Many do not need to be plugged in like EVs, although some models can also be charged like one.

Frick's comments come as demand for hybrid vehicles soars, partly due to drivers' worries about charging electric cars. Those concerns have dented sales of EVs in recent months.

Another benefit of hybrids is that they're a lot cheaper than their fully electric rivals. Buyers were paying $42,500 on average for hybrids in late 2023, according to data from Edmunds, compared with $60,500 for EVs and $47,500 for gas cars.

Cox Automotive expects 14% of the 15.7 million new vehicles sold in the US this year to be hybrids, higher than the 10% market share for EVs. There are about 70 hybrid models to choose from and they're often significantly cheaper than electric cars.

Hybrid car sales growth in January was five times that of EVs, according to data from Morgan Stanley, with Ford emerging as one of the major beneficiaries of that trend.

Sales of Ford hybrids jumped 37% in the first two months of 2024, with the hybrid version of the Maverick pickup truck leading the charge.

The hybrid Maverick starts at about $25,300 -- some $1,500 more than the gas version. About 60% of those buying a hybrid Maverick are first-time Ford customers, product development operations chief Jim Baumbick previously told Business Insider. That's far higher than the figure for other models.

""I know that hybrids will play a role for an extended time,"" he said. ""For us, the freedom of choice and democratizing the technology for customers to select what's best for how they live their lives is really important.""

Ford also added more hybrid options to the F-150 model range for 2024.

Toyota, which pioneered hybrids with the Prius, has also benefited. The Japanese carmaker reported an 84% increase in hybrid and EV sales in February and recently topped a poll of the brands most considered by EV buyers -- even though it only sells one fully electric car.

In November Toyota said the Camry will only be available as a hybrid from 2025. The model has been America's best-selling car for more than two decades.

This week the White House gave automakers more time to ramp up EV sales following pressure from the industry and unions.

The Environmental Protection Agency issued the strictest limits to date on tailpipe pollution from vehicles sold between 2027 and 2032. They could see EVs claim a share of up to 56% of new car sales -- a big jump from 7.6% in 2023.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1450980392156862,448886100,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T9YfqGW0JI3vf4UP1UMSyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/a4686209893bb5daa48c81088e6b64db,eng-9419966

Since its inauguration in 2018, Space Resources Week has become a reference event for the space resources community. For the 2024 edition, hosted at the European Convention Center Luxembourg as well as online, the event will bring together space agencies, thought leaders, scientists and business visionaries in a multidisciplinary forum. The aim is to strengthen the foundation on which the field of space resources is built, align the scientific and commercial needs and capabilities, and collectively develop a sustainable space resources architecture for the future.

The event is organised by the Luxembourg-based European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC) together with the LSA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology (LIST). For the sixth edition, 520 people have registered to join in person, while 600 more are set to follow the event online. A total of 105 speakers will take to the stage and 52 posters will be presented.

""Space Resource Utilisation is a dynamic, vibrant and truly multidisciplinary field, bringing together scientists, engineers, legal experts and established entrepreneurs with a common goal: to enable the sustainable exploration of space. Space Resources Week is a wonderful opportunity for Luxembourg to bring together the community, to facilitate discussion and to once again be the focal point for the community,"" said Kathryn Hadler, Director of ESRIC. ""I am immensely proud that ESRIC, together with its partners, LSA, LIST and ESA, is able to host such an important event in the annual calendar. This year we are particularly pleased to be also hosting the UN Expert Meeting in parallel to Space Resources Week.""

Among the speakers are Luxembourg's Minister of the Economy, SMEs, Energy and Tourism, Lex Delles, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher and ESRIC Director Kathryn Hadler, as well as Daniel Neuenschwander, Director of Human and Robotic Exploration at ESA, Aarti Holla-Maini, Director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), Hiroshi Yamakawa, President of JAXA: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Matthias Maurer, ESA Astronaut and Materials Scientist.

""In-Situ Resource Utilisation is a critical capability for Europe's journey towards greener and more sustainable space exploration. As exploration efforts accelerate, ESA plans to take a leading role in advancing related research and development and supporting European industry in securing a position on the emerging value chain of Space Resources-enabled services and applications,"" emphasises Daniel Neuenschwander, ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration.

With the move to the European Convention Center in Luxembourg-Kirchberg, the audience will be able to discover the work of partner organisations and agencies, such as Gradel, Catapult, Astrostrom, Algoryx, OffWorld, Polimak, Ispace, Sira Space, the UK Space Agency, EURO2MOON and the University of Luxembourg's Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) department.

According to the organisers, the multidisciplinary forum of Space Resources Week would be incomplete without a focus on commercial activities and business. At the end of the first day of the event, Lari Cujko, Start-up Support Programme Lead at ESRIC, will announce the details of the fifth thematic call of the ESRIC Start-up Support Programme (SSP). He will also reveal the ventures starting their pre-incubation journey in April 2024, in the context of the fourth round of the programme.

Taking into account the importance of fostering exchanges that can sustain the future lunar economy, Space Resources Week will also mark the opportunity to celebrate, on the second day, the partnership between the ESRIC and OffWorld Europe as well as, on the third day, the future collaboration with the Bocconi Space Economy Evolution Lab, with the signing of memoranda of understanding (MoUs).

Army Gen. Randy George discussed some of the advancements this morning when talking with Defense One digital media platform in Washington.

""We've all seen how the battlefield is changing, [and] we know that you can't have these big C2 [command and control] nodes that are out there,"" George said. ""We know that machines can do a lot of things right now much more effectively and much cheaper, and we're going to have to incorporate them into our formations.""

George spoke to Defense One after having just returned from observing Project Convergence Capstone 4, an experiment involving the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Space Force. Dubbed PC-C4, the two-phase, joint and multination experiment took place at Camp Pendleton, California, and the Army's National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, from Feb. 23 through March 20.

Led by Army Futures Command, Project Convergence is a series of experiments that gives warfighters the opportunity to experiment with technology at the operational level and further refine methods for synchronizing as a joint force.

""Technology is moving really fast,"" said George, ""and [PC-C4] kind of gave us an opportunity to see just how we could do that.""

As an example of how advanced technology can be integrated into the Army's formations, George explained that he got to observe a light infantry company that was operating in a simulated urban environment while incorporating robotic dogs and unmanned aircraft systems to sense the environment.

""That was all tied together by a very simple command and control network that was easy to use and intuitive,"" said George. ""It was amazing.""

George said that the hands-on approach to innovation during experiments like PC-C4 can be very advantageous when compared to more conventional, top-down innovation.

""I think there's nothing like testing ... in the environments that you know you're going to need to operate in; this isn't about testing something in a showroom,"" remarked the general. ""This is actually getting to use [the technology] where they're going to use it ... and I think that's where we do our best learning.""

In terms of a timeline for integration of modernization capabilities, George said that depends on future budgets, and while there is no specific date or timeline for all modernization, the Army is focused on ""incremental improvement.""

""We do have a sense of urgency,"" he said. ""I think everybody is anxious to transform.""",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.2470588235294118,448883584,1,,

Andy Wightman, a land reform campaigner who previously published data on Scottish land distribution in 2012, has calculated that half of all privately owned rural land in Scotland (equivalent to 3.2m hectares) is held by just 433 people and companies, with only 2.76% held by community groups.

The latest data, as reported by The Guardian, found that hereditary peers own less land than previously, while the number of private investors who specialise in financially lucrative ""green capital"" schemes to create forestry and peat restoration projects has surged.

Wightman's (below) analysis of Land Registry records found that Scotland's third largest landowner is US-owned investment firm Gresham House, which owns 53,775 hectares across 161 separate holdings.

The Duke of Buccleuch - who was Scotland's largest private landowner when Wightman did his last survey in 2012 - placed second, holding 66,345 hectares.

This figure is 32% less than in 2012, as the estate has been voluntarily selling land to local residents.

Scotland's largest landowner is Danish billionaire Anders Povlsen, the largest shareholder in the British online fashion retailer Asos.

He owns 88,296 hectares spread across 12 estates, an increase of 37% since 2012.

Wightman's data has come from records held by Registers of Scotland, the official land register, and more accurate land mass data from Ordnance Survey.

Alongside other land campaigners, he has argued that the latest data is evidence that the Scottish parliament's attempts to empower community buyouts to diversify rural landownership has failed, despite enacting several laws to strengthen right to buy laws and asset transfers.

Despite several significant buyouts, including the sale of 4000 hectares on Langholm Moor to local residents by Buccleuch Estates and the purchase of the island of Ulva off Mull, part-funded with £4.4m from the government-backed Scottish Land Fund, sales of that scale are very rare.

'Scotland has the most concentrated pattern of land ownership in Europe'

Scottish Government figures show the amount of community-owned land has grown by just 40,048 hectares in the last decade, from 172,294 hectares in 2012 to 212,342 hectares.

""Scotland has the most concentrated pattern of land ownership in Europe,"" Wightman told The Guardian.

""There's nothing in the current reforms which will make any substantial change to that. If we're serious about changing that, we need to embrace reforms which will absolutely deliver.""

This publication was told that over 300 broiler chicks were distributed to residents in Tapakuma to assist in the Tapakuma chicken project, while 41 persons received Black Giant chicks in the Lima Sands area and 56 piglets were gifted to Queenstown livestock farmers. Two residents of Zorg-en-Vlygt received Black Belly sheep.

The distribution exercise was held at the Rice Producers Association (RPA) compound and was facilitated by staff of the Guyana Livestock Development Authority (GLDA). Present at the handing over ceremony were Region Two Vice Chairman, Humace Oodit and Prime Minister's Representative, Arnold Adams.

Oodit, in his remarks, said that the residents met with the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture, Madanlall Ramraj and made a number of requests which were immediately addressed to ensure that they could acquire livestock.

He said that it was a fulfilment of the government's promise to the people of various Region Two communities. He said that it was his desire for people to use the opportunity to expand and to become self-sufficient.

Meanwhile, Adams said the government was committed to helping persons in every community in the region. Adams said the government will continue to work with every Region Two community.

""No community will be left behind, every week we have been visiting, listening to your concerns and we are fulfilling our obligations. We made the promises and here today, we are fulfilling those promises,"" Adams said.

Wonda Wong of Queenstown who received a piglet, told this publication that she was overjoyed.

She is hoping to use the animal for breeding purposes.

Wong said that she was very thankful for the 'gift.'

Another beneficiary, Errol Richards, said that he was thankful to the Ministry of Agriculture for the assistance.

Similar sentiments were expressed by farmers who received broilers and sheep.

During the Early Modern Period, grain price volatility was a matter of great concern. The parish magasins were conceived as a substitute for government action intended to stabilize grain prices and offer relief in case of crop failure. The thesis analyzes the problems of harvest variability and grain price fluctuations utilizing both theory and empirical evidence. It is concluded that market integration, especially by permitting imports, was more effective than inter-harvest storage in reducing the likelihood of high prices. Initially the peasants were sceptical of the new institution. Although the establishment of the magasinswas strictly speaking voluntary, substantial hierarchical pressure was applied. Once they had come into existence, however, the magasins evolved into a type of grain bank. The parishioners found them useful as a source of communal revenue at a time of rising need for local public expenditure for education and poor relief. In addition, the failure of the grain market to meet the needs of the peasantry created a demand for loans in kind. Although by no means ideal, in the absence of any superior institutions, themagasins provided valuable services. When improvements in both municipal finance and the functioning of the grain markets occurred in the second half of the 19th century, the magasins became obsolete. Both history and geography impact the formation of institutions. This study describes one such case of institutional development and attempts to explain why the outcome deviated from the original intention.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1215686274509804,448878736,1,,fra-1050572

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the biggest electric power station of its kind in Ukraine, stopped functioning following Russia's missile strike on Friday.

Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise that manages many major hydroelectric power plants along the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, told local broadcasters that the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station has been severely damaged.

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, also known as the Dnipro Dam, is located in the city of Zaporizhzhia and is made up of two units, but none of them are working, Syrota said.

The power cut from the damaged Dnieper Hydroelectric Station may cause an energy shortage in many Ukrainian regions.

Earlier in the day, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said Russia had launched its largest attack on the country's energy system since the beginning of the year.

The minister said in a statement that power generation facilities, as well as electricity, lines, and energy distribution systems, were hit in several of Ukraine's regions.

Glushchenko noted that one of the power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was de-energized during the shelling.

The management of the plant confirmed the shutdown of one of the two operating high-voltage lines, noting that there was no threat to the safety of the nuclear facility.

The Ukrainian authorities reported a series of explosions across Ukraine earlier Friday morning, and the air raid alert sounded in all regions.

According to the ministry, the goal of the strike was to disable enterprises, producing and repairing military equipment and ammunition, as well as to destroy stocks of weapons delivered from NATO countries.

""From March 16 to 22, the armed forces of the Russian Federation, in response to the shelling of Russian territory, carried out a total of 49 retaliatory strikes with missiles, including Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missiles, and drones. Their targets included decision-making centers, airfields, production facilities, and warehouses,"" it said.

Stability AI, which has been backed by investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue Management, doesn't have an immediate permanent replacement for the CEO role but has appointed its COO Shan Shan Wong and CTO Christian Laforte as interim co-CEOs, it said in a blog post.

Stability AI, which has lost more than half a dozen key talent in recent quarters, said Mostaque is stepping down to pursue decentralized AI. In a series of posts on X, Mostaque opined that one can't beat ""centralized AI"" with more ""centralized AI,"" referring to the ownership structure of top AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

He additionally asserted that it was his decision to step down from the top role as he held the most number of controlling shares. ""We should have more transparent & distributed governance in AI as it becomes more and more important. Its [sic] a hard problem, but I think we can fix it..,"" he added. ""The concentration of power in AI is bad for us all. I decided to step down to fix this at Stability & elsewhere.""

Mostaque's departure from Stability AI, a startup known for its popular image generation tool Stable Diffusion, comes amid an ongoing struggle at the startup that was spending a reported estimate of $8 million a month as of October 2023, according to Bloomberg, which also noted that the startup had unsuccessfully attempted to raise new funding at a $4 billion valuation.

Mostaque, it appears, wasn't prioritizing revenue growth about a year ago. In a post on X last year, he expressed his amusement at the generative AI companies' ""strange focus on revenue"" even as ""the technology is useful but far from vaguely mature as new breakthroughs happen almost daily."" He cited several examples, including MagicLeap, which spent billions before generating revenue.

""The payoffs on proper generative AI R&D are clearer and faster to market than just about anything we've seen. It's going to create way more economic value than self driving cars for example, the total investment in that has been $100b with no revenue pay off,"" he wrote.

His comments on Reddit last month offered insights into a shift in focus. ""We are doing fine and ahead of forecasts this year already. Our aim is to be cash flow positive this year, think we could get there sooner rather than later,"" he wrote.

""The market is huge and open models will be needed for edge and all regulated industries. This is why we are one of the only companies to open data, code, training run details and more. Custom models, consulting and more are huge markets and very reasonable business models around this as we enter enterprise adoption over the next year or so, last year was just testing.""

Land ownership in Scotland has become even more concentrated despite two decades of land reform legislation, with green capital investors becoming increasingly dominant, a study has found.

Andy Wightman, the land reform campaigner who published a groundbreaking look at Scottish land distribution in 2012, has calculated that half of all privately owned rural land in Scotland, or 3.2m hectares (7.9m acres), is held by just 433 people and companies, with only 2.76% of rural Scotland held by community groups.

His analysis shows that hereditary peers own less land than previously, while the number of private investors who specialise in financially lucrative ""green capital"" schemes to create forestry and peat restoration projects has surged.

Scotland's third largest landowner is Gresham House, an investment firm taken over recently by the US private equity firm Searchlight Capital; Wightman's detailed analysis of Land Registry records has established it owns 53,775 hectares across 161 separate holdings.

The Duke of Buccleuch, who was Scotland's largest private landowner when Wightman did his last survey in 2012, has been voluntarily selling land to local residents, yet is still second, holding 66,345 hectares, 32% less than in 2012.

Buccleuch Estates has been supplanted as Scotland's largest landowner by Anders Povlsen, the Danish Asos mail order billionaire, who owns 88,296 hectares spread across 12 estates; his Highland empire has grown by 37% since 2012.

Povlsen is one of a number of extremely wealthy Scandinavians buying up Highland estates, including Strathconon Estates Ltd (previously known as Kirkbi Estates Ltd), an arm of the philanthropic investment firm owned by the family of the Lego heir Kirk Kristiansen.

Wightman calculates that the estate at Strathconon near Inverness has grown to 36,933 hectares, making Kirkbi Scotland's ninth largest private land owner. Kirkbi believes its holdings to be slightly smaller, at approximately 34,500 hectares.

Wightman's data has come from records held by Registers of Scotland, the official land register, and more accurate land mass data from Ordnance Survey. That has allowed him to recalculate the figures he originally published in 2012 in his book The Poor Had No Lawyers. Modern records show that 440 owners owned half of Scotland's private land in 2012, not the 432 he originally reported.

Wightman and other land campaigners argue the latest data is evidence that the Scottish parliament's attempts to empower community buyouts to diversify rural landownership has failed, despite enacting several laws to strengthen right to buy laws and asset transfers.

Despite several significant buyouts, including the sale of 4,000 hectares on Langholm Moor to local residents by Buccleuch Estates and the purchase of the island of Ulva off Mull, part-funded with £4.4m from the government-backed Scottish Land Fund, sales of that scale are very rare.

Scottish government figures show the amount of community-owned land has grown by just 40,048 hectares in the last decade, from 172,294 hectares in 2012 to 212,342 hectares. By comparison, Scotland's state-owned forestry agency owns 656,000 hectares.

In 2013, Alex Salmond, the then first minister, set a target of 1m hectares in community ownership by 2020, yet under Holyrood's right to buy laws only 0.24% of rural Scotland had come into community ownership over the Past 20 years, Wightman said.

""Scotland has the most concentrated pattern of land ownership in Europe,"" he said. ""There's nothing in the current reforms which will make any substantial change to that. If we're serious about changing that, we need to embrace reforms which will absolutely deliver.""

Pressed to do more to diversify ownership by the Scottish Land Commission, a quango set up in 2017, the Scottish government is proposing new powers to allow ministers to break up large estates of more than 1,000 hectares that go on sale into smaller parcels, a process known as lotting.

Ministers argue that lotting will allow more communities, farmers, woodland-creators and businesses to own land, at more affordable prices. The dramatic surge in land acquisitions by natural capital investors such as Gresham House has pushed land prices to record levels and substantially increased competition.

Community Land Scotland, which represents community owners and is campaigning for a new target to reach 10% of rural land to be community-owned by 2030, argues lotting will have little impact since only a tiny fraction of rural land is sold each year.

Wightman and CLS argue that more radical action is needed, such as including inherited land and company share transfers in land reform measures, and properly taxing land, alongside much greater financial support and shared ownership options for community buyers.

Wightman has found investment firms such as Gresham House build up significant overall holdings by buying smaller forests, estates or farms that escape the new 1,000-hectare threshold for lotting. He has encountered another investment firm trying to buy 14 properties covering nearly 6,000 hectares, none of which would meet the lotting threshold.

Gresham House, which markets its forestry projects as tax-efficient investments, insists they are ultimately owned by its clients. ""Forests managed by Gresham House make a major contribution to Scotland's rural economy and support hundreds of jobs,"" it said.

Mairi Gougeon, the Scottish government's land reform secretary, said the ""targeted and proportionate"" powers set out in the land reform bill would apply to more than 50% of Scotland.

""I would like to see us own more of our own land and waters and for that public ownership to be clearly undertaken in the interests of everyone who lives in Scotland.

Community Land Scotland, which represents community owners and is campaigning for a new target to reach 10% of rural land to be community-owned by 2030, argues lotting will have little impact since only a tiny fraction of rural land is sold each year.

Wightman and CLS argue that more radical action is needed, such as including inherited land and company share transfers in land reform measures, and properly taxing land, alongside much greater financial support and shared ownership options for community buyers.

Wightman has found investment firms such as Gresham House build up significant overall holdings by buying smaller forests, estates or farms that escape the new 1,000-hectare threshold for lotting. He has encountered another investment firm trying to buy 14 properties covering nearly 6,000 hectares, none of which would meet the lotting threshold.

Gresham House, which markets its forestry projects as tax-efficient investments, insists they are ultimately owned by its clients. ""Forests managed by Gresham House make a major contribution to Scotland's rural economy and support hundreds of jobs,"" it said.

Mairi Gougeon, the Scottish government's land reform secretary, said the ""targeted and proportionate"" powers set out in the land reform bill would apply to more than 50% of Scotland.

""I would like to see us own more of our own land and waters and for that public ownership to be clearly undertaken in the interests of everyone who lives in Scotland. But without the full powers, resources and levers of independence, our ability to do so is limited,"" she said.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.05882352941176472,448873588,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/bef11baad807c5eca97a73bbafe66f8a,

What do people think? Personally we are probably 95% of the way there (lacking household battery and having a PHEV rather than full EV), so little benefit for us. For those who are full on gas (heating, hot water and cooking) plus petrol car, do the number seem to add up?

New Zealand is one of the first countries to reach what's called the 'electrification tipping point', where households can save money and also significantly reduce their emissions by electrifying their appliances and vehicles. On average, homes currently using gas appliances and petrol vehicles could save around $1,500 per year at current interest rates and around $4,500 per year with a low-interest loan if they bought electric equivalents and got their electricity from a combination of rooftop solar, home battery and New Zealand's already highly renewable grid.

The units will work completely off-grid. However, owners will have to buy the solar panels and batteries themselves.

Defy said that the product was developed in response to the elevated levels of load shedding in South Africa and provides an option for households looking to protect their perishables without paying for a full solar installation.

The fridge will retail for R9 999, while the freezer unit will sell for R8 999.

The company recommended that three 550W panels be installed in inland areas and coastal regions install three 700W panels. It also recommends a 200a.h 12V lithium-ion battery.

A battery with those specs is available for R7 690 and a 550W panel is currently available for R2 150, using prices from the Solar Warehouse website. If these prices are used, a total off-grid fridge installation would cost in the order of R20 000.

Defy estimated that the installation is roughly a fifth of the price of a full home solar installation and that the annual electricity savings from the solution will be in the order of R600.

The products will be powered directly by the solar panels and will draw power from the battery at night or in case of poor generation conditions such as cloud cover. It is also possible to connect the products to an electricity supply to convert it to a hybrid solution.

In a statement, Trade, Industry, and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel welcomed the product launch, which was co-developed by South African and Turkish experts.

""Climate change necessitates a comprehensive transformation of the technologies utilised both at home and within the industry,"" he said.

""South Africa is actively ensuring the production of future technologies and meeting the demand for lower-emission consumer products. This opens a platform for green industrialisation by South Africa,"" Patel said.

The products will be available in South African stores later in March.",news24.com,news,news24,,0.1764705882352942,448871544,1,https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/11459/9707b71395df4425bdedb2ae3822c999.jpg,

Derek Vivian, his son Mark, and Mark's son Maxim visited the generating hall to see Turbine 7 before it is decommissioned, after providing electricity to Islanders for almost half a century.

Derek helped to install Turbine 7 in the 1970s and retired 16 years ago after 40 years' service with Jersey Electricity. His son Mark is JE's assets manager, while grandson Maxim is now a JE engineer.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}

So, it came as a bit of a surprise to me that the Peugeot 5008, in ""crossover SUV"" guise has been around since 2017. That's three Tory prime ministers ago and, if you dare to remember when Theresa May was grappling with a chaotic party and the dreadful aftermath of Brexit. Not like now, eh?

Anyway, they gave the old thing a fairly extensive facelift (the car, not May, who is just fine), a couple of years back and made it look quite contemporary. Only the bland boxy rear end makes it look slightly dated. On the whole, with its subtle curve to its haunches, it's quite a good-looking, classy sort of runner, and, by the current increasingly obese standard of SUVs and crossovers, it feels almost compact.

It may well be replaced before too long, but they've not given up on it, and the latest variant of this established player is the hybrid version. Or rather the ""mild hybrid"" version.

Unlike, say, a Toyota Prius or its crossover sibling the RAV4, which are full hybrids with quite a lot of onboard generation of battery power and all-electric silent running, like all mild Hybrids the 5008 is still basically a petrol model, with a small electric generator, battery and 48 volt system added to re-use energy ""wasted"" in braking and to take the strain of running electrical components off the engine.

The result is a 15 per cent of so saving in fuel, and a little more power, in return for a premium over the nearest petrol-only powered equivalent of around £1,400. So it would suit a higher mileage user best. (Interestingly the 5008 is also sold as a diesel, but we don't like to talk about that of thing, do we?).

Just as they did at launch, Peugeot continue to try to make this model in particular have a solid, quality sort of feel so that it can compete with the premium badged competition that have invaded this space in recent times. Peugeot was fairly late to the SUV party, which gave it the chance to see what it was going to be up against and raise its game accordingly. A sort of big frangible 206 on stilts wasn't going to cut it in the 2020s.

They've succeeded, and even the more obviously cheaper materials in the cabin have a flocked finish which is nice and soft to the touch. The faux leather and Alcantara (faux suede) fabrics are equally cosseting, and the touchscreens work reasonably well, with some ""piano key"" switches along the bottom for the stuff you need in a hurry, such as the demister, satnav and radio controls.

Things are not quite ideal, though, because the cruise control is operated by a funny little pod behind the steering wheel which you have to use by touch. You get used to it, of course, but it would be far better if you could set your speed and distance from the vehicle in front with your thumbs directly as you hold the steering wheel. But Peugeot have fitted the 5008 with an extra small steering wheel, of the kind boy racers used to put on Minis and Escorts, so there's no room.

On the other hand, the sporty little wheel feels surprisingly natural, and it's needed for Peugeot's hallmark ""i-Cockpit"", with the dials mounted high above the wheel and near the windscreen. It's an alternative to a proper ""heads up"" display, projected as it were onto the road ahead, and it works very well, making a long drive less wearisome and thus safer. Peugeot isn't afraid of doing things its own way.

The basic equipment levels on all 5008s are good, but for the full premium treatment you should make sure to get the massaging seats and the excellent Focal 10-speaker sound system. They both help while away the miles. It's got plenty of space, with five- or seven-seat options, and nice touches like picnic tables around the cabin.

The one thing it lacks is a four-wheel drive option, but that shouldn't worry anyone really. Performance from the 1.2 litre three-cylinder engine is let's say adequate rather than scorching - but think of the petrol you'll save.

The 5008 competes in an incredibly crowded segment of the market, and (awks) there's no proper all-electric battery powered option, or even a plug-in hybrid. But it holds its own against the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq and Honda CR-V, and it doesn't give much away to the alternatives from Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

It's still a mainstream quality product, but an all-new Peugeot e-5008 is launched in the autumn and will probably be with us around the middle of next year, including the full-electric job. It looks even better than the current one. A Peugeot revival may be underway.

Stability AI, which has been backed by investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue Management, doesn't have an immediate permanent replacement for the CEO role but has appointed its COO Shan Shan Wong and CTO Christian Laforte as interim co-CEOs, it said in a blog post.

Stability AI said Mostaque is stepping down to pursue decentralized AI. In a series of posts on X, Mostaque opined that one can't beat ""centralized AI"" with more ""centralized AI,"" referring to the ownership structure of top AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

He additionally asserted that it was his decision to step down from the top role as he held the most number of controlling shares. ""We should have more transparent & distributed governance in AI as it becomes more and more important. Its [sic] a hard problem, but I think we can fix it..,"" he added. ""The concentration of power in AI is bad for us all. I decided to step down to fix this at Stability & elsewhere.""

Mostaque's departure from Stability AI, a startup known for its popular image generation tool Stable Diffusion, comes amid an ongoing struggle at the startup that was spending a reported estimate of $8 million a month as of October 2023, according to Bloomberg, which also noted that the startup had unsuccessfully attempted to raise new funding at a $4 billion valuation.

Mostaque, it appears, wasn't prioritizing revenue growth about a year ago. In a post on X last year, he expressed his amusement at the generative AI companies' ""strange focus on revenue"" even as ""the technology is useful but far from vaguely mature as new breakthroughs happen almost daily."" He cited several examples, including MagicLeap, which spent billions before generating revenue.

""The payoffs on proper generative AI R&D are clearer and faster to market than just about anything we've seen. It's going to create way more economic value than self driving cars for example, the total investment in that has been $100b with no revenue pay off,"" he wrote.

His comments on Reddit last month offered insights into a shift in focus. ""We are doing fine and ahead of forecasts this year already. Our aim is to be cash flow positive this year, think we could get there sooner rather than later,"" he wrote.

""The market is huge and open models will be needed for edge and all regulated industries. This is why we are one of the only companies to open data, code, training run details and more. Custom models, consulting and more are huge markets and very reasonable business models around this as we enter enterprise adoption over the next year or so, last year was just testing.""

(KFSN) -- A recent upgrade to the Fresno Fire Department is helping protect crews.

On Wednesday night, firefighters knocked a fire at a home near Locus and Erie Avenue in Northwest Fresno.

The fire melted the blinds at the front of the house. When neighbors alerted firefighters that there might be people trapped, they rushed inside.

Thanks to a new thermal imaging camera, firefighters were able to find them.

""One of our firefighters was able to utilize this technology,"" said Captain Shane Brown.

""He was quick-thinking. He was able to scan the room in a harsh environment full of smoke and locate a victim who was down.""

The thermal imaging camera is not only saving lives, but it also keeps firefighters safe.

The camera is attached to this new apparatus and comes with many different features.

Captain Brown showed Action News how some of it works.

""If I have my face piece and I clicked in, I would actually be able to see how many minutes left I have on the cylinder full of air,"" said Captain Brown.

""The computer is constantly calculating the air I'm breathing and it's calculating the rate, telling me how much longer I have. To utilize the thermal imaging camera it's a very simple press of a button and it should go to the thermal imaging camera.""

The old thermal imaging cameras were bigger, bulkier, and heavier.

Firefighters had to clip them onto themselves, and they could only be used by one firefighter at a time.

""Historically the thermal imaging cameras that we have is just another tool or device that you have to hold,"" said Chief Billy Alcorn.

""As they're going inside of a residence, they're carrying their tools. They're pulling hose, they're putting on their mask, and they're doing all those things. Now they're hands free.""

The cost of the new gear is around $4 million.

Fresno City leaders and the fire department worked closely to ensure that the firefighters received the upgraded gear.

Councilmember Mike Karbassi said the investment is worth it.

""It is absolutely important to make sure our firefighters are equipped because they go from zero to 60 in just a moment,"" said Councilmember Karbassi.

Just like how crews on Wednesday night saved those two people.

Captain Brown said most of the department's engines are staffed with four firefighters, which is the national standard.

Brown added having that fourth firefighter helps with rescue and fire attack efforts, just like the one Wednesday night.",abc30.com,news,ABC30 News,,-0.04313725490196074,448868918,1,https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14560798_thermal-camera-img.png?w=1600,

Army Gen. Randy George talked about some of the progress this morning in a conversation with the Defense One digital media platform in Washington.

""We have all seen how the battlefield is changing. [and] I know that such a big C2 is impossible. [command and control] ""We know that machines can do many things more efficiently and much more cheaply. We will need to incorporate them into our formation,"" George said. Told.

George spoke to Defense One after just returning from observing Project Convergence Capstone 4, an experiment involving the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Space Force. The experiment, called PC-C4, was a two-phase joint and multinational experiment conducted from February 23 to March 20 at the Army National Training Center at Camp Pendleton, California, and Fort Irwin, California. Ta.

Led by Army Futures Command, Project Convergence is a series of experiments that gives warfighters the opportunity to experiment with technology at the operational level and further refine how they synchronize as a joint force.

""Technology is advancing really quickly,"" George said. [PC-C4] It gave us an opportunity to think about how we could do that. ""

As an example of how advanced technology can be integrated into Army formations, George observed a light infantry company operating in a simulated urban environment while incorporating robotic dogs and unmanned aerial systems to sense the environment. He explained that it was possible.

""It was all tied together by a very simple command and control network that was easy to use and intuitive,"" George says. ""It was amazing.""

George said a hands-on approach to innovation during experimentation like PC-C4 can be very advantageous when compared to traditional top-down innovation.

""I don't think there's any substitute for testing...in an environment where you know you need to operate. This is not testing something in a showroom,"" the general said. ""This is actually starting to be used. [the technology] Where they use it...and I think that's where we do the best learning. ""

As for the timeline for integrating modernization capabilities, George said it depends on future budgets and there is no specific date or schedule for all modernizations, but the Army is focused on ""incremental improvements."" .

""We have a sense of crisis,"" he said. ""I think everyone wants change.""

The conference, held at the Delta Hotel in Toronto, was hosted by the Hub for Sustainability Integration -- a partnership between the School of Accounting and Finance and the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo.

Panel discussions explored current trends in climate, energy, and nature; navigating a disrupted economy; and how to integrate sustainability into organizations as well as the various opportunities and pitfalls that come with it.

""I am encouraged to see the cross-section of professionals, industry leaders, researchers, faculty and students represented here today,"" said Vivek Goel, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waterloo, during remarks made to conference attendees.

""In today's rapidly changing world, it will take a collaborative effort to shape a financially sound and environmentally responsible future. The ultimate goal of our HUB for Sustainability Integration is to ensure sustainability is a consideration in all business decisions.""

Catherine McKenna, former Environment Minister, was the conference's keynote speaker and highlighted why carbon pricing is a smart economic decision policymakers and businesses need to adopt.

""I am a Canadian who cares about doing right by the environment, doing right by the economy, and doing right by people including affordability,"" McKenna said during her keynote address. ""We're actually doing things that are the most affordable way to do things to create incentives for people to reduce emissions, and where they have more money in their pockets.""

McKenna also discussed the efforts being made around the world to step up efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels as part of a global plan adopted by the Paris Agreement to lower emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. However, there remains a lack of adequate investment in clean energy despite demanding subsidies and charging higher prices for fossil fuels.

""We're all in a coalition of states, cities, regions, financial institutions and corporates. So, the world is moving on and national governments are playing a significant role, especially in fossil fuels. We are making very good progress and no one can stop progress because the economic case is clear and the environmental case is clear,"" McKenna said.

Barbara Zvan, president of the University Pension Plan, spoke during a morning keynote session and highlighted the need to integrate sustainability into business strategy and operations amid record-breaking heat waves and severe weather events in Canada. She also noted that none of the Canadian companies on the pension fund's watchlist disclosed their plans to align their capital deployment to help reduce global greenhouse emissions to keep global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

""Our overarching goal is to leverage the power of the collective voice to promote the just transition to net zero economy, meaning a transition that does not leave workers, communities and equity deserving groups like Indigenous people behind,"" Zvan said.

Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, also spoke during the conference, noting that financial costs associated with climate change show that insurable claims due to catastrophic loss have exceeded $1 billion annually for 14 out of the last 15 years, the majority of which is from residential basement flooding. That's impacted the housing market in areas like Quebec and Atlantic Canada as some insurers won't offer mortgages to areas that they deem the flood risk too high, he said.

""We've been asleep at the switch to some degree because we haven't been preparing for these floods that are getting more challenging over time,"" Feltmate said.",indiaeducationdiary.in,news,"India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary",,0.3411764705882352,448860179,1,https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dsf3922_0.webp?w=640,

This ""togetherness"" fosters a national bond, social cohesion, and unity within diverse segments of society. It promotes political and economic integration, striving for parity despite social disparities.

While the presence of diverse groups can create complexities, national integration doesn't necessitate uniformity in thought. Instead, it celebrates differences while fostering a sense of shared identity. This unity strengthens the nation during challenging times, both domestically and internationally. National integration paves the way for economic growth and development by reducing religious, ethnic, and cultural disparities. It allows a country to pursue its ideals in harmony, embracing its diverse tapestry.

Economic integration is a multifaceted concept. While it fosters interdependence between countries, it also interacts with national identity and economic interests. The distribution of economic activity within the integrated region can significantly impact development and inequality among member states.

Scholars like Robert O Keohane and Joseph S Nye highlight the importance of interdependence as a driver of integration. However, the interaction of political and economic actors shapes policies that influence the outcomes of interdependence at both domestic and international levels.

National interests can sometimes clash with the benefits of integration. Countries may adopt protectionist policies to reduce external dependence. Yet, strong institutions of global governance remain essential for shaping effective economic policies.

Addressing disparities and ensuring equal access to resources are imperative for fostering national integration, as they impact the size of the market for different classes to benefit from economic dividends.

Rule-based institutions play a vital role in national integration, ensuring equitable treatment before the law and preventing elite capture of resources.

To achieve economic integration and cohesion, a well-functioning single market is essential. This market should be competitive and ensure fair resource allocation.

A shared vision of a ""common future"" could bridge this gap. By fostering a sense of collective well-being and ensuring just and equitable resource distribution among its 230 million citizens, Pakistan can unlock the potential for economic integration and national development.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has the potential to contribute to national cohesion and just resource distribution, but its success hinges on effective implementation and management.

CPEC's infrastructure development projects (roads, railways, ports, and energy facilities) could foster economic integration by distributing benefits to a wider range of economic groups across Pakistan and enhancing connectivity between different regions.

Equitable regional development is crucial. By prioritising infrastructure investment in less-developed areas like Balochistan and KP, CPEC can help reduce regional disparities and achieve more balanced growth.

Investing in human capital through CPEC and other projects can create jobs. This should involve an inclusive approach, focusing on both skilled and unskilled labour, while also ensuring gender parity by promoting women's participation in these projects.

Industrialisation, particularly in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), has the potential to stimulate economic growth nationwide. By attracting industries to set up operations in these zones, job creation can be fostered across various regions of Pakistan.

Energy security is another crucial factor for national cohesion. CPEC's energy projects aim to address Pakistan's energy shortages, which can help reduce disparities in access to reliable and affordable energy. This, in turn, can support industrial growth and economic development throughout the country.

However, achieving development goals must be balanced with environmental considerations. Climate change and environmental degradation pose major challenges to social cohesion. Large-scale projects, like dams or highways, can lead to community displacement if not managed properly.

Investing in human capital is critical for national integration. By improving access to quality education and healthcare across the country, disparities can be reduced and social cohesion fostered. This includes investing in vocational education to equip the workforce with the skills needed for a competitive economy.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can play a vital role in spreading economic benefits more evenly. Supporting SMEs requires providing them with access to finance and markets, allowing them to flourish and contribute to national growth.

Creating a level playing field for economic activity is essential. Streamlining regulations and reducing bureaucratic hurdles can significantly improve the business environment. Pakistan's initiatives like the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are positive steps towards attracting foreign investment and stimulating economic growth.

Simplifying business registration processes, improving contract enforcement mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in regulations are crucial steps. These reforms will not only enhance Pakistan's reputation among investors but also foster inclusive growth, ultimately contributing to national integration. Additionally, effective enforcement of competition laws can prevent monopolies and unfair practices, ensuring a level playing field for businesses across the country. This allows all regions to participate in economic integration and benefit from its advantages.

Financial inclusion is another key element. Providing access to finance in less developed areas is essential for empowering SMEs and startups. The government can achieve this through initiatives such as:

Reducing income inequality is crucial for national integration. This can be achieved through equipping the workforce with relevant skills to enhance their employability and earning potential.

A tax system that distributes the burden more equitably can reduce the strain on low- and middle-income earners. Broadening the tax base can also generate additional revenue for development initiatives. Implementing these reforms will foster a sense of fair treatment among citizens, potentially leading to increased tax compliance and contribution.

Respecting provincial autonomy and constitutional rights creates a stable foundation for economic activity. By working together within a framework of mutual respect, federal and provincial governments can promote a sense of shared prosperity and national unity.

The ultimate goal of policymakers should be to create an environment that maximises social well-being for all citizens. This requires a strong sense of national integration, where diverse populations feel united by a common purpose. Throughout history, nations that have lost sight of this unity have faced internal and external threats.

National integration is fostered by institutions that promote fairness, equity, and opportunity. The measures discussed above, such as investment in human capital, development of a level playing field for businesses, and ensuring secure property rights, all contribute to this goal. By building a more integrated and inclusive economy, Pakistan can lay the foundation for sustainable development and national cohesion.",thenews.com.pk,news,The News International,,0.3098039215686275,448857250,1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-03-23/l_1171353_065650_updates.jpg,

(AP) -- At least IndyCar is trying something new, which is the key takeaway from this weekend's $1 million exhibition at the private Thermal Club in the California desert.

The made-for-TV event is an all-star race of sorts, with a unique format that includes heat races and a main event for the fastest 12 in the 27-car field.

The Sunday race itself -- call it the ""A Main"" if you'd like -- is 20 laps split into two 10-lap segments. It will be run in front of limited spectators as the Thermal Club is a private course with only 180 members.

It was supposed to pay out $1 million to be split with the race winner and a Thermal Club member, but the payout structure fell apart and the winner will now only receive $500,000.

That's still quite a bit of money for a race worth nothing in the championship picture and, most important, its an opportunity for IndyCar to fill a hole in its early-season schedule with something entirely different.

""We'll put on a show, that's what it's about,"" Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin said. ""It's funny when you dangle a carrot in front of a bunch of race drivers with a bunch of egos -- we want to win regardless of what event we're in, whether it's for a million, $4 million, 50 cents, we'll just race for that win.

""I think it's exciting to do it. IndyCar stepping outside the square, trying something different, hasn't happened much in the past. To be a part of that is exciting.""

The project has been more than a year in the making as IndyCar used Thermal in early 2023 for preseason testing to determine its viability for hosting a race. Safety improvements improved the 17-turn, 3.067-mile track to a Grade 2 FIA approved facility.

Much of the improvements have been the addition of tire barriers, improved runoff areas and, according to Thermal member Don Cusick, who enters two cars in the Indianapolis 500, ""a few changes to some of the apexes in the turns that made it a little more friendly, I think, for the cars to race on. At least that's from the members' feedback so far.""

The track located near Coachella and outside of Palm Springs is typically used for members to tool around with their extensive collection of luxury cars. Membership to Thermal requires the purchase of property inside the club, and a standard membership starts at $85,000.

The initial plan had been to pair a member with an IndyCar driver and the members would hold their own amateur race. The combined result would determine the overall $1 million winner.

But not enough Thermal Club members were willing to buy into the program so the purse is at only $500,000. The club held a Thursday night welcome party in which members were blindly drawn and matched with an IndyCar driver, which has now turned into an embedded experience with the driver and team.

""I think ultimately it just came down to we've got a lot of amateur racers out here, not a lot of professional racers. I think people just weren't quite certain that they were at the level required to compete as would be expected for that kind of prize money,"" Cusick said. ""We're kind of talking through that as members and as a club. We'll see where that leads.

""But I think for this year it might just have been a little bit overwhelming and they didn't quite know what to expect, and that's a part of it.""

The Sunday morning event also will have very limited spectators as teams and members were allowed only a handful of guests to enter the Thermal Club, which has guards at every gate opening and requires a QR code authorization for entrance.

""We never thought of it as let's see how many people we can sell tickets to to be there for this,"" said Mark Miles, CEO of Penske Entertainment. ""It's normally a private facility. It was meant to be a kind of high-end hospitality offering. So it's a little pricey. Pricing changed, but it's still kind of pricey.

""But we think that this is the right way to put it forward to get a good number, but a manageable number of fans to the track.""",kion546.com,news,KION546,Associated Press,0.2862745098039217,448854663,1,https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,

The driver that topped the charts was once again Alex Palou, with the reigning champion backing up his performance from the previous session.

Palou lapped the winding course in 1 minute 39.3373 seconds, just a hair faster than his best time a couple hours before but nearly half a second ahead of everyone else in this session.

Felix Rosenqvist set the second fastest time, continuing his good relationship with his new Meyer Shank Racing team. Romain Grosjean was third fastest, also forging a strong relationship with his new team.

Rinus VeeKay and Christian Lundgaard were fourth and fifth, giving each a solid data point to work from for the rest of the weekend.

There was only one stoppage during the second test run, Christian Rasmussen being the cause. The rookie pulled his Ed Carpenter Racing Chevy to the side of the road and was towed back to the pits, but was able to return and run more laps later.

All 27 drivers struggled with grip throughout the afternoon, with cars sliding all around the course that was designed for private use by its wealthy club members.

A dark groove started to build up as Firestone rubber was worked into the tarmac, but the California sun heated the track beyond optimal temperatures.

Seemingly every couple minutes a driver was seen overshooting a braking zone or having to counter steer in order to catch a sliding rear end.

Very few actually spun, however, and a couple trips through the gravel were the biggest consequences felt in the afternoon session.

The slippery track was a factor in the high tire wear everyone experienced, and most drivers reported that times started to fall off significantly after just two or three laps.

Sunday's feature event is 20 laps in length and tire changes will not be allowed, meaning whoever can conserve their grip levels the best could well leave with a hefty sum in their pockets.

Each member of the top six held the top spot at one point during the afternoon, with most of the change coming in the final hour.

While track temperatures jumped from 80F to 100F during the opening test session, it jumped to as high as 122F in the afternoon session before falling down to 110F in the final hour.

After logging the most laps in the first session, Chip Ganassi Racing rookie Kyffin Simpson continued the theme by pounding 38 laps in the afternoon. He ended up 18 when the checkered flag fell on the day, 1.7376s behind.

Other than a few drivers going off-track briefly, there was only one incident that brought out a red flag nearly 45 minutes into the three hours of running after Christian Rasmussen (Ed Carpenter Racing) was stopped in Turn 6.

(AP) -- At least IndyCar is trying something new, which is the key takeaway from this weekend's $1 million exhibition at the private Thermal Club in the California desert.

The made-for-TV event is an all-star race of sorts, with a unique format that includes heat races and a main event for the fastest 12 in the 27-car field.

The Sunday race itself -- call it the ""A Main"" if you'd like -- is 20 laps split into two 10-lap segments. It will be run in front of limited spectators as the Thermal Club is a private course with only 180 members.

It was supposed to pay out $1 million to be split with the race winner and a Thermal Club member, but the payout structure fell apart and the winner will now only receive $500,000.

That's still quite a bit of money for a race worth nothing in the championship picture and, most important, its an opportunity for IndyCar to fill a hole in its early-season schedule with something entirely different.

""We'll put on a show, that's what it's about,"" Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin said. ""It's funny when you dangle a carrot in front of a bunch of race drivers with a bunch of egos -- we want to win regardless of what event we're in, whether it's for a million, $4 million, 50 cents, we'll just race for that win.

""I think it's exciting to do it. IndyCar stepping outside the square, trying something different, hasn't happened much in the past. To be a part of that is exciting.""

The project has been more than a year in the making as IndyCar used Thermal in early 2023 for preseason testing to determine its viability for hosting a race. Safety improvements improved the 17-turn, 3.067-mile track to a Grade 2 FIA approved facility.

Much of the improvements have been the addition of tire barriers, improved runoff areas and, according to Thermal member Don Cusick, who enters two cars in the Indianapolis 500, ""a few changes to some of the apexes in the turns that made it a little more friendly, I think, for the cars to race on. At least that's from the members' feedback so far.""

The track located near Coachella and outside of Palm Springs is typically used for members to tool around with their extensive collection of luxury cars. Membership to Thermal requires the purchase of property inside the club, and a standard membership starts at $85,000.

The initial plan had been to pair a member with an IndyCar driver and the members would hold their own amateur race. The combined result would determine the overall $1 million winner.

But not enough Thermal Club members were willing to buy into the program so the purse is at only $500,000. The club held a Thursday night welcome party in which members were blindly drawn and matched with an IndyCar driver, which has now turned into an embedded experience with the driver and team.

""I think ultimately it just came down to we've got a lot of amateur racers out here, not a lot of professional racers. I think people just weren't quite certain that they were at the level required to compete as would be expected for that kind of prize money,"" Cusick said. ""We're kind of talking through that as members and as a club. We'll see where that leads.

""But I think for this year it might just have been a little bit overwhelming and they didn't quite know what to expect, and that's a part of it.""

The Sunday morning event also will have very limited spectators as teams and members were allowed only a handful of guests to enter the Thermal Club, which has guards at every gate opening and requires a QR code authorization for entrance.

""We never thought of it as let's see how many people we can sell tickets to to be there for this,"" said Mark Miles, CEO of Penske Entertainment. ""It's normally a private facility. It was meant to be a kind of high-end hospitality offering. So it's a little pricey. Pricing changed, but it's still kind of pricey.

The track located near Coachella and outside of Palm Springs is typically used for members to tool around with their extensive collection of luxury cars. Membership to Thermal requires the purchase of property inside the club, and a standard membership starts at $85,000.

The initial plan had been to pair a member with an IndyCar driver and the members would hold their own amateur race. The combined result would determine the overall $1 million winner.

But not enough Thermal Club members were willing to buy into the program so the purse is at only $500,000. The club held a Thursday night welcome party in which members were blindly drawn and matched with an IndyCar driver, which has now turned into an embedded experience with the driver and team.

""I think ultimately it just came down to we've got a lot of amateur racers out here, not a lot of professional racers. I think people just weren't quite certain that they were at the level required to compete as would be expected for that kind of prize money,"" Cusick said. ""We're kind of talking through that as members and as a club. We'll see where that leads.

""But I think for this year it might just have been a little bit overwhelming and they didn't quite know what to expect, and that's a part of it.""

The Sunday morning event also will have very limited spectators as teams and members were allowed only a handful of guests to enter the Thermal Club, which has guards at every gate opening and requires a QR code authorization for entrance.

""We never thought of it as let's see how many people we can sell tickets to to be there for this,"" said Mark Miles, CEO of Penske Entertainment. ""It's normally a private facility. It was meant to be a kind of high-end hospitality offering. So it's a little pricey. Pricing changed, but it's still kind of pricey.

""But we think that this is the right way to put it forward to get a good number, but a manageable number of fans to the track.""

(AP) -- At least IndyCar is trying something new, which is the key takeaway from this weekend's $1 million exhibition at the private Thermal Club in the California desert.

The made-for-TV event is an all-star race of sorts, with a unique format that includes heat races and a main event for the fastest 12 in the 27-car field.

The Sunday race itself -- call it the ""A Main"" if you'd like -- is 20 laps split into two 10-lap segments. It will be run in front of limited spectators as the Thermal Club is a private course with only 180 members.

It was supposed to pay out $1 million to be split with the race winner and a Thermal Club member, but the payout structure fell apart and the winner will now only receive $500,000.

That's still quite a bit of money for a race worth nothing in the championship picture and, most important, its an opportunity for IndyCar to fill a hole in its early-season schedule with something entirely different.

""We'll put on a show, that's what it's about,"" Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin said. ""It's funny when you dangle a carrot in front of a bunch of race drivers with a bunch of egos -- we want to win regardless of what event we're in, whether it's for a million, $4 million, 50 cents, we'll just race for that win.

""I think it's exciting to do it. IndyCar stepping outside the square, trying something different, hasn't happened much in the past. To be a part of that is exciting.""

The project has been more than a year in the making as IndyCar used Thermal in early 2023 for preseason testing to determine its viability for hosting a race. Safety improvements improved the 17-turn, 3.067-mile track to a Grade 2 FIA approved facility.

The made-for-TV event is an all-star race of sorts, with a unique format that includes heat races and a main event for the fastest 12 in the 27-car field.

The Sunday race itself -- call it the ""A Main"" if you'd like -- is 20 laps split into two 10-lap segments. It will be run in front of limited spectators as the Thermal Club is a private course with only 180 members.

It was supposed to pay out $1 million to be split with the race winner and a Thermal Club member, but the payout structure fell apart and the winner will now only receive $500,000.

That's still quite a bit of money for a race worth nothing in the championship picture and, most important, its an opportunity for IndyCar to fill a hole in its early-season schedule with something entirely different.

""We'll put on a show, that's what it's about,"" Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin said. ""It's funny when you dangle a carrot in front of a bunch of race drivers with a bunch of egos -- we want to win regardless of what event we're in, whether it's for a million, $4 million, 50 cents, we'll just race for that win.

The project has been more than a year in the making as IndyCar used Thermal in early 2023 for preseason testing to determine its viability for hosting a race. Safety improvements improved the 17-turn, 3.067-mile track to a Grade 2 FIA approved facility.

Much of the improvements have been the addition of tire barriers, improved runoff areas and, according to Thermal member Don Cusick, who enters two cars in the Indianapolis 500, ""a few changes to some of the apexes in the turns that made it a little more friendly, I think, for the cars to race on. At least that's from the members' feedback so far.""

The track located near Coachella and outside of Palm Springs is typically used for members to tool around with their extensive collection of luxury cars. Membership to Thermal requires the purchase of property inside the club, and a standard membership starts at $85,000.

The initial plan had been to pair a member with an IndyCar driver and the members would hold their own amateur race. The combined result would determine the overall $1 million winner.

But not enough Thermal Club members were willing to buy into the program so the purse is at only $500,000. The club held a Thursday night welcome party in which members were blindly drawn and matched with an IndyCar driver, which has now turned into an embedded experience with the driver and team.

""I think ultimately it just came down to we've got a lot of amateur racers out here, not a lot of professional racers.

The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office's minimum viable capability for the Pentagon's Combined Joined All-Domain Command and Control initiative is up and running. The office is now getting ready to bring in more companies.

The CDAO will spend the next three to six months developing a set of requirements that will allow more companies to contribute to the expansion of the data integration layer.

""We've been doing this with key industrial partners, mostly Palantir and Anduril. The technology that we've built -- it's there, it's available. That's why we call it a minimum viable capability. We then need to build out a set of requirements that allow other industrial partners to join in,"" CDAO's chief Craig Martell said during the House Armed Services Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee hearing Friday.

CJADC2, more broadly, aims to use data, cloud, artificial intelligence and much more to connect all military assets and enable faster decision-making.

When Martell assumed his role as the CDAO's chief in 2022, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks tasked the office with launching the Global Information Dominance Experiment, also known as GIDE.

Last year, the CDAO office held several GIDE events. The primary goal was to deliver a joint data integration layer allowing INDOPACOM, CENTCOM, NORTHCOM, their components and international partners to access and exchange data. The last iteration of the experiment resulted in the minimum viable capability for CJADC2.

""We've been building out the prototype of what it would mean for the hardware to support the flow of data across combatant commands so combatant commands have a unified picture of what's going on in the world,"" Martell said.

""We do it every 90 days to these guided exercises, as the key learning exercise to understand through Wargaming what combatant commanders would need to see and what all of the components under the combatant commanders would need to see, would need to exchange and how data would need to flow in order for it to go from swivel chair and PowerPoint and email to digital data flows as that information goes across the combatant command and within the combatant commands,"" he added.

The Pentagon has been vague about the applications or the regions the minimum viable capability is currently being used.

During the hearing, Martell was also asked about the possibility of his office having direct authority over the military services and their development of CJADC2 solutions.

""I'm not a fan of that. And I'm not a fan of hard authority there. Let me just say, in general, the center should provide oversight and policy and best practices. The edge knows their problems best. Solving the problems from the center and imposing it upon the edge, I think is dangerous. It's going to create a one-size-fits-all solution,"" said Martell.

He said there has to be authority about the interface, which will allow the right data to flow out of the services. The Army-led Project Convergence and the Navy's Project Overmatch, for example, aim to find solutions for the ways data would flow.

""What we've been doing is putting the tech before the policy. To allow the data to flow is going to force the right questions. Then there's going to be an increased demand for data to flow. And then we can say, 'Well, that now is a policy issue that we can tackle,"" Martell said.

Ford's luxury brand is introducing cutting-edge digital tech -- but without the battery skateboard chassis underneath.

Debuting inside the midsize Nautilus SUV, the Lincoln Digital Experience's 48-inch, pillar-to-pillar screen is the most revolutionary cabin since Tesla -- leaning into the brand's ""quiet luxury"" theme along with its self-driving BlueCruise driver-assistance system, boutique dealership experiences and digitally scented tech. Under the hood are traditional, sippy, turbo-4 gas engines.

""[We're] listening to what customers really need. Navigator customers tend to tow more, so [battery power] doesn't make as much sense,"" Lincoln President Dianne Craig said, referring to the brand's flagship, three-row, twin-turbo V6-powered SUV. ""That's how we think about this transition -- whether it's hybrids, plug-in hybrids, full hybrids, ultimately to EVs down the road -- it's going to be different depending on segmentation. And segmentation is different based on different customers we serve.""

Lincoln has installed a pillar-to-pillar screen like that featured in the Star concept into the production version of the redesigned Nautilus. (Lincoln/TNS)

That's a sharp U-turn from just two years ago. In April 2022, Lincoln was sprinting to an electric future under then-President Joy Falotico with the introduction of the Lincoln Star Concept -- revealing a new, dynamic, grille-less fascia complete with light show like crosstown rival Cadillac and its Lyriq EV.

The Star was the first of three EVs to be delivered by next year -- and a fourth by 2026 -- as the brand predicted half of its global volume would be electric by mid-decade. At the EV's Los Angeles premiere, brand spokesperson and actor Matthew McConaughey gushed that the Star ""has a wonderful identity. It's not a new page; it's a new chapter.""

At the Nautilus media test drive in Palm Springs, there was not an electric vehicle in sight.

""Back in 2021 and 2022, there was overall hope from automakers that was ahead of what was realistic,"" said analyst Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global associate director of auto intelligence. ""You have to sell to pragmatic buyers after the first adopters and that's been hard to do. Electric vehicles are not taking off like the industry expected.""

Actor Matthew McConaughey gushed in April 2022 that the Lincoln Star ""has a wonderful identity. It's not a new page; it's a new chapter."" However, its arrival has been slowed by Lincoln. (Lincoln/TNS)

The Blue Oval's Ford brand took the lead on EVs, unveiling the Mustang Mach-E SUV and Lightning pickup to rave media reviews and a flood of customer pre-orders. Fast forward to January and the Mach-E was the nation's eighth-slowest selling vehicle with 302 days of inventory according to CarEdge. Lightning, meanwhile, reduced production from three shifts to one due to reduced demand.

Still, the niche sales brought Ford needed breathing room from government regulations that threaten other automakers with billions in fines in the decade ahead. Toyota, for example, says it will pay the fines rather than build vehicles customers don't want.

""Ford has changed its plans for electrification and that has impacted Lincoln,"" Brinley said.

Confirmed Craig: ""We're not going to make any grand declarations specific to where the brand is going with electrification until . . . we really understand what our premium customers want. The time will come, for sure, but right now we are focused on the wonderful product lineup we have between the Corsair, Nautilus and new Aviator.""

What that product line shares with the electric Star Concept is the wall-to-wall jumbotron. The Nautilus allows Lincoln to focus on its technology story -- which has been synonymous with EVs -- while maintaining buzz with gas-electric hybrid drivetrains in Nautilus and Corsair.

""Nautilus is important because its is bringing tech into the brand,"" said Brinley.

The panoramic screen complements a digital, push-button console shifter and seven digital scents that customers can release into the cabin. This tech in the Nautilus will migrate to other models.

""It's not just tech for tech's sake, it's very intuitive tech,"" Craig said. ""The screen is stunning when you get into the car. It's first in segment. It needs to be simple; it need to be intuitive because some of these technologies are not.""

The Lincoln Digital Experience was introduced much like a living room suite, with journalists taking system tutorials while in a hotel -- before taking the Nautilus out on the road.

Tesla and Lucid luxury brands introduce customers to their unique, high-tech interiors -- not in dealerships -- but in boutiques inside shopping malls and in city storefronts. Stripped of the intimidation of sales desks and test drives, boutiques allow casual customers to sample features.

Lincoln, too, is moving to this idea as a way to advance its slogan: Power of Sanctuary.

The brand has encouraged closing traditional dealerships and opening what it calls vitrines (inspired by French glass display cases) like the dealer-run Sanderson Lincoln Boutique in Scottsdale, Ariz., or the brand-owned Lincoln Experience Center in Newport Beach, Calif.

Vitrines are comfortable spaces complete with technology demonstrations, a cafe and a few new cars.

""It's about meeting customers where they want us to serve them,"" said Craig. ""We have our vitrines -- almost 60 that are done -- they are beautiful facilities that are all about being warm and personally crafted. We have another 30 in the works.""

""We know our customers want a no-pressure environment,"" she continued. ""If a customer doesn't want to come into a dealership, then we will meet them on their terms, including in their home or place of business.""

That low-pressure environment extends to not forcing EVs, even as automakers like Lincoln see the transition as inevitable.

""There is transition with any technology including electric vehicles. We'll eventually come to that tipping point,"" said the Lincoln president. ""But right now [from] everything we are learning from our customers, now is not the right time for us to be making those declarations about EVs.""",ttnews.com,news,Transport Topics,,0.1137254901960785,448843866,1,https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x314_with_tt_orange_bar_overlay/public/2024-03/Lincoln-1200.jpg,

I started this project because I often travel in convoy with friends to remote areas where sending a simple WhatsApp message is impossible due to non-existent cell phone signal. This makes it difficult to let friends know which turn to take or when we are stopping for a break without them being able to physically see us take a turn or pull over.

Each of these devices, one for each vehicle or group of people, creates a WiFi hotspot that any Android compatible phone can connect to with the accompanying Android app. Groups of people can then communicate, in group chat fashion, with a maximum of 8 Android devices per WiFi hotspot.

This solution isn't just applicable to road trips, but any situation where long distance communication is necessary as it is small, light weight and low power.

The off-grid LoRa communicator is a communication gateway for mobile devices based on ESP8266/SX1278. The SX1278 LoRa solution claims transmission distances of up to 10KM and the ESP8266 provides a 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi compatible hotspot for mobile devices. Both these chips are small and power efficient which allow ease of use in mobile applications such as hiking or in vehicles.

Currently, in this POC stage, the off-grid LoRa communicator allows up to 8 mobile devices to connect to it simultaneously to send and receive text messages in a group chat like fashion. When a message is sent on one side it is transmitted via the LoRa communication standard to the other side where messages are delivered to the connected devices via the included app.

There is no real limit to the number of off-grid LoRa communicators provided the number of messages being sent at any one time isn't too high, receiving messages doesn't add any overhead. This allows messages to be broadcast to many people at once, provided there is a use case for such a situation.

I built the off-grid LoRa communicator on perf-board and 3D printed a case to house it securely. The case supports holes for an SMA connector for the antenna, serial/debug interface and power. The plan is to later build a custom PCB to reduce the device footprint as well as add additional features such as a charging controller for LiPo batteries and then enclose it in a water resistant case.

Code written on the ESP8266 ensures any connected clients receive incoming messages, allows clients to send messages and handles sudden disconnects/reconnects gracefully by keeping track of device MAC addresses. New sockets are opened for new devices and existing open sockets are reassigned to existing clients should they reconnect after disconnecting.

Currently I have only developed an app for Android, this app is still in early stages and for now just serves as a POC. Improvements to UI and additional features will be added in the future as well as the possibility for iOS support. When first started the app will prompt the user for a username to use for all communication. In addition a foreground service is started to monitor a socket for incoming and outgoing messages. This allows the app to be closed or minimised to the background while still giving the user notifications for incoming messages. The service will continue to run even when disconnected from the LoRa station hotspot and will continually attempt to reconnect as long as it is running. The user has the option of stopping the service from within the app, the service will automatically restart if the app is opened.

Here is a simple demonstration of the app with two other devices.

Although still in its early stages this project has a few advantages over existing projects such as Meshtastic.

State Representative Bob Merski says they have made a big first step, but they still have a long way to go.

The Pennsylvania Environmental and Renewable Energy Committee passed a bill Tuesday sponsored by Merski.

The idea is to enable the state to lease land for water, solar, or wind energy on Lake Erie.

""As the technology advances and we can move toward renewables, we can then decrease some of the fossil fuels that are polluting the environment, but I think this is a step that they are doing in other places,"" said Merski.

This bill was originally championed by State Representative Curt Sonney and then continued by Merski after Sonney's retirement.

""Everybody was at the table putting in their input and taking things out that they thought were bad things, so we feel that this bill protects the environment in a way that strengthens it from the original bill,"" said Merski.

""This action, if adopted, would help advance Pennsylvania's clean energy goals,"" said Matt Walker, advocacy director for the Clean Air Council. ""It can benefit the health of Pennsylvanians and provide good paying jobs.""

One Ohio-based foundation supports renewable energy but raised some environmental concerns after studying a previous wind turbine project.

""The cables that are laid on the floor of the lake from the wind turbines to the city, all those impacts have to be assessed on what the result will be to those different parts of the environment,"" said Matt Fisher, Lake Erie Foundation.

Fisher also brought up concerns with temporary jobs, cost and the lake's overall beauty.

""We love Lake Erie, and this is going to turn Lake Erie into an industrial park and I don't think that's what we want to do,"" said Fisher.

The tattered notebook found next to the mummified remains of 13-year-old Talon Vance started in a cheerful tone, but soon took a dark turn as he chronicled his sadness of having to leave his friends and his mental breakdown at an Arby's fast food restaurant.

Talon weighed less than 40 pounds when he was found dead in July 2023 outside of a tent where the bodies of his mother Rebecca ""Becky"" Vance, 42, and 41-year-old aunt, Christine Vance, 41, were found.

The trio left their Colorado home in 2022 to permanently live off the grid in a tent near Gold Creek Campground, about an hour's drive from Gunnison, Colorado, in an attempt to ""escape society.""

In the days before they left, Talon told his online Roblox gaming friends goodbye, which he wrote about in 24 pages in his journal, according to Tom Conover with Outside Magazine.

""NOOO COME BACK,"" a gamer with the username Fluffy wrote.

""Please I will give anything for you to come back,"" another wrote.

At one point during their trip, they stopped at Arby's for food and Talon wrote about how he was having a mental breakdown because ""nothing feels the same.""

""I also had a mini breakdown at Arby's because nothing feels the same anymore [sad face],"" he wrote.

He also wrote about going to the grocery store with his aunt, who let him pick out a treat.

""During my breakdown, she took us to Safeway and let me pick out candy of my choice! I was so sad, that nothing really sounded appealing to me anymore. So I picked out chocolate for mommy mostly, and then Aunty suggested fruit snacks for me, so I just said 'OK.'""

Family members still reeling from their tragic outcome said they didn't know their escape would be a permanent one.

Becky's stepsister, Trevela Jara, told The Independent she couldn't even bring herself to read the journal entries.

Talon's half-sister, Emma, who provided copies of the journal entries for Conover, told him the pages smelled like smoke from a campfire, he said.

None of the three had outdoor survival experience, according to family members, but some of the entries revealed Talon's mother had been trying to prepare him for the trip by encouraging him to learn survival skills, including how to tie knots.

""Square knot! Right over left, Left over right,"" he wrote, ending the entry with a smiley face.

He also detailed how to tie a clove hitch, bowline, Japanese square lashing, and timber hitch, exclaiming: ""Side note: I did the trucker's hitch first try!!""

Just before the family left Colorado Springs, he wrote about having to leave his ""stinky"" cat Oreo behind.

""Oreo always plopped on our laps when we were on the couch,"" he wrote. ""On the 29th of July, Oreo plopped between me and mommy as we were practicing ropes and knots. During online school, I would work on the couch a lot of the time. Because of that, Oreo would plop on me. On the 29th of July, Oreo plopped on me for the last time.""

The cat was left behind with Trevela Jara before the trio left for their trip.

Ms Jara previously told The New York Times that her stepsister was so ""discouraged with the state of the world"" that she was set on living in a remote destination away from modern stressors.

""She went for good intentions,"" she said. ""She thought she was protecting her son and our sister, Christine, because she didn't want them to get wrapped up in what the world was coming to in her eyes.""

The Covid-19 pandemic only intensified her uneasiness with the state of the world, Ms Jara added.

Becky's sister Christine initially did not want to go, but ended up joining the mother-son duo ""because she thought that if she was with them, they had a better chance of surviving.""

In July 2023, Gunnison County officials located three ""heavily decomposed"" bodies at the Rocky Mountain campsite after a hiker noticed one of the corpses, which turned out to be Talon. The sisters' bodies were found inside the tent nearby.

Their shelter, later described by investigators as an ""eighty-dollar Walmart tent,"" was not warm enough for the harsh winter in the wilderness and they did not have the appropriate equipment to survive.

While no firearms or knives were found at the site, investigators did find a fishing rod, however, the lakes are frozen and inaccessible in winter.

They seek to attract trade investment, boost trade volumes, create better job opportunities, reduce poverty, and increase economic prosperity in Africa.

On March 14, 2024, stakeholders in digital trade protocols gathered at the LA Palm Royal Beach Hotel to discuss the role of stakeholders in advancing digital trade in Africa. They assessed the implementation and impact of the AfCTA Digital Trade Protocol in Ghana, aiming to leverage trade barriers and restrictions that have hindered trade investment in the country and Africa as a whole.

The event was organized by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, ODI.org, and the Global Policy House, with support from the UK International Development and Supporting Investment Trade in Africa (SITA).

Key issues discussed by stakeholders included digital trade and e-commerce as catalysts for addressing trade restrictions, the potential contribution of the digital trade protocol to GDP growth in Ghana, and the role of the private sector in achieving the objectives of the AfCTA Digital Trade Protocols to benefit African people.

Mr. Seidu, representing the private sector, highlighted that well-implemented AfCTA Digital Trade Protocols could promote cohesive intra and inter-trading activities within Ghana and beyond. He emphasized the importance of addressing cybersecurity, data protection, and internet penetration, suggesting inter-agency collaboration and political will to achieve these goals.

AfCTA reiterated the challenges facing trade investment in Africa, including trade restrictions, inefficient cross-border payments, and the need for progress in driving digital trade. Collaboration between AfCTA Digital Trade and the private sector, focusing on capacity building, technical assistance, and digital infrastructure, was emphasized.

Mitchelle Chivunga, Africa Director of Global Policy House, emphasized the importance of facilitating digital trade and investment by reducing trade restrictions, harmonizing standards, and improving digital infrastructure. She called for safeguarding the sanctity of digital transactions and focusing on SMEs in the implementation of the AfCTA Digital Trade Protocol to address unemployment.

Statistics provided by ODI suggest that Ghana's potential economic gains from the AfCTA Digital Trade Protocol could significantly enhance GDP growth and export values if well implemented.

The forum was attended by representatives from various organizations, including ODI, the Institute of Liberty and Policy Innovation (ILAPI), and the Ghana Chamber of Commerce, as well as government ministries and private sector advocates in digital trade protocol.",modernghana.com,news,Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd.,,0.2941176470588236,448840965,1,https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/322202424731-uaqctgfsrn-afcta-digital-trade-protocols.jpg,

Ganduje The APC National Chairman, who disclosed this at Nnewi at the colloquium organized by the Southeast chapter of APC on Friday, 22nd March 2024 said the marginalization of South East is rather a result of miscalculations by the people of the South East.

He said such miscalculations have kept Anambra State in political dislocation, and that it would continue to be so until the state dumps the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).

Ganduje said: ""We are here for the South East colloquium, but I prefer to speak about Anambra where we are Igbo are part of ingredients of national integration, they are the most travelled and most enterprising people in Nigeria. They are creative, innovative, and competitive and this is the basis of the Nigerian economy today.

""Anambra is not making the progress needed. Anambra has had Peter Obi, Obiano and now Soludo all from APGA as its governors, and that is 25 years of political dislocation for this state.

""They need to join the ruling political party and they will be happy and better for it. Why should Anambra continue to live in isolation? If there had been superlative performances on that isolated platform it would have been a different thing. This is a vivid case of selfish politics.

""Other states have joined APC, but Anambra's refusal to connect to the centre has denied her people the infrastructure and other benefits. You have to be at the table to negotiate what comes to you and if you are not on the table, no one will speak for you. Anambra is the only place where APGA is in government and the party has refused to grow.""

Also, Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma who was at the colloquium said the good thing about the colloquium is that the APC has also come to agree that the South East is marginalized.

""The good thing is that the National Chairman of our party is part of the team of doctors that diagnosed this. There is a need for national integration, cohesion and unity so that we can have a pan-Nigerian project.

""If we are craving for a Nigeria where equity and fair play will prevail, then we must be in the room where the affairs of the country will be discussed. We must rise from this room and resolve to be a part of the ruling party.

""We must go with capable men and women who will enjoy acceptance. We only need to understand the Nigerian political demography and create a corridor that we can use to exit from this political isolation.

""I'm here to welcome Ifeanyi Ubah into our party. He has proven to understand the dynamism required to navigate the political sphere. He came to the Senate through an unknown political party and if he can associate with a known political party, he will do more.

""A time will come when those who helped Igbo to escape political marginalization will be counted. I want to be counted as one who participated in creating an escape corridor for Ndigbo to escape marginalization.""",newtelegraphng.com,news,New Telegraph,"New Telegraph, Echezona Okafor",0.1843137254901961,448840847,1,https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ganduje.jpeg,eng-9418948

Army Gen. Randy George discussed some of the advancements this morning when talking with Defense One digital media platform in Washington.

""We've all seen how the battlefield is changing, [and] we know that you can't have these big C2 [command and control] nodes that are out there,"" George said. ""We know that machines can do a lot of things right now much more effectively and much cheaper, and we're going to have to incorporate them into our formations.""

George spoke to Defense One after having just returned from observing Project Convergence Capstone 4, an experiment involving the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Space Force. Dubbed PC-C4, the two-phase, joint and multination experiment took place at Camp Pendleton, California, and the Army's National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California, from Feb. 23 through March 20.

Led by Army Futures Command, Project Convergence is a series of experiments that gives warfighters the opportunity to experiment with technology at the operational level and further refine methods for synchronizing as a joint force.

""Technology is moving really fast,"" said George, ""and [PC-C4] kind of gave us an opportunity to see just how we could do that.""

As an example of how advanced technology can be integrated into the Army's formations, George explained that he got to observe a light infantry company that was operating in a simulated urban environment while incorporating robotic dogs and unmanned aircraft systems to sense the environment.

""That was all tied together by a very simple command and control network that was easy to use and intuitive,"" said George. ""It was amazing.""

George said that the hands-on approach to innovation during experiments like PC-C4 can be very advantageous when compared to more conventional, top-down innovation.

""I think there's nothing like testing ... in the environments that you know you're going to need to operate in; this isn't about testing something in a showroom,"" remarked the general. ""This is actually getting to use [the technology] where they're going to use it ... and I think that's where we do our best learning.""

In terms of a timeline for integration of modernization capabilities, George said that depends on future budgets, and while there is no specific date or timeline for all modernization, the Army is focused on ""incremental improvement.""

""We do have a sense of urgency,"" he said. ""I think everybody is anxious to transform.""",defense.gov,news,U.S. Department of Defense,,0.2470588235294118,448838022,1,https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/14/2003413476/1280/1280/0/240311-A-YM380-1001.JPG,

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Somehow, she's done it again. Martha Stewart set the internet ablaze this week by way of a chilling photo posted blithely to her personal Instagram. The photo, which has nearly 30,000 likes and thousands of horrified comments, shows a dish from an apparent meal at New York City's Café Boulud: On a wooden serving board, strewn with decorative shells and strands of seaweed, sits a chicken that has somehow, through dark magic or culinary masterminding, merged with a lobster.

The chicken itself would look unremarkable, were it not for the lobster head poking out from its breast bone, claws that appear to be attached to the wings, and, perhaps most disconcertingly, a lobster's tail emerging from the hollow cavity at the back, curling up to meet the chicken's thighs. The effect is something that looks like an evolutionary accident or what would happen if a mad scientist had a little extra time on his hands.

As it turns out, the dish is none of those things. Though Martha innocently captions it as ""roast chicken and lobster,"" it is, in fact, the ""poularde homardine, sauce nantua"" at Café Boulud. It's listed on the restaurant's Maison Barnes menu, which is described as ""French traditional cuisine, with luxury items"" on its website. A note suggests the poularde homardine is large enough for three people, may take up to an hour to prepare, and costs $250. (Café Boulud hasn't responded to questions for comment.)

The lineage of the poularde homardine is murky. A poularde is a chicken that's been aged 120 days and fed a fatty diet, often seen in French fine cuisine, and homardine refers to a lobster sauce. A lone Instagram post from 2018 from Alain Passard, the French chef of three Michelin-starred L'Arpege in Paris, shows something similar -- a roasted chicken reclining on a plate, a lobster head and claws emerging from the rear cavity, as if the chicken were in the midst of giving birth to the lobster. It's captioned, simply, ""poularde homardine."" Passard's plating isn't quite the same as Café Boulud's, but the thought process no doubt was: What if we shove a lobster inside a chicken.

As it always does, the internet came to my rescue in the end. As executive chef Romain Paumier explained to Slate, the dish ""is a classic, but it's usually made with crayfish."" The recipe, he says, uses every part of the lobster, but it was Paumier's own creative flair that led to the unique plating -- there's technically no reason this dish should look so monster-like. The dish is essentially the French-est surf and turf imaginable: The chicken is cooked with the lobster head to infuse its briney flavor into the bird, and then the head is squeezed into a sauce used for the base of a lobster bisque. The lobster tail -- you know, that thing poking out of the back of the chicken? -- is simply poached and finished with butter. Easy! Simple! No fuss dining! A gloriously terrifying moment in the French culinary wave that we never asked for.

IKEA will debut plant-based hot dogs in the States

The furniture giant known for its annoying construction kits (put the screw where?) and excellent Swedish treats is clamoring atop the precarious fake meat bandwagon with its new Plant Dog. IKEA's marketing team says the new rice protein option -- unlike the chain's original plant-based dog, featuring kale, quinoa, and lentils for a veggie-forward flavor and texture -- has the same ""snap"" as a traditional hot dog. After debuting in Europe last year, it's now available for 70 cents at US stores and should fit perfectly inside this six-inch Beräkna vase. -- Ali Francis, staff writer

Gwyneth Paltrow hates dill

The Goop maven, known for her strong opinions (remember how she told us all to fill our butts with coffee?), recently spat another one out on a Hot Ones episode: ""I love all herbs,"" Paltrow said, ""except for dill, which should be illegal."" As a Polish citizen with dilly borscht running through my veins, this one felt personal. And over in the Bon Appétit newsroom, I saw my team's true colors. ""I too hate dill,"" wrote editorial director Serena Dai, who until this point, had my undying respect. Li Goldstein, our very wise digital production assistant, came to dill's defense: ""This feels sponsored by big basil,"" she wrote. Long live dill. -- A.F.

But as a combination sleeper who needs pressure relief and support in all the right areas, I need something that provides the best of both worlds. That's where the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress enters the picture.

It's a budget-friendly option that has no syrupy, slow-moving feel but does have a lot to offer for your dollar. For peace of mind, the foam is all CertiPUR-US Certified, and the springs add airflow and superior edge support. As a bonus, all Leesa mattresses are designed and assembled in the U.S. My Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress review assesses several criteria, from motion transfer to support and all the categories in between. After sleeping on it for over a month, here's everything you need to know about the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress, including who I think would love it most.

While it might sound like a cliché, the best way to describe the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress is that it truly offers the best of both worlds with its supportive springs and pressure-relieving foam. The bed is 11 inches thick, although the brand states that dimensions can vary up to 2 inches on any side due to being handmade.

Leesa describes the firmness of this mattress as a 6 to 8 (out of 10), which is considered medium to medium-firm. For the first few nights, I put this mattress at an 8, as it felt fairly firm to me (5 foot 3 inches and 130 pounds). By the end of the month, it had settled in closer to a 6 or 7.

I need to note that my husband, who is 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, has a slightly different experience than I do. He describes it as a 5 or 6, and he feels like he sleeps in the mattress. (In general, the heavier you are, the softer a mattress feels.) My husband sleeps on his back, side and stomach, and he finds the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress supportive and comfortable in all positions. However, if you're over 200 pounds, I wouldn't recommend it for stomach sleeping.

The feel is unique, and I can't compare it to my previous innerspring and pillow top mattress at all. It does have some give (for example, when you push hard into the bed, it leaves a small spot that slowly fills back in), but I sleep on the mattress and not in the mattress. This makes it ideal for me as a combination sleeper, since it's effortless to switch positions, and I feel like my pressure points are contoured but still supported. I'm also comfortable sleeping on my back.

As a bed-in-a-box, the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress arrived in a compact, albeit heavy, box. I had to ask my husband to move it into the bedroom and onto the bed frame. The mattress starts to expand as soon as you cut open the plastic, and the brand recommends allowing a full 24 hours before you fully try to experience all the features. I slept on the mattress after about 10 hours, and while it was comfortable, it felt very firm. However, it continued to soften up over the next week or two.

Coming from an innerspring mattress with a pillow top, this hybrid foam model was an adjustment, and I definitely felt the difference in my muscles during the first week. But the adjustment period was fairly short, and I was completely used to the mattress by Week Two. I also didn't notice any odor. Overall, I would recommend the mattress to friends and family, as it's comfortable for many sleeping positions and styles; I'd especially recommend it to couples, since it's so great at deadening motion across the bed.

The combination of springs and foam offers the perfect balance of pressure relief for most sleeping positions (although this also depends on your weight).

For a small person who is 130 pounds, I experienced the mattress like a true medium-firm, while also getting superior cushion and contour from the foam. I usually read or watch a TV show before bed while lying on my back, and the pressure relief is ideal for those few hours. I don't get achy or feel the need to adjust positions. Compared to my previous mattress, this hybrid provides much better pressure relief and support while sleeping on my stomach. I do feel a little bit of pressure on my shoulder when I sleep on my side, as this might be slightly too firm for a person of my size.

On the other hand, my husband, who weighs 180 pounds, sinks into the mattress a bit more than I do and experiences the Leesa Original Hybrid as closer to a true medium. However, this works to his advantage as a combination sleeper, since he can get that pressure relief in multiple positions without it feeling too soft while on his stomach or too firm against his side.

According to Leesa, this hybrid mattress should be cooling, thanks to the breathable knit cover, high-airflow foam and the springs, which also offer additional airflow. I don't sleep too hot or too cool, and I thought this mattress was the perfect temperature. But it didn't seem extra cooling, either.

It was helpful to get my husband's feedback, as he tends to get very hot at night. He thinks this mattress sleeps hotter than our last innerspring mattress and has had a couple of sweaty nights over the past month. So we definitely need to add a cooling mattress topper to keep him comfortable at night. While this mattress might feel cooler than your average memory foam mattress, which has a tendency to hold heat, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who sleeps hot.

My husband and I have entirely different sleep schedules, so motion isolation is an important feature. I stay up late to read most nights, and he gets up hours before I do to get ready for work. In more than 30 days of testing, I didn't once feel my husband get up for work. Overall, the mattress does a great job of limiting motion transfer. Now, I wouldn't put a glass of wine on the bed and jump next to it unless you want a mess, but the motion transfer is low enough that getting in and out of bed shouldn't jostle a partner.

The Leesa Original Hybrid has above-average edge support, thanks to the hundreds of individually wrapped springs that go all the way to the perimeter of the mattress. In fact, if you put your hand on the side of the mattress, you can clearly feel the coils. The center provides the same level of support as the rest of the mattress.

The brand says that it can support individual weights up to 350 pounds. While I do think it's supportive enough for heavier weights, they'd have a different experience than those who weigh less. For example, I wouldn't recommend it for heavyweight people who sleep on their stomachs because of its softer feel. But it offers great support for me as a 130-pound stomach sleeper.

If there's one thing I despise about old-school memory foam mattresses, it's feeling stuck as a combination sleeper, and the difficulty of changing positions at night. While this hybrid model has several layers of foam, it also has a bit of bounce that makes it effortless to move without feeling stuck. Sometimes I woke up in a different position than the one I fell asleep in, and I didn't remember waking up.

Leesa was founded in 2015 and considers itself a pioneer of the bed-in-the-box concept. All of its mattresses are made in the U.S. with premium designs and conscious manufacturing. Part of the brand's mission is giving, and they've donated tens of thousands of mattresses to those in need. As far as construction, Leesa mattresses only use CertiPUR-US-certified foams and are Greenguard Gold-certified, meaning you don't have to worry about bringing harmful substances into your home. Plus, the springs are crafted using mostly recycled steel.

Leesa offers free, no-contact delivery to all 50 states in the U.S. for its mattresses. Beds are also made to order and assembled within three to seven business days. However, you can also add white-glove delivery for a charge, which includes in-home delivery, setup and old mattress removal. The in-home setup and removal service requires an extra seven business days.

The Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress comes with a 100-night trial period, and customers must try it for at least 30 nights before returning. If you do wish to initiate a return it, it's free (except for a $100 fee for those in Hawaii and Alaska), and the brand typically recommends a place to donate (since they can't re-sell your mattress). However, only the first Leesa mattress to your household includes the 100-night trial and option to return. Exchanges are treated similarly to returns.

A 10-year warranty is included with all Leesa mattresses, which includes replacing or repairing any part of a defective mattress. No deductible is required. The warranty is void if the mattress leaves the U.S. or Canada, or if the mattress changes ownership.

If you love this mattress but need a model that keeps you cool, the Leesa Sapira Chill Mattress has a similar spring-and-foam construction but is designed with additional cooling features, like gel-infused foam and a cover infused with cooling fibers.

For a fully foam model that offers more of that telltale sinking feeling, consider the Leesa Original Mattress. It delivers superior contouring and pressure relief for side sleepers and that same bounce as the hybrid model to suit combination sleepers.

Overall, the Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress should work for a variety of people and sleeping styles. First and foremost, if you want the pressure-relieving benefits of memory foam without feeling like you're stuck in the bed, this model is a top contender. Back, stomach and combo sleepers who weigh less than 150 pounds should find this mattress comfortable. If you're between 150 and 200 pounds, it would best accommodate side, back and combination sleepers. My husband and I also appreciate the minimal motion transfer.

I would skip this mattress if you tend to get really hot at night or want that true memory foam sink-in feeling.

It is now eyeing a significant uptick in revenue this year by doubling down on the hybrid work model.

MoveInSync said it earned a revenue of Rs 65 crore in FY 2022, and is now looking to clock Rs 350 crore in revenue by the end of this fiscal -- a 5X growth. It aims to double that figure to Rs 700 crore in the next fiscal.

The company said it turned profitable in FY 2017, however, the pandemic years of 2020-21 and 2021-22 put a dent in its business and made it incur losses. Now, MoveInSync said it again turned profitable in the previous fiscal, however, has refused to divulge its profit numbers.

""We are absolutely delighted to continue our growth story. Over the last six months, we have grown more than 100% with enterprises rapidly bringing back employees to work. We have seen this trend globally. Our growth is driven by the need for enterprises to optimise employee productivity at various levels-be it in commute or at work itself,"" said Deepesh Agarwal, Co-founder and CEO of MoveInSync, in a press release.

The company helps enterprises such as Google, Microsoft, Infosys, Wipro, Facebook, and Amazon to transport over 500,000 employees per day. It uses patented algorithms to ensure optimum vehicle utilisation and employee commute time.

However, it had to hit pause in 2020 when the pandemic struck and lockdowns were announced all over the world. This was when it came up with a hybrid work platform -- WorkInSync -- that enables employees to return to the office.

Now, as offices globally are asking their employees to come to work some days of the week, MoveInSync has seen rapid growth in its business. It plans to enter new markets such as the Philippines and Ghana, in addition to bolstering its operations in countries including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, South Africa, and Jamaica.

According to the data collected by the company's platform from over 200 global enterprise customers across 24 countries, over 80% of the workforce is now back in the office but in a hybrid manner. MoveInSync expects this number to cross 100% of pre-COVID-19 levels by early next year.

The company has 500 employees on its payroll and is looking to add another 200 in the next 12 months as it embarks on its expansion strategy.

This is something that has been in the works for quite some time now. And, like Apple, Meta has stated this feature will be exclusive to the EU region. After having been accused of gatekeeping, this new addition will allow WhatsApp to send and receive messages from other apps.

Meta's WhatsApp has always been a closed app. Users couldn't integrate it with any other app, let alone rival messaging platforms. The European Union, in its crusade against unfair monopolies, deemed this a problem that needed solving. Like its many cases against Apple, the EU has forced Meta to adopt changes to continue operating in EU countries.

Meta last talked about the upcoming WhatsApp third-party integration back in March. Much to the chagrin of many users, Meta said the feature would be EU-exclusive. This follows Apple's strategy of only applying changes where required by the law.

WhatsApp's third-party integration will allow users to send and receive messages from rival messaging apps. This includes Signal and the very popular but somewhat controversial Telegram. The new feature will no longer require users to switch between different applications to participate in different chats. Meta has been firm that it will uphold all necessary encryption standards to protect user privacy and data.

As is common, TheSpAndroid dove into the app and found partially complete code to share. It seems WhatsApp third-party integration will be a manual option for users. Those who want to make use of it will have to enable it themselves. Users will access this feature under Settings > Account > Third-party chats. They can also go into Selected apps to manually choose which apps they're comfortable sharing their phone number with. Chosen apps will allow users of those apps to look up WhatsApp users via phone number.

Similar to what Apple did when forced to allow third-party app downloads, WhatsApp shows a warning. This warning message tells users that scams are more likely in third-party chats. It also warns users that other apps handle user data differently to WhatsApp. The UI for WhatsApp's third-party integration can be seen in a video released by TheSpAndroid. It's worth noting this feature is likely to only support basic text messages alongside media sharing. Group chats, stickers, reactions, and disappearing messages are unlikely to be available on launch.",androidheadlines.com,news,Android Headlines,Abdullah Asim,-0.02745098039215688,448835559,1,https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Channels-official-1-jpg.webp,

The GLC SUV offers a compelling combination of design and technology coupled with impressive performance, as well as comfort and agility. The introduction of the new plug-in hybrid variant completes the range of the brand's highly successful SUV family.

The sophisticated hybrid drive system of the GLC 350e 4MATIC SUV consists of a 134 hp permanently excited electric synchronous motor with internal rotor paired with a 24.8 kWh battery, contributing to a combined system output of up to 313 hp and 406 lb.-ft. of combined system torque. The electric motor offers 325 lb.-ft. of instantly available torque for agile acceleration. Mercedes‑Benz also uses a vacuum-independent, electromechanical brake booster that seamlessly combines electric recuperation with the hydraulic brakes to achieve the best possible energy recovery depending on the driving situation. As a result, maximum recuperation power of up to 100 kW can be achieved more frequently than with a conventional, purely hydraulic brake system.

With an electric range of up to 130 kilometers (~81 miles) according to WLTP, drivers can cover most everyday trips without using the vehicle's internal combustion engine. Further optimizing efficiency, the ""Hybrid"" drive program utilizes the ""Electric"" drive mode for the most appropriate driving situations. For example, during city driving, the GLC 350e prioritizes electric propulsion. An ""Off-Road"" drive mode enables the plug-in hybrid to drive electrically on off-road terrain. All-electric driving is possible up to 87 mph. With the standard 60 kW DC charger, a full charge can be achieved in around 30 minutes.

The GLC 350e 4MATIC SUV mirrors the same progressive exterior and interior design as the GLC 300 and GLC 300 4MATIC SUVs, which are already available in the U.S. Customers can choose from 11 different paint color options, including four MANUFAKTUR paints, 13 different upholstery options and eight wheel options across the three trim packages (Standard, Exclusive and Pinnacle). Interior highlights include the new floating 12.3-inch digital instrument panel along with an 11.9-inch central display that rises seamlessly from the center console. Consistent with the all-new E-Class and CLE, the GLC 350e also offers the third generation of the MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment system, providing an expandable portfolio of in-car apps, as well as the new Routines function.

The hybrid model will come extremely well-equipped, building upon a host of standard equipment, including heated front seats, Mercedes-Benz Navigation, KEYLESS-GO, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, KEYLESS-START, power liftgate, Frontbass® audio system, Blind Spot Assist, Adaptive Highbeam Assist, Rearview camera, PARKTRONIC with Active Parking Assist and much more. Each trim level showcases a variety of comfort features and technologies, in addition to a range of options to enable customers to further tailor the vehicle to their individual lifestyle.

Mercedes me Charge, which comes standard with the GLC 350e 4MATIC SUV, is an essential part of the Mercedes electric charging ecosystem. This service integrates multiple charging point operators (CPOs) into a single network, including ChargePoint, Electrify America and EVgo. With access to nearly 100,000 public charging points nationwide, Mercedes me Charge is already one of the largest integrated charging networks in the U.S., and Mercedes-Benz is working to improve customer availability and convenience even further.

In November 2023, the first Mercedes-Benz Charging Hub in North America opened, the first step in Mercedes-Benz's commitment to invest more than $1 billion in a joint venture with MN8 Energy, to deliver 2,500 high-power, branded chargers within at least 400 charging hubs across North America by the end of the decade. In February 2024, the IONNA joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and six other automakers also received approval from regulatory agencies, paving the way for a minimum of 30,000 additional high-powered chargers across North America.

IBM is often portrayed as the sleeping giant that's falling into deeper sleep. What is IBM up to now? How should enterprises assess its future and their future with IBM? The answer is platforms.

As recently as 20 years ago, a platform in computing meant a computer system. Application software, even then, was the critical ingredient in turning something that could do little more than heat a room into an experience that people and businesses value. The computer -- the hardware -- was just what software needed to run. What IBM realized about that time, when considering the broad topic of AI that led to its Watson initiative, was that not only was hardware insufficient to build the foundation of software, but it wasn't even all that important.

What mattered was an emerging and growing software layer that sat between hardware and applications. This layer -- or platform -- consists of OSes, middleware and operations tools. It's the link between that applications layer and the business cases that drive IT spending.

IBM's platform strategy is what led it to abandon networking, which it sold to Cisco, and even personal computing, which IBM made into the business tool it is and then sold to Lenovo. It retained only its mainframe computers: the Z series and Power servers. The former were kept because the largest IBM customers, which were also the largest companies, had written their own software for these systems and the latter to accommodate a large base of enterprise software written for IBM's Advanced Interactive eXecutive, or AIX, OSes.

Over time, application evolution has eroded the software base for both types of hardware, and so hardware is less and less important to IBM's revenues. That's not a problem; it is a sign that the transition to the platform concept is almost complete.",techtarget.com,news,TechTarget,,0.1137254901960785,448832450,1,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/container_g1294273513.jpg,eng-9411436

Cleaning up these sectors will be critical if the White House wants to meet its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero by mid-century.

The Department of Energy, which is awarding the funding, had previously encouraged companies to file full applications for more than 100 proposals.

Among those, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is proposing to make steel using hydrogen, as well as another project to expand production of the metal for electrical transformers and electric-vehicle motors at its Butler Works plant north of Pittsburgh, according to one of the people. Century Aluminum Co., based in Chicago, was encouraged to proceed on at least two different proposals, including construction of the first primary smelter for the energy-intensive metal in the US in decades, the person said.

The Energy Department and the two companies didn't respond to requests for comment.

Almost $5.5 billion of the money for the grants will come from President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The Energy Department, which announced the funding last March, said at the time it would be used to ""drastically reduce industrial emissions"" and demonstrate first-of-a-kind or early-stage decarbonization technologies that had previously seemed decades away.

""We hear every day about industrial companies that are interested in decarbonizing their plants, but the initial costs can be daunting,"" said Nora Esram, a senior director for research with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington-based nonprofit.

The number of hybrid roles steadily increased after the pandemic hit, climbing from 18% in May of 2020 to 53% in November of 2023, according to data from Gallup. Since then, while the number of fully remote roles has nosedived, the share of hybrid jobs has held relatively steady, and a working model that would have been unthinkable to most people just a few years ago has become a fixture of modern life.

But managing these hybrid employees has become a leadership problem that companies have yet to solve, according to a new survey from software company TechSmith and research firm Global Workplace Analytics. Only about one quarter of companies have trained their people managers to successfully lead hybrid and distributed teams. And just one quarter of employees feel their organization has adequately supported them as they attempt to change how they work in hybrid environments. Those statistics mirror a recent Gallup report that found 70% of managers say they've received no formal training on how to manage hybrid teams.

""The problem is that while a majority of employers have embraced a change in the 'where' of work, many have not adopted new practices and processes to support it,"" the TechSmith report reads. ""This mismatch lies at the heart of many of the problems organizations and their people are struggling with today.""

Managing hybird employees comes with its own particular set of challenges.

When teams are spread out rather than consistently working together in the same space, there's a greater chance that workers will feel disconnected from each other and disengaged from the company when they're not properly managed, experts say. But there are some key qualities that managers can be trained in to avoid these pitfalls.

Hybrid managers need to be intentional in every aspect of the job, Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, tells Fortune. That includes setting specific goals, and being crystal clear with employees about what those are. ""What is it that you're expected to produce in a given week?"" she says. ""What's the level of cooperation you need to do that? And how am I going to measure it?""

Jim Harter, chief scientist of workplace management at Gallup, adds that setting up a workflow in which each member of a team understands their responsibility is key. ""What often gets forgotten in hybrid work is the accountability,"" he says.

Teaching bosses how to communicate well -- even if they're speaking through a computer screen -- is also a critical part of battling a sense of detachment on hybrid teams, according to Lister. That means being a careful listener, having meaningful and inclusive conversations with employees, and tailoring the approach to each individual.

""We have to be much more mindful about how we're bringing people into the conversation,"" she says. ""How different people communicate, and how they learn, and how they want to be rewarded.""

In 2023, Gallup studied managers who were trained to have more meaningful conversations with employees in the hopes of improving engagement in a hybrid environment. When managers began implementing these practices, engagement for their team as a whole rose as much as 18%, and engagement for managers themselves was as much as 22% higher. Turnover also dropped as much as 28%, and managers had a 28% higher likelihood of improved performance relative to their peers.

""It's important for companies to be thinking about [how teams are managed] because the trends are not going in the right direction,"" Harter says. ""It's not a difficult switch to flip, but once you do, a light just goes off in managers and they start to really listen and learn things about their teams and what they need to succeed.""",fortune.com,news,Fortune,,0.01960784313725483,448831463,1,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1356126149-e1711134411492.jpg?resize=1200,600",eng-9418958

The Dnieper Hydro Power Plant (HPP), a vital source of energy for Ukraine, has been severely damaged following a massive wave of Russian strikes, the head of the facility's operating company said on Friday.

The Dnieper HPP, located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. It was directly hit by two Russian missiles, the head of operator Ukrhydroenergo, Igor Sirota, claimed an interview with Radio Svoboda, a branch of the US-funded RFE/RL.

Zaporozhye Region voted to join Russia in the fall of 2022, although parts of the region are still held by Ukrainian troops.

The Ukrhydroenergo head offered a grim assessment of the situation at the Dnieper facility, saying ""we are losing the plant."" He added that the second unit of the plant had been hit, and that ""the support has been damaged... In other words, Dnieper HPP-2 is in critical condition, Dnieper HPP-1 is not operational either.""

Ukrhydroenergo is currently assessing the extent of the damage to the second unit, but a fire has complicated those efforts, Sirota added. It is clear at this point that the entire main generator hall and electrical equipment will need to be restored, he claimed, although he said there is no danger of a dam breach.

Sirota reported that no one was killed in the Russian strikes on the facility, although Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said there was one casualty.

A video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Russia missile moving toward the plant at high speed, before a powerful explosion rocks the facility.

Built in the early days of the Soviet Union during a period of large-scale industrialization, the Dnieper hydroelectric plant is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region and is a crucial source of energy for Kiev.

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched dozens of missiles and drones targeting the country's energy infrastructure in one of the most powerful barrages in weeks, causing widespread blackouts. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment.

His factory - which has 141 employees and supplies several well-known supermarkets - is now a stop closer to achieving Net Zero and running off grid.

The application for the turbine - which will be 500 metres from the historic village of Dunning and on the edge of a conservation area - received 79 objections including one from Dunning Community Council who described it as a ""totally unsuitable structure in a totally unsuitable location"".

Simon Howie Butchers was founded in December 1986 when Simon (now 57) opened his first small shop in Dunning. In 1997 a 10,000 square feet factory was opened and is now eight times the size. The business supplies Tesco, Aldi, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, the Co-op, Asda and Gleneagles Hotel.

PKC's Planning and Placemaking Committee met on Wednesday March 13 to consider the application for the 2.3MW 104m high turbine - with a hub height of around 69m - at Findony Farm, Dunning where Simon's family has been farming for over 100 years. The plans were recommended for approval by council officers.

Dunning Community councillor Colin Young told the councillors it was ""unacceptable"" for the tall turbine to be so close to the village. He said the visual amenity and character of the area ""would be seriously compromised"".

He added: ""It's a totally unsuitable structure in a totally unsuitable location.""

Objector Dr Gardner raised concern about shadow flicker and noise.

He said: ""A fair number of properties in Dunning have single glazing because they are listed and it's a conservation area.""

When asked by the committee's convener Ian Massie about shadow flicker, Greencat Renewables environment consultant Robert Collin pointed to a planning condition within PKC's report of handling. The condition asks for a shadow flicker management plan to be submitted to and approved in writing by PKC prior to the turbine being brought into operation. PKC has also put in place several conditions to address noise impact.

Perthshire businessman Simon Howie told councillors how the business was seeking to potentially run off grid. For over 10 years there has been no use of mains water or outfall from the factory as it is a closed loop system which comes from and goes back to land via a wetland ecological pond system.

In 2013 150Kw of solar panels were installed. This was stepped up to 2.1Mw of solar and 900Kw of battery back-up in 2023. The business has also installed two 15,000 litre water tanks - heated from electricity - displacing over 75 per cent of the gas required to heat the water. The business needs 30,000 litres of water per day- currently heated from gas - to wash down and clean the factory and equipment.

Mr Howie said he understood ""wind turbines are the Marmite of renewables"" but said the turbine would allow the company to generate electricity over the ""windy months"" from November to February - when there is less sunlight for the solar panels.

Members of the community had suggested the company install two or three smaller turbines as opposed to one giant turbine. Asked by Cllr Bob Brawn if it needed to be ""that high"", Mr Howie explained ""wind speeds are not fantastic there"" and the proposal was the ""optimal solution"".

He said they selected the site - 270m southwest of the factory and around 550m from the southern edge of the Dunning Conservation Area - because it was ""least impactful. Mr Howie said they could have generated four times as much power by putting it at the top of the hill but ""didn't think it would be appropriate"".

Conservative councillor Ian James moved to refuse the application because of the visual impact the ""huge structure"" would have on the historic area, describing wind turbines as a ""blight on our community"".

He was seconded by local Strathallan Conservative councillor Crawford Reid who said: ""Dunning Community Council does not object flippantly to planning applications. They are a solid group of people. They would not be objecting unless they were sure it was the right thing to do.""

SNP councillor Richard Watters - who convenes PKC's Climate Change and Sustainability Committee - moved for approval and said the council was ""looking to encourage businesses to improve their carbon footprint"". He was seconded by Bailie Mike Williamson.

The plans were approved by 11 votes to two.",dailyrecord.co.uk,news,Daily Record,Kathryn Anderson,0.03529411764705892,448830075,1,https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/article32382689.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Simon-Howie-Butchers-Findony-Farm-Dunning.jpg,

Floki, the dog-themed meme coin, has announced a new roadmap that includes offering regulated digital banking accounts and debit cards to its users. The project aims to allow users to fund their accounts using FLOKI tokens and transact in USD, EUR, and GBP.

""Users will be able to create digital bank accounts and generate debit cards linked to these accounts,"" the roadmap says.

According to the roadmap published by Floki developers, the project will introduce Floki-powered bank accounts in partnership with a fintech company licensed in Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE. Users will be able to create digital bank accounts denominated in EUR, USD, or GBP, and fund them with their FLOKI tokens. The accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs, enabling users to transact and transfer money globally.

In addition to bank accounts, Floki plans to launch debit cards on both the VISA and Mastercard payment networks. The cards will be issued in partnership with a Switzerland-based company regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

Floki's developers believe that these developments are part of a broader plan to transform the meme coin into a serious project that offers users a crypto-based financial application. The roadmap also includes plans for staking services, a crypto education platform called University of Floki, and a cross-chain trading bot powered by the FLOKI token.

Floki's integration with Venus, the largest lending protocol on the BNB chain, is expected to deepen the market liquidity available to FLOKI holders by allowing them to access more liquidity and borrow a wider range of assets using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.

The project also plans to introduce a decentralized domain name service and website hosting platform, allowing users to create their own .floki domain names and websites.

Earlier this year, Floki's staking program came under scrutiny from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The SFC warned users about the high annualized returns promised by Floki's staking program, ranging from 30% to over 100%, describing them as ""suspicious investment products."" In response to the SFC's warning, Floki has blocked Hong Kong-based users from joining its staking program.",cryptobriefing.com,news,Crypto Briefing,Diego Almada Lopez,0.2,448828083,1,https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22141131/DALL%C2%B7E-2024-03-22-12.03.34-shiba-inu-dog-ultrarealistic-golden-object-centered-background-is-a-solid-teal-color-gradient-depth-mockup-bright-lighting-aspect-ratio-of-8_4-m-800x457.webp,eng-9417773

Palou's biggest gain of time came in the first sector, where he hit a 40.0757s section, while the second-best time was a 40.3047s run by Armstrong.

Linus Lundqvist (Chip Ganassi Racing), Felix Rosenqvist (Meyer Shank Racing), Will Power (Team Penske), Callum Ilott (Arrow McLaren) and Scott Dixon (Chip Ganassi Racing) rounded out the rest of the top 10. Romain Grosjean (Juncos Hollinger Racing) was the first driver on the outside in 11th.

Although the track temperature started off at 80F, it warmed up to just over 100F by the end of the session.

There were no major incidents that brought out the caution, but there were a few off-track moments in Turn 2 for the likes of Santino Ferrucci (AJ Foyt Racing), Graham Rahal (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing) and rookie Christian Rasmussen (Ed Carpenter Racing).

Ed Carpenter Racing's Rinus VeeKay also went into a power slide that led to a brief off course excursion in Turn 6 in the final three minutes of the test.

Andretti Global's Marcus Ericsson suffered an issue in the final 20 minutes after his left-front caught fire on his No. 28 Honda. When he came down pit lane, the crew removed the tire and fragments of the brake system could be seen falling from the car. He ended up 12th when the checkered flag fell on the session.

All of the series' full time entries are at the facility, and plan to use the test runs to try out setups for later in the year and to prepare for the $1 Million Challenge on Sunday.

The session got off to a slow start as many of the drivers opted to wait in the pits for the track to warm up and rubber in before attempting to make their way around the course.

Less than half of the drivers set a flying lap in the first 30 minutes, but nearly everyone had sampled the course by time the one hour mark had passed.

Josef Newgarden was the final driver to take the 3.067-mile course, and ended his day in 20th after completing 13 laps.

Alex Palou was the fastest driver of the first session, completing his lap in 1 minute 39.5149 seconds. The reigning champion put in his fast lap early in the day, on the fourth lap out of 24 he ran.

Christian Lundgaard was the second fastest driver, followed closely by Marcus Armstrong in the #11 Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Alexander Rossi and Pato O'Ward were the fourth and fifth fastest, each pushing hard during their laps and putting their Arrow McLaren Chevys near the top of the timesheets.

The fastest rookie was Linus Lundqvist in sixth, continuing his impressive form early in his IndyCar career.

As a comparison, the next fastest rookie was Christian Rasmussen down in the 18th position.

There were no incidents to bring a stop to the session, although a few did test the limits and dip a couple tires off into the gravel. Multiple drivers noted the high degradation of the Firestone tires, setting up an interesting battle later in the weekend for the 20 lap race on Sunday.

As with any test session, overall pace is not necessarily the goal. Finding setups and trailing strategies is more important than showing your competition your best lap.

Those times are generally indicative of the balance of the cars and comfort level of the drivers, however, and can give a preview into who will be fighting for the big prize at the end of the weekend.

Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements revealed a typical carrier lifetime of 15.7 μs. For independent verification of such long carrier lifetime, we sent out the perovskite sample to a third-party laboratory for additional TRPL measurements, which gave a consistent result of 15.9 μs (Supplementary Fig. 2). The long carrier lifetime can be attributed to the substantially improved film morphology and crystallinity (Supplementary Fig. 3) due to the retarded the crystallization of the perovskite (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements revealed interaction between the BZM and the PbI, which made the FAI have to compete with BZM to interact with the Pb-I, thus resulting in the sluggish crystallization kinetics of perovskites (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the introduction of BZM led to the formation of low-dimensional perovskite phases (Supplementary Fig. 6). These low-dimensional perovskite phases could effectively passivate defects in the perovskite film when residing at the grain boundaries as evidenced by the enhanced PL intensity (Supplementary Fig. 7) which suggested reduced non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. Such long carrier lifetimes granted us an opportunity to make thicker perovskite films with sufficiently long charge carrier diffusion lengths to enable efficient charge collection. To systematically investigate the effects of film thickness on the optoelectronic properties of the films, we varied the thickness of the perovskite films by varying the concentration of PbI to be 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 M and the concentration of FAI/MACl proportionally adjusted accordingly. For convenience, the precursor concentrations, i.e., 1.4 M, 1.5 M, 1.6 M, 1.8 M, and 2.0 M, are used to represent the film thicknesses in this paper.

The carrier lifetime from both the top and bottom regions of these perovskite thin films was investigated by further TRPL measurements from either side of the samples. Figure 1b shows the statistics of the fitted TRPL results collected from 50 films with different thicknesses (Supplementary Figs. 8-19). All spectra were fitted with the single-exponential function and the average lifetime data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 (rear side) and Table 2 (front side). Negligible variation in the carrier lifetime was observed for the perovskite samples with various film thicknesses, which was in line with carrier lifetime extracted from the transient photovoltage decay measurements (Supplementary Fig. 20). Measured from either side of the samples, all films had similar carrier lifetimes, indicating the consistency between the top and bottom regions of the films. The charge carrier kinetics was further probed by transient reflection spectra (TRS) for the two most representative cases, i.e., the 1.4 M perovskite with the smallest film thickness (Fig. 1c), and the 2.0 M perovskite with the largest film thickness (Fig. 1d). The diffusion coefficient was extracted from the TRS measurements under a pump energy of 2.30, 1.90, and 1.65 eV. The 1.4 M and 2.0 M perovskites showed diffusion coefficients of 0.97 and 1.01 cm/s respectively (see Supplementary Note 1 for modeling details). Combining the TRPL and TRS results, the diffusion length was calculated to be 4.04 μm for the 1.4 M perovskite and 4.44 μm for the 2.0 M perovskite. This further confirms that the diffusion length is long enough to enable efficient charge transport and collection.

We subsequently evaluated the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite films with different thicknesses. PSC devices based on the 1.4 M perovskite yielded an average PCE of 23.1% under reverse scan with a stabilized power output of 22.3% as shown in Fig. 1e (best PCE 23.5%, Supplementary Table 3). However, the PCE successively decreased as the film thickness increased. As shown in Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22), the PCE dramatically dropped from an average PCE of 23.1% for the 1.4 M perovskite to an average PCE of merely 10.9% for the 2.0 M perovskite. The PCE decrease for the thicker films mainly originated from the dramatically reduced fill factor (from 0.77 to 0.45) as a result of the significantly increased series resistance (from 38.5 Ω to 116.0 Ω, Supplementary Table 4). Despite the long diffusion length of the 2.0 M perovskite, the device PCE is significantly lower than that of the 1.4 M perovskite, indicating the existence of separate factors, other than carrier diffusion length, that limited the PCE of thick-film PSCs.

We first examined the film chemistry to rule out any influence from composition variation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the perovskite films showed no obvious difference as the film thickness increased (Supplementary Fig. 23). We also performed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to study the distribution of chemical compositions throughout the film. The distribution profiles of Pb, Cs, FA, and In (as a reference to indicate the interface) were displayed in Supplementary Fig. 24. The perovskite thick film showed a very similar composition distribution to that of its thin film counterpart. These results ruled out the effect of the compositional distribution on the device performances.

As the fill factor and the series resistance in PSCs are highly related to the conductivity of the perovskite film, we investigated the conductivity dependence on the film thickness. Figure 2a shows statistics of the conductivity of the perovskite films collected by conductive atomic force microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 25), with the film thickness measured by a step profiler (Supplementary Fig. 8). The electrical conductivity of the perovskite film reduced as the film thickness increased. The conductivity dropped from 5.5 × 10S/m in the 1.4 M perovskite to 2.5 × 10S/m in the 2.0 M perovskite, which led to an increased series resistance and thus reduced PCE in thick-film PSCs. To obtain further insights into the underlying factors that affected the conductivity of the films, we studied the influence of lattice structures via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Supplementary Fig. 26). All samples exhibited two dominant diffraction peaks at around 14° and 28°, which can be assigned to the characteristic (001) and (002) planes of the α-phase perovskite. Notably, the (001) diffraction peak gradually shifted from ~14.07° to ~14.01° as the film thickness increased from 1.4 M to 2.0 M (Fig. 2b). The peak shift to lower diffraction angle indicated an expansion of the perovskite lattice with increasing thickness, which could be attributed to the strain effect induced by the substrate. In a relatively thinner perovskite film, the surface tension may impose greater strain effects that lead to the lattice compression. As the film thickness increases, strain relaxation results in the recovery of the lattice. The strain distribution within the film was further investigated through depth-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) by varying the incident beam angle from 0.3° to 1.0° with a step increase of 0.1° (see detailed information in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 27). As the incident angle varied from 1.0° to 0.5°, the diffraction patterns of the 1.4 M perovskite gradually shifted downwards from a Q value of 0.980 Å to 0.975 Å (Fig. 2c), suggesting a more pronounced compressive strain around the region closer to the substrate. In contrast, the strain effect vanished in the case of thicker films. Figure 2d shows the diffraction patterns of the 2.0 M perovskite. The peak position at ~0.975 Å was invariant as the incident angle ranged from 1.0° to 0.5°, suggesting that the lattice strain relaxed in the thicker film and became independent of the depth of the film. Figure 2e depicts the effect of film thickness on the lattice strain of perovskites, demonstrating the presence of lattice compression in thinner films, but strain relaxation in thicker films.

We subsequently investigated how lattice strain could have affected the conductivity of the perovskite films. Since conductivity is governed by carrier mobility and carrier concentration, we investigated these two factors for the 1.4 M and 2.0 M perovskite films. The space-charge-limited current technique was employed to measure carrier mobility. The electron and hole mobilities were obtained by constructing electron- or hole-only devices (Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 28 and Supplementary Tables 5-7, see Supplementary Note 3 for details of the calculation method). We observed a gradual increase in the electron mobility from ~10 to ~100 cm V s, whereas the hole mobility remained almost invariant as the film becomes thicker. Given the negligible changes in the carrier lifetime, the mobility increase could be ascribed to the change in effective mass as a result of the lattice strain. In light of this, we investigated the band dispersion of perovskites under different strain modes by first-principles calculations (Supplementary Figs. 29, 30). Figure 3c, d shows the band dispersion of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM), respectively, of perovskites under different strain modes (Supplementary Note 4). The results reveal a less dispersive CBM structure for the 1.4 M perovskite under compressive strain, indicating an increased electron effective mass of 0.103 m, as compared to that of 0.075m in the strain relaxed 2.0 M perovskite (Supplementary Table 8). The VBM band dispersion showed negligible difference between the 1.4 M and 2.0 M perovskites, suggesting a similar hole effective mass for the two cases. For the thicker perovskite film, a reduced electron effective mass but unaffected hole effective mass is consistent with the trends measured for the electron and hole mobilities, verifying the important role of strain in affecting the perovskite carrier mobility.

Given the opposite trend in the change of carrier mobility to that in conductivity, we further evaluated the carrier concentration in the thick perovskite films. The carrier concentration of the perovskite films can be derived from the slope of the capacitance-voltage (Mott-Schottky) plots (see the measurement and calculation details in Supplementary Fig. 31, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Note 5). The electron concentration (Fig. 3e) decreased from ~1.6 × 10 to ~0.5 × 10cm with increasing film thickness. Drive-level capacitance profiling also revealed a gradual decrease in carrier concentration as the perovskite film became thicker, further verifying the change in carrier concentration (Supplementary Fig. 32, Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 33). Two possible mechanisms could contribute to the carrier concentration change. On one hand, the compressive strain induced lattice distortion which led to the changes in effective mass as demonstrated above. As the carrier concentration is proportional to the effective mass, the carrier concentration would decrease for thicker perovskite films as a result of the decreased effective mass. On the other hand, the perovskite carrier concentration could also be affected by unintentional doping by shallow-level defects. Compressive strain would strengthen the chemical bonds and reduce the defect formation energies of some shallow-level defects (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 34). Therefore, though a thicker perovskite film exhibited a higher mobility, the low conductivity limited its PCE as a result of the strain-induced decrease in electron concentration. The strain-induced lattice distortion led to an increase in electron mobility and a decrease in electron concentration. The reduced electron concentration finally resulted in a decrease in the conductivity of the thicker perovskite films, and thus limited their photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the strain variation occurs closer to the bottom region of the films, which is towards the electron transporting layer. Therefore, the strain-induced variation in the electron behavior may have a more pronounced effect on the photovoltaic performance, which also in turn verifies the change in the electron concentration and electron mobility.

To further confirm that the strain effect is a critical factor limiting the PCE of thick-film PSCs, a strain regulation strategy (SRS) was designed to mitigate the strain relaxation for the thick perovskite films. In light of the interface-induced compressive strain, the SRS we devised involved a layer-by-layer deposition of perovskite films which introduced additional interfaces for strain-inducing. The PbI solution was first deposited onto the substrate, followed by the sequential deposition of the precursor solutions containing the organic cations. The first round of the precursor dripping led to the formation of a thin perovskite intermediate layer through the reaction between the pre-deposited PbI and the precursor solution containing organic cations (Supplementary Figs. 35, 36). XRD measurements revealed that this thin intermediate perovskite layer exhibited the same compressive lattice strain as the case of 1.4 M (Supplementary Fig. 37). This layer can thus serve as a foundation for maintaining strain continuity during the subsequent second-round deposition of the perovskite precursor. This approach ensured that the compressive strain was maintained within each thin perovskite layer, which can be seen as a ""quasi substrate"" to induce lattice strain, and finally led to the formation of a thick perovskite layer with compressive strain in a manner akin to epitaxial growth. XRD analysis in Fig. 4a, b verified the compressive strain retention for the perovskite films fabricated with SRS, which is observed by the similar peak position to that of the 1.4 M perovskite. Figure 4c shows the strain distribution of the thick-film perovskite with SRS as revealed by depth-resolved GIWAXS. Mimicking the case of the 1.4 M perovskite, the diffraction peak shifted from a Q value of 0.980 Å to 0.975 Å as the incident beam angle ranges from 1.0° to 0.7°, suggesting the existence of compressive strain around the bottom region of the film (see the schematic illustration in Supplementary Fig. 38). As SRS successfully allowed retention of the compressive strain in the thick perovskite film, the electron concentration increased (Supplementary Figs. 39-45). As a result, its conductivity enhanced from ~0.0025 to ~0.0060 S/cm (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 46). The PCE based on SRS improved from 10.9% (best 17.0%) for PSCs based on the 2.0 M perovskite to 22.9% (best 23.5%, certified 23.1%) (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figs. 47, 48). The fill factor improved from 0.45 to 0.75, with a reduced series resistance from 116.0 Ω to 38.5 Ω (Supplementary Fig. 49). The success of our SRS strategy further verifies the significance of compressive strain in constructing thick-film PSCs.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.04313725490196085,448826687,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-47019-8/MediaObjects/41467_2024_47019_Fig1_HTML.png,eng-9417099

The report states:

For the security integrator community in particular, change can be difficult when working with organizations that have always approached protection and defense in a certain way. Yet this barrier could also be an opportunity. Integrators should be seen as trusted advisors, helping customers navigate the complexities of new technology and overcome fear of change through support and education. The low confidence of some security professionals in the capabilities of current physical security systems shows just why this is so important.

New technologies can, if implemented correctly and with the right integration, give them an all-important confidence boost. Security integrators should jump on this opportunity and actively demonstrate their understanding of new technologies and their customers' needs from the get-go. Otherwise, they risk being left behind in the industry.

Brivo's 7th annual trends report is said to detail the most important changes for physical security teams across the globe. The report is based on 850 responses from security professionals across the United States, United Kingdom and Europe, asking the opinions of physical security teams in financial services, technology & IT, manufacturing, retail and more.

Among the key trends detailed in the report is the desire to integrate new security technology with existing systems to better manage people and facilities. Another key trend is high expectations of AI technology, with a need for greater skills and access to data.

The report also shows the continuing evolution of the CSO role in leading artificial intelligence (AI) implementations. While more important than ever, many lack the appropriate budget or authority to take full advantage of new technologies -- posing a challenge to upgrading security systems.

""This year's report has a lot to be optimistic about,"" said Steve Van Till, founder and CEO of Brivo, a provider of cloud-based access control and smart building technologies. ""The security industry wants to embrace new technologies, and there is investment and belief in new advances. At the heart of these changes will be the CSO, and they will need support to make this a success.

""Security integrators have an opportunity to be trusted advisors to the CSO.

With the integration of technology into education, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have emerged as indispensable tools, providing secure access to online resources and enabling seamless collaboration [1]. This article explores the synergy between hybrid learning and VPNs, highlighting their role in revolutionizing the educational landscape.

Hybrid learning, also known as blended learning, combines traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning components. It offers a flexible approach to education, allowing students to engage with course materials at their own pace while still benefiting from in-person interactions with instructors and peers.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) play a crucial role in enabling secure and seamless access to online resources in hybrid learning environments. VPNs encrypt internet traffic and route it through secure servers, protecting sensitive data from potential cyber threats. In the context of education, VPNs offer several advantages:

VPNs ensure secure access to Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and online course materials, safeguarding sensitive student information and intellectual property. By encrypting data transmissions, VPNs mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

VPNs allow students and educators to bypass geographical restrictions imposed by educational institutions or content providers. This enables access to online resources, digital libraries, and research databases that may be restricted based on geographic location.

In an era of increasing concerns about online privacy, VPNs help protect student privacy by masking IP addresses and encrypting internet traffic. This prevents third parties, including internet service providers (ISPs) and advertisers, from tracking students' online activities and behaviors.

VPNs facilitate secure remote collaboration by creating encrypted tunnels for communication and file sharing. This enables students and educators to collaborate on projects, participate in virtual meetings, and access shared resources without compromising data security.

While VPNs offer numerous benefits for hybrid learning, there are also challenges and considerations that educational institutions must address:

Deploying VPNs across educational institutions may require significant investment in infrastructure, software licenses, and technical support. Institutions must carefully evaluate the cost-effectiveness and scalability of VPN solutions to ensure sustainable implementation.

VPNs may introduce complexity and latency issues that impact the User Experience, particularly for students with limited technical proficiency or access to high-speed internet. Institutions should provide adequate training and support to ensure seamless integration of VPNs into hybrid learning environments.

Educational institutions must comply with data protection regulations and privacy laws when implementing VPNs, particularly concerning the collection and storage of student information. Institutions should establish clear policies and procedures for data handling and security to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Despite the enhanced security provided by cloud VPNs through encrypting internet traffic, they remain susceptible to cybersecurity risks. Institutions need to consistently monitor and update their cloud VPN configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities and defend against evolving threats like malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks.

As hybrid learning continues to evolve, there are exciting opportunities to further harness the potential of VPNs in education:

The convergence of hybrid learning and VPN technology holds immense potential to transform education, making learning more accessible, flexible, and secure. By leveraging the advantages of hybrid learning models and VPNs, educational institutions can empower students and educators to thrive in the digital age, fostering innovation, collaboration, and lifelong learning. As we embrace the opportunities and address the challenges of this transformative journey, we pave the way for a more inclusive, interconnected, and resilient education ecosystem.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

It's not the stately E-Class, nor is it the G-Wagon that has worked its way into cultural consciousness. Mercedes-Benz's best-seller is the humble GLC.

Mercedes' compact SUV is many people's entry point to the brand. Our expert test driver says, ""The comfort, technology (including many driver assistance functions), occupant space, quality, engines, and convenience features all add up to a compelling whole.""

But European buyers get access to a version we don't get in the U.S. - a fuel-sipping plug-in hybrid (PHEV) edition. Over there, it's called the ""GLC 300e."" But it's about to come stateside, where it will be called the ""2025 Mercedes-Benz GLC 350e.""

As far as we can tell, it won't have 50 more of anything.

Mercedes hasn't disclosed pricing. The gas-powered GLC starts at $48,250 (including the mandatory $1,150 destination charge). We would expect a PHEV version to land in the mid-$50,000 range.

Plug-in hybrids are like half-electric cars. They can travel for a set distance on electricity alone before using gasoline to go further. Owning one is like having an electric vehicle for around-town errands and a gas-powered car for road trips.

Mercedes announced the move this week, saying, ""The extensive standard offerings of the GLC 300 4MATIC SUV will carry over to the plug-in hybrid while adding more new standard features to enhance the electric experience further. The new plug-in hybrid model will arrive at U.S. dealerships in the second half of 2024.""

This GLC 350e uses a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine mated to an electric motor, good for a combined 313 horsepower and all-wheel drive (AWD).

The company hasn't declared its all-electric range in U.S. terms. In Europe, it advertises an all-electric range of 81 miles. However, European testing routinely results in far longer range figures than the formula used by America's EPA. Still, hitting two-thirds of that range would make it one of the longest-range PHEVs on the market.

""An 'Off-Road' drive mode enables the plug-in hybrid to drive electrically on off-road terrain,"" Mercedes says.

The company will offer the GLC350e in two trims - Exclusive and Pinnacle - matching the top two trims of the gas-only version.

Mercedes says it ""will arrive at U.S. dealerships in the second half of 2024.""",kbb.com,news,Kbb.com,Sean Tucker,0.05098039215686279,448825026,1,https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2025-mercedes-benz-glc-350e-front-quarter.jpg,eng-9421605

The Kia Niro PHEV Features An 11.1 kWh Battery

Close

Kia offers the Niro as a fully electric car, featuring a 64.8 kWh battery sourced from CATL and a single electric motor driving the front wheels with 201 horsepower.

The PHEV takes a more traditional approach with its naturally aspirated 1.6-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and a single parallel electric motor, working together to produce a combined 180 horsepower. The electric motor sources power from a compact 11.1 kWh battery, producing 83 horsepower when operating independently.

Performance Specifications

Powertrain 1.6-liter Four-Cylinder And One Permanent-Magnet Motor Horsepower 180 HP @ 5,700 RPM Torque 195 LB-FT @ 4,000 RPM Transmission Six-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic Battery 11.1 kWh Range 510 Miles (33 EV Miles) Fuel Economy 108 MPG 0-60 MPH 7.3 Seconds Top Speed 100 MPH

(Data sourced from Kia and the EPA)

The ICE produces 104 horsepower and drives the front wheels using a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Performance-wise, the model obviously doesn't fare very well. Kia claims its PHEV sprints from 0-60 MPH in 7.3 seconds, but real-world tests suggest you'll have to wait up to 8.2 seconds to get up to this speed from a standstill. Kia locks the top speed at 100 MPH.

The Kia Niro PHEV Takes Eight Hours To Charge

The PHEV earns a 113 MPGe combined energy consumption estimate from the EPA, as well as a reasonable 33-mile range claim when the EV system commands full driving function. The smaller 11.1 kWh battery, operating at 360 volts, takes eight hours when using a household plug and three hours via Level Two charging. The system does not accommodate DC fast charging.

Range And Charging Time

Battery 11.1 kWh Range 33 miles Level 1 AC 120V Charging time (0-100%) 8 hours Level 2 AC 240V Charging time (0-100%) 3 hours Level 3 DC 450V Charging time (10-80%) N/A

(Specifications sourced from Kia)

The EPA estimates you'll spend around $4,750 on fuel over five years of piloting the Niro PHEV. Real-world consumption tests reveal that the model runs out of battery after 25 miles with an 83 MPGe energy consumption figure when consistently driving at 75 MPH.

The Kia Niro EV's Battery Costs $4.66 To Recharge

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor And Statistics, the national cost of electricity currently sits at around 17 cents per kWh. St. Louis and Seattle benefit from the lowest energy costs, at roughly 13 cents per kWh. San Diego and San Francisco are where things get a bit costly, where energy can run you you up to 42 cents for every kWh. These rates are slightly lower during off-peak hours, which are typically between 11 PM and 6 AM when most people charge.

Charging Costs

Battery 11.1 kWh Low Rate States $1.44 High Rate States $4.66 National Average $11.02

(Pricing sourced from the U.S. Bureau Of Labor And Statistics)

The Kia Niro PHEV's smaller battery means that you won't be spending a lot of money to replenish energy, regardless of where you reside. In low-rate states, the 11.1 kWh battery costs just $1.44 to recharge, while more expensive cities will return a higher but still competitive $4.66 fee.

On average, you can expect to be paying $1.88 across the country. The fully electric model costs $8.42 in cheaper regions and $27.22 in cities with the highest energy costs. The national average charging cost of its battery sits at $11.02.

Related 10 Things You Need To Know About The Kia Niro Hybrid The Kia Niro Hybrid is the perfect blend of efficiency and sustainability, all wrapped up in a sleek and stylish package.

The Kia Niro PHEV Costs $34,390

Kia offers the Niro PHEV in two trims. The base EX costs $34,390, while the flagship SX Touring increases the price to $40,410. This reflects a big price difference, but the specification levels are miles apart.

Kia has equipped the EX trim with some impressive comfort features, including a pair of 10-way electrically adjustable and heated front seats with SynTex and cloth upholstery. It also features ambient lighting, a six-speaker audio system for the 4.3-inch touchscreen, and a wireless smartphone charger.

Kia makes the SX Touring a more comprehensive setting by adding ventilation and full perforated SynTex upholstery to the front seats. You also get a seven-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system, LED interior lighting, alloy interior trimmings and pedals, and an electronically controllable sunroof.

Kia's Household Wallbox Costs $799

The Niro PHEV ships standard with a 120-volt charging cable for household plugs, but it does not offer a Level Two-rated cable. You'll have to buy this from a third-party supplier for about $200. There's a broad catalog of household wallboxes that Kia provides via reputable third-party suppliers.

These boxes range from under 8 kW to 11.5 kW, with prices starting at $799. You also need to consider the installation cost, which varies between $800 and $2,000, depending on your location.

If you're looking to make full use of the Niro PHEV's electrical system, we recommend that you invest in a Level Two household wallbox charger, as this drastically reduces the battery's charging times. The Niro EV's electrical system benefits from a convenient vehicle-to-load system.

You can use 80 percent of the battery's charge to power small appliances at 120 volts, making it a handy portable workstation or camper. Unfortunately, this isn't available for the PHEV, because of its limited battery capacity and power output.

Kia Covers The Niro PHEV's Battery For 10 Years

Kia covers all Niro PHEV battery and powertrain-related problems via its comprehensive 10-year or 100,000-mile warranty. The carmaker assures that its battery technology won't degrade by more than 30 percent during this time. If it does, it will install a new battery at its own cost.

Kia is fairly new to the electric car sphere, so we can't say how reputable its battery technology is over a long period. Kia recalled previous-generation Niro PHEVs for a leaking transmission fluid that could result in a fire, but this has no bearing on the electrical system's dependability.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare disorder in which skeletal muscles are overstimulated and unable to relax. Sudden onset can be triggered by volatile anesthetics and the muscle relaxant succinylcholine, or occasionally by stresses such as vigorous exercise or heat. Malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening because it causes a rapid rise in body temperature and/or metabolic acidosis.

Agilus is a hybrid medicine of muscle relaxant dantrolene sodium (Dantrolen IV 20 mg), which has been authorized in the European Union since 1984. It works by binding to the ryanodine receptor 1, preventing release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Agilus contains the same active substances as Dantrolen IV 20 mg but will be available in a 120-mg powder for solution for injection. In the formulation of Agilus, the mannitol and sodium hydroxide have been replaced with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and Macrogol 3350 to shorten the preparation time and improve ease of use.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) said studies had demonstrated that Agilus is of satisfactory quality and bioequivalence compared with the reference product Dantrolen IV 20 mg.

Agilus is indicated for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia in adults and children of all ages in combination with adequate support measures. The most common side effect is muscle weakness.

Also at its March meeting, the CHMP recommended a pediatric-use marketing authorization for Neoatricon (dopamine hydrochloride) for the treatment of hypotension in neonates, infants, and children younger than 18 years.

Dopamine hydrochloride works by stimulating adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, increasing systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in a dose ‑ dependent manner.

Neoatricon is a hybrid medicine of sterile dopamine concentrate BP 40 mg/mL, which has been authorized in the European Union since 1989. Neoatricon contains the same active substance as the reference product but is available in lower concentrations (1.5 mg/mL and 4.5 mg/mL).

The CHMP said it was satisfied by studies demonstrating that Neoatricon is of satisfactory quality. Because Neoatricon is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable, a bioequivalence study versus the reference product was not required, the CHMP stated.

The most common side effects are headache, ectopic heart beats, tachycardia, anginal pain, palpitation, hypotension, vasoconstriction, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.

Neoatricon should be prescribed by a pediatric specialist or pediatric intensive care specialists with access to appropriate monitoring facilities, the committee stressed.

Both Agilus and Neoatricon were submitted in hybrid applications. These rely in part on the results of preclinical tests and clinical trials of an already authorized reference product and in part on new data.",medscape.com,news,Medscape,,0.192156862745098,448823389,1,https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/gty_240322_malignant_hyperthermia_800x450.jpg,

INTRODUCTION

Suzuki Motor Corporation showcased the all-new Swift Concept at the Japan Mobility show in Tokyo in October 2023 and introduce it in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in April 2024 as its fourth generation global compact supermini. The all-new Swift represents an automotive advancement aimed at uplifting the driver through succession, evolution and innovation.

In addition to its stylish exterior design in a compact size of just 3,860mm long, the Swift features excellent visibility, a spacious cabin and ample luggage space. The initial development goal was to create an all new hatchback style that is undoubtedly Suzuki and with all the technology you need.

SPECIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS

Standard equipment for Motion grade is very comprehensive and includes 16-inch alloy wheels, LED headlamps, navigation, rear view camera, rear parking sensors, Adaptive Cruise Control, wireless smartphone link display audio, keyless entry & start, Driver Monitoring System, Dual Sensor Brake Support (upgraded), Lane Departure Warning and Weaving Alert, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and enhanced Traffic Sign Recognition.

Ultra grade adds 16-inch polished alloy wheels, automatic air conditioning, rear passenger heater outlet and electric folding door mirrors incorporating side turn indicators.

Swift is available in eight metallic colours with a further four dual tone colours available optionally incorporating either a Black Pearl or Grey metallic roof depending on the chosen body colour.

During development of the colour choices for new Swift, particular attention and effort was given to the formulation of Frontier Blue Pearl Metallic. This new shade has a very vivid depth of colour thanks to a new three layer coating process. Burning Red Pearl Metallic is also formulated in this way.

After electroplating of the body shell from bare metal and then primed, a base colour coat is first applied followed by a clear colour coat and then finished with a further clear coat. The result is a very striking appearance that evokes a new generation of Suzuki quality.

A full equipment and technical specification list is available on the PDF version of the more detailed press pack on the Media website.

EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR DESIGN

The muscular appearance of the new Swift is further established by blacked-out pillars creating the appearance of a floating roof that adds a sense of lightness, while a high-tech look comes in the form of a piano-black front grille and L-shaped signature lamps that conform to the cars flowing body lines. The LED headlamps have been revised to an inner lens + light rod type that give them a wider appearance when illuminated.

At the rear, the car has a new and distinctive sculpted tailgate with a wide rear bumper design and an integrated rear hatch spoiler and boot side spoilers helping to give new Swift a look of balanced stability. The rear combination lamps are also of the same design type as the front and when illuminated, provide a three dimensional appearance.

Inside, a new high quality dual-tone design is featured with centre controls angled towards the driver and a prominent nine-inch infotainment display fitted as standard equipment.

The standard equipment heated front seats are of new design with reshaped cushioning between the shoulder and side bolsters creating a more sculpted look. This design is accentuated by the use of a geometric pattern on the upholstery surface and a dual tone 'Melange Grey' and black cloth is used for both Motion and Ultra grades.

Chief Engineer, Masao Kobori comments ""The Swift has always been designed to be fun to drive, and the new car is no exception. But in order to respond to peoples diversifying lifestyles, we focused not just on design and driving which have always been Swift strengths - but also on making every aspect of daily life with a Swift more exciting and satisfying. That was the concept that guided our development from the start.""

'HEARTECT' LIGHTWEIGHT PLATFORM

The new Swift rests on the established platform known as ""HEARTECT"" that delivers enhanced fundamental vehicle performance due to being both light and highly rigid. A comprehensive overhaul of the underbody's structure and component layout during development resulted in the adoption of a highly rigid frame that enhances collision safety and has a continuous, smooth and curving form to help disperse energy quicker.

Adopting Suzuki's latest generation platform strategy minimised the size of the engine compartment which has enabled maximising the space available for cabin occupants and luggage.

Reduced NVH

During development, various measures were taken to reduce noise, vibration and harshness to assist with greater ride comfort and also make the cabin environment even quieter than the outgoing model. For the first time on a Suzuki vehicle, sound and vibration adhesive has been applied to the under body to reduce transmission of noise and vibration into the cabin, particularly on bumpy roads.

Aerodynamics

The new Swift introduces a number of new aerodynamic design aspects including Suzuki's first use of a torsion beam cover for the rear axle and Swift's first tailgate side spoiler and roof end spoiler. Under body spoilers and strakes are also included and the whole body exterior is optimised for better aerodynamics. This includes a smooth front bumper assembly which is free of ornamentation and trim elements.

New design 16-inch alloy wheels offer an ideal balance of aerodynamics, weight and strength. This design makes the wheels appear larger than their actual size and the wheel cutouts are smaller with a disc shaped outer rim to assist aerodynamic performance. Additionally, latest technology tyres offer 15 per cent lower rolling resistance than those fitted on the previous model.

Z12E Engine Technology

An all-new and highly efficient three-cylinder petrol engine with multi-point fuel injection has been developed for the new Swift which offers enhanced fuel economy, improved torque and even lower CO2 emissions than before. The maximum power output is 82PS with a slightly higher torque figure of 112Nm at just 4,500rpm, acceleration time to 62mph is improved by 5% to 12.5 seconds for the manual model and 11.9 seconds for the optional CVT.

Compared with the outgoing K12D engine, higher fuel efficiency has been achieved by optimising cylinder turbulence for faster combustion, utilising an intermediate locking mechanism on the Variable Valve Timing (VVT) intake and increasing the flow rate of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve.

Hybrid Technology - Enhanced Hybrid System

Fuel efficiency is further enhanced when paired with the self-charging hybrid system powered by a lithium-ion battery with capacity of 10Ah to improve energy recovery efficiency.

Fitted as standard equipment for the new Swift, the 12V Mild Hybrid system is a compact and lightweight unit that incorporates an Integrated Starter Generator (known as ISG) which acts as both a generator and starter motor, the ISG is belt driven and assists the engine during vehicle take off and acceleration and also generates electricity through regenerative braking. The ISG unit has a power output of 2.3kW with a torque figure of 60Nm. Suzuki's 12V Mild Hybrid is particularly light weight with the components of the system adding less than 7.0kg to the overall weight of the car.

For the Swift Motion with manual transmission the Hybrid system helps reach a CO2 emissions figure of just 99g/km (WLTP regulation) plus achieve a fuel consumption figure of 64.2 mpg (WLTP) on the combined cycle.

SAFETY ENHANCEMENTS - HIGHLIGHTS

Standard Active safety equipment for both Motion and Ultra Swift grades includes an upgraded Dual Sensor Brake Support system using a millimetre-wave radar (previously lidar) combined with a monocular camera. This system has enhanced collision mitigation with improved night time and intersection visibility and with its improved functionality can detect pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and vehicles in front.

The system monitors the road ahead by means of milliwave radar. The radar technology enables it to work even at high speeds, in darkness, and in rain or other bad weather. The system prevents or mitigates a collision by means of three functions which are Warning, Brake Assist and Automatic Braking.

Driver Monitoring System (DMS)

A camera built into the instrument panel monitors the drivers eyes and a near-infrared LED illuminates the drivers face to enable monitoring in low light. If the system detects that the driver is drowsy, falling asleep, or looking away from the road, it sounds a warning alarm and displays an alert message on the information display.

The system detects driver drowsiness by monitoring the degree of eyelid closing and yawn frequencies. If this is detected at speeds of approximately 43mph or more, the monitoring system will advise the driver to take a break by sounding an alarm and displaying an alert message on the information display.

Lane Departure Warning / Lane Departure Prevention Function:

When the vehicle is travelling at vehicle speeds of approximately 37mph or above and is departing the lane without the driver using a turn signal, the system vibrates the steering wheel and lights a warning indicator in the instrument cluster to draw attention to lane departures caused by factors such as inattention to the road. Under these conditions, the driver will also notice an automatic input from the steering wheel to ensure the car remains in its correct direction of travel.

DRIVER COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE

Suzuki Connect

First introduced on the S-Cross Hybrid model in 2022, Suzuki has now introduced Suzuki Connect*1 in the UK and European markets for the new Swift.

Suzuki Connect utilises the vehicle's data communication module (DCM) to connect users to their vehicles in real time, enabling users to take advantage of convenient functions via the Suzuki Connect smartphone app*2.

By connecting the vehicle via the Suzuki Connect app, available on Android and iOS, users can access a wide range of convenient connected services, including the ability to monitor and receive notifications about the status of their vehicle in real time, remotely lock and unlock the vehicle, and view information such as driving history and the location of their parked car.

Users can also choose to receive maintenance-related information and warning light notifications via the Suzuki Connect app, and if an issue is detected, vital diagnostic information can be seamlessly shared with their registered Suzuki dealer, allowing for faster and more comprehensive after-sales support.

9-inch Display Audio System with Navigation and Smartphone Connectivity

The audio system for both Motion and Ultra grades has a full colour 9-inch High Definition display that includes the audio control, standard equipment navigation system, rear view camera image and connectivity for both Apple CarPlay and Android devices via USB and WI-Fi.

Apple CarPlay is the smarter and safer way to use an iPhone in the Swift. Apart from making calls it also facilitates receiving directions for optimised traffic conditions, listening to music, accessing email, text messages and more. Android Auto device users can also enable Google Assistant voice commands to access a wide variety of supported apps.

Service Activated Warranty - Up to Seven Years Cover.

Low cost of ownership is ensured with the inclusion of Service Activated Warranty to all Suzuki customers. Introduced in April 2023, Service Activated Warranty is offered free of charge once the car reaches the end of its manufacturer warranty period and is then booked in for its next scheduled service within the Suzuki Dealer network. This warranty stays in place until the next qualifying service and is then simply renewed again up to a maximum vehicle age of 7 years / 100,000 miles - whichever comes first.

As an enhancement to Suzuki's well renowned product reliability record, Service Activated Warranty offers 'Peace of Mind as Standard' as well as strong customer retention within its network of new car dealers and authorised repair centres.

Major components are covered, and should a customer decide to sell their car between services and within the seven-year qualifying period, the warranty can simply be transferred to the next owner - again free of charge.

Additionally, Service Activated Warranty can also be applied to a qualifying Suzuki that has been purchased privately or has a gap in its dealer service history providing it goes through a Suzuki Vehicle Health Check in the first instance.",carsite.co.za,news,carsite.co.za,Breyten Odendaal,0.4666666666666666,448822902,1,https://carsite.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-new-swift-hybrid-suzukis-fourth-generation-compact-supermini-scaled.jpg,

The manager of the CEEC, Francesc Ribera, was in charge of kicking off the day, which served as a ""meeting point"" for the sector and which had the will to continue promoting photovoltaics ""despite the uncertainties "". While reviewing the program of the event, Ribera highlighted the ""collaboration"" to boost the energy market and the importance of land parks ""which must be a driving force for a more sustainable future"".

Next, it was the turn of the director of Energy, Daniel Pérez, with a presentation in which he analyzed the precedents of the sector, with the ""perfect storm"" that caused the crisis in energy prices year 2022, and referred to some of the actions needed to meet the challenge of decarbonisation. Pérez has pointed out the reduction of energy consumption, electrification, the implementation of more renewables, storage and demand management as the main actions to carry out to keep moving forward.

With reference to the need to grow in renewables, Pérez wanted to make it clear that it is not a problem of available surface, giving as an example the reduction of 97 thousand hectares of cultivation that occurred between 2001 and 2009 in Catalonia. ""Photovoltaic only needs 90,000"", he replied. In this sense, Pérez also referred to the positive impact that a greater presence of renewables in the territory would have ""to attract industry"". ""Neither H2med, nor electrical interconnection with France, what is needed is to electrify the ports and become an exporting power, exporting industrial products"", he affirmed, while also pointing out the need to solve the ""pending subject"" of electrification rail transport.

Once the presentation was finished, the debate tables began, the first of which was about self-consumption. In it, the director of the Barcelona Energy Agency, Cristina Castells, took part as speakers; the Director of Infrastructure and Energy of Mercabarna, Marc Vilà; ENGIE's head of Distributed Solar, Storage and Green Mobility, Maria Colom; and the head of the ICAEN Renewable Energies Area, Francesc Vidal.

The speakers have agreed to point out the slowness of permitting or processing as one of the major barriers to self-consumption in Catalonia. Colom gave as an example a 10 MW project that his company presented in 2022 and which is still pending approval. ""It's a long time. The administration should speed up the process"", he commented. To this fact is added the drop in the price of energy, which also worries the promoters due to the drop in the profitability of the projects it is causing. ""The price is going down a bit and so is the appeal. It remains competitive but it will cost us more"", commented Vilà, who reported on the Repower Mercabarna project to promote self-generation in its facilities.

The second round table focused on collective self-consumption and energy communities. Moderated by the CEO of KM0 Energy, Santi Martínez, the debate had the participation of the engineer in the New Generation Projects team of Som Energia, Carles Adell; the third deputy mayor of Caldes de Montbui City Council, Jordi Martín; the CEO of Adymus Energy, Rafael Ruiz, and Greenpeace's Head of Self-Consumption and Energy Communities, Maria Prado.

In this table, the processing has once again been one of the main topics on the part of the speakers, due to the slowness in the implementation of the projects. In this regard, the head of the Caldes Montbui town hall, which has the largest energy community in Catalonia to date, has regretted not having been ""more ambitious"" with the amount of installed power requested, taking into account the that it took to get it up and running. For his part, Prado has denounced the obstacles of the distributors to connect the energy communities to the network, and he wanted to highlight the role of the local energy agencies in Catalonia in mediation and support, which for many is still ""one of the main barriers"".

Finally, the last round table, moderated by the lawyer specialized in energy, Jorge Andrey, was dedicated to photovoltaic parks on land. The head of the Electrical Installations Authorization Service, Míriam Ripoll, took part as speakers; the director of Energy of Sorigué, Ignasi Clariana; the Director General of Sunowatt - UNEF, Salvador Salat; and Maria Crehuet of the Association of Microtowns of Catalonia.

Ripoll began by talking about the data on the implementation of this type of parks, taking as a temporary reference the Decree-Law to accelerate the deployment of renewable energies of 2021. ""We came from a paralysis: before the Decree-Law we had 93 MW in solar and now we already have 1700 MW authorized"", he said, adding that almost 3900 MW are in the process. Despite these data, the rest of the speakers have been critical of the pace of implementation of the parks to reach the set objectives as well as the delay in their processing. Clariana has attributed it to the ""lack of leadership"" and the ""lack of capacity of the administration"", while Salat has gone further pointing out ""the political structure"". For his part, Creheut has questioned whether a context like the current one, where the need to speed up large renewable projects prevails, is good for the environmental and social balance.

To close the day, the coordinator of the Photovoltaic Working Group, Alberto Barriga, intervened to make a summary of the event, providing some of the conclusions, and encouraging participation in the group. ""We will continue to push because we believe in the potential for change in photovoltaics both in the industrial and environmental spheres"", he said.",clustercollaboration.eu,news,clustercollaboration.eu,,0.4745098039215687,448820096,1,,

SAPMF has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Fincantieri S.p.A to assess potential collaboration opportunities in the field of autonomous subsea vehicles and their integration with surface and underwater units.

The agreement, signed at Palazzo Marina in Rome, is aimed at enabling both companies to participate in major programs in the domain of surveillance and control of critical underwater infrastructure and rescue operations, in Italian and international markets. To engage in these programs, the collaboration will leverage the specific complementary technologies offered by both companies.

The partnership involves the integration of Fincantieri's surface vessels and submarines with Saipem's drone development program ""Hydrone"". The resident Hydrone Autonomous Underwater Vehicle was developed by Sonsub, Saipem's subsea technologies subsidiary.

Saipem has highlighted that it is the first company to have qualified and commercialized resident autonomous subsea drones, globally. The autonomous subsea drones were developed by Saipem for intervention and inspection activities up to a depth of 3,000 meters.

Fincantieri has positioned itself at the center of development programs in the Underwater sector. The company offers extremely promising business opportunities due to its ability to effectively integrate the defense and civil industries. It has constructed a total of 180 submarines since 1929, out of which 105 were built at the Muggiano shipyard.

Saipem is a leading player in the oilfield services industry, based in Italy. It specializes in the engineering and construction of major projects, both offshore and onshore.

Fincantieri is a shipbuilding company based in Italy. It is one of the largest shipbuilding groups globally.

Friday, March 22, 2024 | 8:30 a.m.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least five people, officials said Friday.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the more than two-year-long war, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the national utility Ukrenergo.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he told The Associated Press. He said the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, suffered the most damage.

Last winter, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

Russian officials refer to the conflict as a ""special military operation,"" eschewing the word ""war."" But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attracted attention on Friday by telling a Russian newspaper that ""when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.""

He later told reporters in a conference call that ''This is not connected with any kind of juridical change. It is de jure an SVO,"" the Russian acronym for special military operation.

Both Peskov and President Vladimir Putin have occasionally used the word ""war"" about the fighting in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the more than two-year-long war, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the national utility Ukrenergo.

Jack Evans finds out.

Toyota's original C-HR was a car which arrived with a bold new style that added some much-needed life into what was a reasonably drab line-up of cars. But how do you go about replacing a model which made such an impact? That's the challenge facing Toyota with the introduction of the new C-HR.

But Toyota certainly hasn't been tempted to go down the subtle route as the C-HR arrives with a striking new look alongside an efficient hybrid setup which is so required by fuel-conscious buyers. We've been driving it to see what it's like.

Since its introduction, more than 850,000 C-HRs have been produced, so Toyota can't rock the boat too much with this new model. It's why we've got a focus on space, plenty of robust materials that can cope with family life and a usable amount of boot room that ensures that this model can handle the day-in, day-out challenges.

As well as this standard hybrid model, there's a plug-in hybrid version which can deliver up to 41 miles of electric-only range. It costs more - coming in at a hefty £42,610 over the standard car's £31,290 starting price - but could be a smart option for drivers who have access to regular home charging. A plug-in point will be required to make it as efficient as possible.

But back to this 'regular' hybrid, we've got a 1.8-litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor for a combined output of 138bhp. Toyota claims a 0-60mph time of ten seconds, while flat-out it'll manage 106mph. While these performance stats are hardly hair-raising, they're on par for the segment and do flag up the C-HR's real focus - efficiency.

Because with a combined fuel economy figure of 60.1mpg, this small Toyota is remarkably good on fuel. It just misses out on the magical under-100g/km mark, too, with the C-HR's CO2 figures standing at a still-respectable 105g/km. It's all accompanied by Toyota's great history of producing reliable cars

It feels as though the C-HR has been designed to be as silky-smooth as possible. It's a very quiet car - even at motorway speeds - and when coupled with the electric-only running you get at slower paces, it all makes for a very relaxing driving experience. The ride is a touch firm, however.

You do need to drive it in a more sedate manner to get the best from it. This isn't a car which likes to be driven harshly; the CVT automatic gearbox, as it does in other cars, complains noisily under heavy applications of throttle and makes pushing on a bit unpleasant. However, drive in a calmer, more considered fashion and the gearbox makes sense - it's almost like a little reminder to drive more efficiently.

The C-HR is anything but boring with its angular, futuristic appearance helping it to make quite the impression wherever it goes. It's available in a number of striking colour combinations, but it's the black flash at the rear of the car which makes the biggest statement. Will it date quickly? Only time will tell. But in the here and now, we think the C-HR looks pretty good indeed.

Fortunately, all grades of C-HR bar the very entry-level specification get a statement bi-tone roof - so there's no need to spend too much more money in order to get it - though you'll have to go to the upper reaches of the trim list in order to secure that striking gloss black rear section. Our car, in GR Sport trim, gets plenty of go-faster touches inspired by Toyota's performance vehicles, including massive 20-inch alloy wheels which, in fairness, are probably behind the sharpness of our test car's ride.

The interior of the C-HR isn't quite as quirky as its exterior, but that's no bad thing. There are plenty of physical controls which make changing certain aspects much easier on the move, but it'd be nice if there was a better level of distinction between these buttons - the whole panel is very much the same colour and we feel that even if you had red and blue for the temperature, it could make things easier still.

Build quality is good overall, with some harsher plastics found lower down. It feels a bit step up when you compare it to its predecessor, however, while the 388-litre boot is a handy size. It's a bit of a shame the rear seats don't fold down completely flat, mind.

Prices for the C-HR kick off from £31,290 and at that entry-level 'Icon' grade, you're getting 17-inch alloy wheels, an eight-inch infotainment screen with Apple CarPlay as standard and automatic air conditioning. However, with only flat white paint and black upholstery coming without extra cost, there's a chance that this version could end up looking a little plain.

Step up to Design grade - priced from £34,865 - and those wheels step up to 18-inch machined versions, while inside there's a larger 12.3-inch infotainment system which elevates the in-car experience. It's also at this specification where the plug-in hybrid setup becomes available - you can't get it on the entry-level version. Design is the specification we'd be tempted to opt for, as it brings a good level of equipment without spiking the price too high.

The Toyota C-HR is a fine replacement for what was a very successful car. However, where this car has been radically improved is inside, as it feels far more premium and well-made than before. In its higher trim levels, the C-HR can start to feel a bit expensive, but opt for a cheaper version and, coupled with its efficient powertrain, this can be a good-value option.

The plug-in hybrid would be a good choice for drivers who can charge up at home, but given the efficiency of this regular hybrid version, you'll still get plenty of fuel savings when picking this 'standard' C-HR.",irishnews.com,news,The Irish News,,0.2392156862745098,448817553,1,https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/WQZ2MXQ4EBLCBHLFLO6PXT7CDM.jpg?smart=true&auth=1ece74ef88e6b5e05dda246ac98160a94f7ace3fe063363149a9316f7b36a9bb&width=1200&height=630,

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday unanimously affirmed last year's interconnection reform rule, Order 2023, to address what Chairman Willie Phillips called an ""unacceptable backlog"" of generators waiting to connect to the grid.

Commissioner Mark Christie warned, however, that queue reform is ""not a silver bullet"" as fossil fuel plant retirements accelerate and get replaced by resources without the same reliability attributes.

There were 1,350 GW of generation and 680 GW of storage projects in interconnection queues around the country at the end of 2022, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory concluded in a report last year. Most of the projects are solar, wind and storage. Constructed projects took, on average, five years from interconnection request to commercial operations.

FERC's July 2023 order required a ""first-ready, first-served"" cluster study approach and made other reforms to speed up the processing of interconnection backlogs, including requiring regional transmission organizations to consider the use of grid-enhancing technologies and hybrid resources. The rule also set deadlines for RTOs and other transmission providers to complete interconnection studies, and it imposed penalties if the deadlines are missed.

The order approved Thursday addressed rehearing and clarification requests, as well as the initial set of compliance orders associated with it.

""We largely uphold requirements in the final rule but make various clarifications,"" Phillips said. ""We uphold the removal of the reasonable effort standard and affirm the commission's authority to adopt late study penalties. ... We also remove a potential hurdle to interconnection by broadening the acceptable forms of security for deposits.""

The decision ""sends a strong message that the commission is committed to implementing meaningful interconnection reforms that promote fairness and accountability,"" Melissa Alfano, senior director of energy markets and counsel for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement. ""These new rules will establish clear expectations for all parties involved in the interconnection process and outline consequences for inaction.""

The commission's order also affirms that transmission providers ""have the sole discretion in determining whether to use"" an alternative transmission technology or grid-enhancing technology, Christie noted in a concurring statement.

Commissioner Allison Clements said the commission's order requires ""greater stringency"" on both project developers and transmission providers, which she said is ""an appropriate approach"" given pervasive interconnection backlogs.

""Electric demand is surging, driven by domestic manufacturing, the demand for data storage and processing power and the growth of artificial intelligence. Getting new generation online quickly is imperative,"" Clements said.

The commissioners also received a staff report on U.S. energy markets in 2023. The report concluded that markets ""remained responsive to fundamentals of supply and demand, with market forces driving infrastructure investment and commodity prices.""

Christie responded to the report by referencing recent wholesale market studies -- in particular, one published last week by the PJM Interconnection independent market monitor, which concluded that up to 30% of PJM's installed capacity is at risk of retiring by 2030 without clear sources of replacement.

Interconnection queue reform ""is not going to fix it because the queue is largely non-dispatchable resources that are simply not one-for-one replacements,"" he said. ""So this is a huge issue, a huge problem, and needs to be addressed.""

Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Phillips agreed that no single action will fix energy grid issues. ""But I can also tell you, there is no greater action that the commission can take that can address reliability, affordability and sustainability than addressing transmission reform in general,"" he said. And FERC's affirmation of Order 2023 ""is a good step in that transmission reform journey. Now we have more work to do.""

FERC is working on transmission siting issues more broadly and is expected to issue an order in the near future.",utilitydive.com,news,Utility Dive,Robert Walton,-0.04313725490196074,448817383,1,https://www.utilitydive.com/imgproxy/MepZBVH-pUq1B3nQqKFw67Nr8t4jRzCuDF6CQLnD9lk/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL1AxMDEwMzIxLmpwZw.webp,

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the biggest electric power station of its kind in Ukraine, stopped functioning following Russia's missile strike on Friday.

Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise that manages many major hydroelectric power plants along the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, told local broadcasters that the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station has been severely damaged.

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, also known as the Dnipro Dam, is located in the city of Zaporizhzhia and is made up of two units, but none of them are working, Syrota said.

""We can't even get to all of the damaged areas to inspect. Today, it is difficult to figure out how long it will take to make it operational,"" he said.

The power cut from the damaged Dnieper Hydroelectric Station may cause an energy shortage in many Ukrainian regions.

Earlier in the day, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said Russia had launched its largest attack on the country's energy system since the beginning of the year.

The minister said in a statement that power generation facilities, as well as electricity, lines, and energy distribution systems, were hit in several of Ukraine's regions.

""The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, as last year, to cause a large-scale malfunction of the country's energy system. ... There are power outages in some regions of Ukraine,"" he said.

Glushchenko noted that one of the power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was de-energized during the shelling.

The management of the plant confirmed the shutdown of one of the two operating high-voltage lines, noting that there was no threat to the safety of the nuclear facility.

The Ukrainian authorities reported a series of explosions across Ukraine earlier Friday morning, and the air raid alert sounded in all regions.

The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed it carried out a massive air strike on Ukraine's energy facilities, saying it was retaliation for attacks on Russia's border regions.

According to the ministry, the goal of the strike was to disable enterprises, producing and repairing military equipment and ammunition, as well as to destroy stocks of weapons delivered from NATO countries.

""From March 16 to 22, the armed forces of the Russian Federation, in response to the shelling of Russian territory, carried out a total of 49 retaliatory strikes with missiles, including Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missiles, and drones. Their targets included decision-making centers, airfields, production facilities, and warehouses,"" it said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the more than two-year-long war, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the national utility Ukrenergo.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he told The Associated Press. He said the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, suffered the most damage.

Last winter, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

Russian officials refer to the conflict as a ""special military operation,"" eschewing the word ""war."" But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attracted attention on Friday by telling a Russian newspaper that ""when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.""

He later told reporters in a conference call that ''This is not connected with any kind of juridical change. It is de jure an SVO,"" the Russian acronym for special military operation.

WHO doesn't love a barbecue in summer, but when it comes to choosing the best barbecue grill where do you start?

Charcoal gives that traditional BBQ taste, but lighting the coals when it's windy can be a bit of a nightmare, whereas with gas you don't have that weather problem, but you also don't get the chargrilled flavour.

So how about a mixture of the two?

A hybrid barbecue offers the best of both worlds - the ease of gas with the authenticity of charcoal - and you can now have it at an affordable price.

I tested the Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 to find out what it could do, whether it was worth the extra cost and most importantly, how well it cooks.

Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0, £314

American brand Char-Broil was one of the first companies to make charcoal barbecue grills for the home cook.

It's got a strong reputation for making mid-range barbecues that have premium features, but without the hefty price tag that often comes with high-end grills.

The Char-Broil Gas2Coal is a design the brand first unveiled in 2016, with the barbecue equipped for both gas and charcoal cooking.

The idea is that you use gas to start the coals, or just use gas on its own - thanks to the built-in gas ignition, it means you never have to fiddle with matches or lighters again.

READ MORE:

Char-Broil released Gas2Coal 2.0 in 2021 with a couple of design updates.

Staying put are their stainless steel burners, the porcelain-enamelled cast-iron grates, the patented stainless steel charcoal tray and the SureFire electronic ignition system.

As part of the design update, the company introduced a gas bottle gauge and a storage space where a gas bottle of up to 6kg can be secured into place even when you move the barbecue.

There's also easier access to the gauge so you can see exactly how much gas is left.

And to make switching between gas and charcoal even easier, a grate lifter is supplied.

I tested the two-burner grill, which is the smallest in the Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 range. It measures 116.8cm (H) x 114cm (W) x 62.9cm (L), with a cooking area of 47.8cm x 44.5cm.

If you're used to basic charcoal grills, this one is a little bit more involved.

The assembly can take a couple of hours depending on how quick you are, although the instructions are very clear and you only need a screwdriver. Plus, you only have to do this once.

The two-burner barbecue features two sturdy shelves, one on either side of the cooking surface, where you can rest any food and tools - on bigger models, one of the shelves is replaced with a standalone gas burner.

The main cooking area is a decent size, with enough room to cook for around six to 10 people at the same time, depending on what you're grilling.

Just above it is a warming shelf where you can rest any cooked food and you can lower the lid to cover everything, even when the warming shelf is loaded.

When it comes to fuel, you can use it as a gas-only barbecue; a propane regulator and hose are included in the set-up, but the grill will work with butane, propane or a mix of the two.

To use it as a charcoal grill, you simply line up your briquettes on the charcoal tray and then turn the gas on high for 15 minutes with the lid down to get the coals burning.

After that, you can switch off the gas and let the coals do their work. You'll find full instructions in the user manual.

I found the Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 super easy to use and I was really impressed by the results.

By having the lid down, the grill reached much higher temperatures very quickly - there's a temperature gauge in the lid to tell you exactly how hot it is inside. This means food cooks quickly and stays juicy, with absolutely no burnt bits.

The lighting process also meant that even on windy days you could get your barbecue going. The lid will act as a wind blocker when you're cooking and the wheels make it easy to manoeuvre into position.

I particularly liked the porcelain-enamelled grill plates, which produced restaurant-style grill marks that looked impressive.

The warming shelf and the shelves on either side of the grill were useful and made the whole operation much slicker.

There were a couple of downsides though.

If you don't want to use the gas component, or you've simply run out of gas, you'll need a chimney starter to get your barbecue going. The layout of the charcoal tray means you can only have one layer of coals and you can't build a mound or use any firelighters.

And if you're cooking for a large group, you can't just add more coals - you'd effectively have to start again or switch to gas.

Absolutely no one enjoys cleaning a barbecue the day after and, because of its setup, the Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 does have more components to clean than your basic charcoal barbecue.

That said, it's no more than other barbecues of the same size.

I left the removable bits to soak overnight, which meant there was minimal scrubbing involved the following morning.

You do need to wipe down the lid and the interiors as well though, and if you've used the warming tray, check for any run-off down the back.

I recommend having a good spray on cleaner that can help shift some of the grease if you've had a particularly heavy grilling session.

Having always cooked on basic charcoal grills that cost a fraction of the price, I wasn't sure this one could deliver results worthy of the extra expense. However, the Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 surpassed my expectations.

It combines the best features of gas and charcoal barbecues - easy to start and great flavour - into one machine and you can use either fuel, depending on what you fancy.

The porcelain-enamelled, cast-iron grill also produces superb results without burning your food.

I think it's a great option if you're looking for a premium quality product without the hefty price tag.

The Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 is available from many retailers. I found it at Amazon but you can also buy the barbecue at:

You can also check on the Char-Broil website for stockists near you.

If you're after a larger version of the Gas2Coal then Char-Broil offers several alternatives. The next size up is the 330 model, which has three main burners and a side burner, which is great for steaming or sauteing vegetables. Larger still is the 440 version, which has four main burners and two charcoal trays, or the Special Edition 4, which also boasts a ceramic sear burner and an extra griddle.

Hybrid grills are available from other barbecue manufacturers, such as Outback and Grillstream - both of these brands sell a selection of barbecues that are fuelled by gas and charcoal, in a range of different sizes and designs.

Jack Evans finds out.

>

Toyota's original C-HR was a car which arrived with a bold new style that added some much-needed life into what was a reasonably drab line-up of cars. But how do you go about replacing a model which made such an impact? That's the challenge facing Toyota with the introduction of the new C-HR.

But Toyota certainly hasn't been tempted to go down the subtle route as the C-HR arrives with a striking new look alongside an efficient hybrid setup which is so required by fuel-conscious buyers. We've been driving it to see what it's like.

>

Since its introduction, more than 850,000 C-HRs have been produced, so Toyota can't rock the boat too much with this new model. It's why we've got a focus on space, plenty of robust materials that can cope with family life and a usable amount of boot room that ensures that this model can handle the day-in, day-out challenges.

As well as this standard hybrid model, there's a plug-in hybrid version which can deliver up to 41 miles of electric-only range. It costs more - coming in at a hefty £42,610 over the standard car's £31,290 starting price - but could be a smart option for drivers who have access to regular home charging. A plug-in point will be required to make it as efficient as possible.

>

But back to this 'regular' hybrid, we've got a 1.8-litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor for a combined output of 138bhp. Toyota claims a 0-60mph time of ten seconds, while flat-out it'll manage 106mph. While these performance stats are hardly hair-raising, they're on par for the segment and do flag up the C-HR's real focus - efficiency.

Because with a combined fuel economy figure of 60.1mpg, this small Toyota is remarkably good on fuel. It just misses out on the magical under-100g/km mark, too, with the C-HR's CO2 figures standing at a still-respectable 105g/km. It's all accompanied by Toyota's great history of producing reliable cars

>

It feels as though the C-HR has been designed to be as silky-smooth as possible. It's a very quiet car - even at motorway speeds - and when coupled with the electric-only running you get at slower paces, it all makes for a very relaxing driving experience. The ride is a touch firm, however.

You do need to drive it in a more sedate manner to get the best from it. This isn't a car which likes to be driven harshly; the CVT automatic gearbox, as it does in other cars, complains noisily under heavy applications of throttle and makes pushing on a bit unpleasant. However, drive in a calmer, more considered fashion and the gearbox makes sense - it's almost like a little reminder to drive more efficiently.

>

The C-HR is anything but boring with its angular, futuristic appearance helping it to make quite the impression wherever it goes. It's available in a number of striking colour combinations, but it's the black flash at the rear of the car which makes the biggest statement. Will it date quickly? Only time will tell. But in the here and now, we think the C-HR looks pretty good indeed.

Fortunately, all grades of C-HR bar the very entry-level specification get a statement bi-tone roof - so there's no need to spend too much more money in order to get it - though you'll have to go to the upper reaches of the trim list in order to secure that striking gloss black rear section. Our car, in GR Sport trim, gets plenty of go-faster touches inspired by Toyota's performance vehicles, including massive 20-inch alloy wheels which, in fairness, are probably behind the sharpness of our test car's ride.

>

The interior of the C-HR isn't quite as quirky as its exterior, but that's no bad thing. There are plenty of physical controls which make changing certain aspects much easier on the move, but it'd be nice if there was a better level of distinction between these buttons - the whole panel is very much the same colour and we feel that even if you had red and blue for the temperature, it could make things easier still.

Build quality is good overall, with some harsher plastics found lower down. It feels a bit step up when you compare it to its predecessor, however, while the 388-litre boot is a handy size. It's a bit of a shame the rear seats don't fold down completely flat, mind.

>

Prices for the C-HR kick off from £31,290 and at that entry-level 'Icon' grade, you're getting 17-inch alloy wheels, an eight-inch infotainment screen with Apple CarPlay as standard and automatic air conditioning. However, with only flat white paint and black upholstery coming without extra cost, there's a chance that this version could end up looking a little plain.

Step up to Design grade - priced from £34,865 - and those wheels step up to 18-inch machined versions, while inside there's a larger 12.3-inch infotainment system which elevates the in-car experience. It's also at this specification where the plug-in hybrid setup becomes available - you can't get it on the entry-level version. Design is the specification we'd be tempted to opt for, as it brings a good level of equipment without spiking the price too high.

The Toyota C-HR is a fine replacement for what was a very successful car. However, where this car has been radically improved is inside, as it feels far more premium and well-made than before. In its higher trim levels, the C-HR can start to feel a bit expensive, but opt for a cheaper version and, coupled with its efficient powertrain, this can be a good-value option.

The plug-in hybrid would be a good choice for drivers who can charge up at home, but given the efficiency of this regular hybrid version, you'll still get plenty of fuel savings when picking this 'standard' C-HR.",shropshirestar.com,news,Shropshire Star,,0.2392156862745098,448816864,1,https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/YLDmeyIU3ojc6znc2PLH9_rY7b0=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/7VE3NAG445HSND5KQURFA7553I.jpg,

A major leakage of petroleum products into the Dnipro River has occurred following the missile strikes on the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Station (DniproGES) on Friday, March 22. The State Ecological Inspection of Ukraine has reported the contamination, which has also affected the nearby soil.

The impact on DniproGES resulted in soil pollution and the release of petroleum products into the water, specifically in the city of Dnipro. Inspectors have collected water samples for laboratory analysis to assess the extent of the pollution.

Furthermore, the missile strike caused a fire at the power station, although it has now been successfully localized. However, smoke still persists in the engine room, preventing specialists from entering and assessing the situation.

This incident follows Russia's targeted strikes on Ukrainian energy system targets, leaving numerous regions without electricity. Ukraine's largest hydroelectric power station, DniproGES, was forced to cease operations due to the attack. The State Duma has labeled this night attack as revenge for the shelling of the Belgorod region and other Russian areas.

This article delves into the groundbreaking integration of AI with SAP ABAP programming, exploring how this fusion is revolutionizing SAP development processes.

SAP ABAP has long been the backbone of SAP development, providing a powerful and versatile language for customizing SAP applications. ABAP's capabilities have driven the customization of SAP systems to meet specific business requirements.

Traditional SAP development in ABAP involves manual coding, testing, and debugging processes. As business complexities increase, this traditional approach faces challenges in terms of speed, efficiency, and adaptability to dynamic market demands.

AI integration in SAP ABAP programming introduces automation to development processes. AI algorithms can analyze patterns in existing code, identify common errors, and even propose optimized solutions, reducing manual coding efforts and minimizing the risk of bugs.

AI-driven tools can assess code quality, adherence to best practices, and compliance with coding standards. This ensures that the developed applications not only meet functional requirements but also align with industry standards, leading to more robust and maintainable codebases.

Now, I asked the AI tool to write a simple program to extract data from MARA, and no doubt it produced nice code.

To test more I asked it to write a program to extract data by combining two tables -- mara (material master data) and marc (material master company code) -- and it produced the code below. There is no doubt that this is very good code.

But when I asked the AI to write an extract data from the MSGEG table with multiple conditions query, which is a bit complex, the prompt I gave to the AI was: ""ABAP program to extract data from mseg table where mblnr in 10 to 100 and mjahr in 2022 to 2024 and bwart eq 1234 and werks Eq 1234"". I received the code below which is not good.

Integrating AI with SAP ABAP introduces intelligent code assistants. These assistants can provide real-time suggestions, auto-completion, and context-aware recommendations as developers write code, streamlining the coding process and improving overall developer productivity.

AI can predict potential issues in the code during the development phase, enabling developers to proactively address issues before they escalate. This predictive debugging capability saves time, enhances code reliability, and facilitates a smoother development lifecycle.

The fusion of AI with SAP ABAP accelerates innovation by facilitating rapid prototyping. Developers can leverage AI tools to quickly build and test prototypes, enabling organizations to experiment with new functionalities and features before full-scale implementation.

AI-infused SAP ABAP programming enables organizations to respond more rapidly to changing business requirements. Developers can adapt and customize applications swiftly, ensuring that SAP systems remain agile and aligned with evolving business needs.

The integration of AI with SAP ABAP necessitates skill upgradation among development teams. Organizations need to invest in training programs to equip their developers with the knowledge and expertise required to leverage AI tools effectively.

As AI becomes integral to SAP development, organizations must adhere to ethical AI practices. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven decisions is crucial for responsible development.

The integration of AI with SAP ABAP programming marks a transformative leap in SAP development. By infusing intelligence into the coding process, organizations can achieve unparalleled efficiency, code quality, and innovation in their SAP applications. As this synergy between AI and SAP ABAP continues to evolve but it takes some time to get the AI matured to write complex ABAP program logic, it promises to redefine the future of SAP development, empowering organizations to stay agile in the face of technological advancements.",dzone.com,news,dzone.com,,0.2941176470588236,448816346,1,https://dz2cdn1.dzone.com/storage/article-thumb/17583997-thumb.jpg,

President Volodymyr Zlenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

A new video reveals users will have to manually opt-in for third-party chat support under Account settings . Third-party chats will be kept separate from WhatsApp chats, with limited support for features.

WhatsApp is arguably one of the most popular encrypted instant messaging apps on Android, often locking horns with other popular services like Telegram and Signal. However, such popularity attracted regulator attention in the EU, where the European Commission deemed the app a gatekeeper as defined in the Digital Markets Act. To safeguard its plans for continued operations in the market, Meta is giving WhatsApp interoperability with other apps and we now have our first look at the implementation ahead of its official release.

Related iPhone 15 and USB-C: Why Apple is now making the change Apple has hung onto Lightning cables for over a decade but times are changing

Support for integrating with third-party chat apps has been in the works since September 2023, or maybe even before that, but development has been slow, and mostly behind closed doors. As the name suggests, interoperability will allow WhatsApp to receive messages sent from other chat apps like Telegram, and WhatsApp users will be allowed to reply and interact with the sender without exiting the app.

We last spotted Meta discussing this in February, when WhatsApp made it clear the feature will remain exclusive to the ""European Region,"" but it also disclosed the technical specifications, so other apps can join without breaking encryption standards. Although a few related screenshots surfaced earlier, reputable app sleuth AssembleDebug recently shared a video which clarifies several details (via SmartDroid).

Interoperability is just around the corner

From the video, it is evident that the option for third-party chat support will be an opt-in, meaning users will have to enable it manually. The toggle should be available under Settings → Account → Third-party chats. Here, WhatsApp displays a prominent notification warning users that scams and spam may be more prevalent in third-party chats, and they may handle user data differently.

In a subsequent onboarding screen, the app explains that people using other apps could look you up using your phone number, and this may include people you've blocked on WhatsApp. However, Meta doesn't share your name and profile picture with them. Understandably, advanced app features like disappearing messages, stickers, and emoji reactions to messages aren't supported.

On the final screen, you get to choose the supported third-party apps where your phone number will be searchable. The list is empty in the video because the feature hasn't rolled out yet, but you can revisit these settings under Settings → Account → Third-party chats → Selected apps. Once enabled, an option called Third-party chats should show up at the top of the Chats tab. Evidently, Meta plans to keep WhatsApp chats separate from third-party chats, quite like locked conversations.

That said, the UI for this feature seems ready for prime time, and should be due for release very soon. We sincerely hope regulatory pressure forces WhatsApp to make this a standard feature in all markets, but that's just wishful thinking for now.",androidpolice.com,news,Android Police,,0.4588235294117646,448816058,1,https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/whatsapp-colorful-hero.jpg,

The report shows less than favoring results for AI in retail, warning about the trust gap and inaccuracy of AI-driven insights.

The report also highlights that generative AI will shape the future of retail with an estimated $9.2 trillion impact by 2029. However, there is still skepticism among consumers regarding these technologies. Within the study, just 13% of the decision-makers showed confidence in ethical AI usage while 63% expressed concern about potential biases in AI-generated results.

""The AI revolution is about data, trust, and customer experience.

The trick is choosing a path that maximises profits, or at least minimises costs, while ensuring that the industry continues to prosper.

Australia is the world's largest exporter of iron ore, the key raw material used to make steel, and it shipped out about 930 million metric tons last year, which at current prices would be worth about $93 billion.

Australia is also the world's largest exporter of metallurgical coal, used to make steel, ranks second in thermal coal and in liquefied natural gas, while also being the biggest exporter of lithium and the largest net exporter of gold.

But the exports of all these commodities together barely exceed the value of iron ore shipments, underscoring the outsized role of the ore, which is mainly produced in the state of Western Australia.

Just over 80% of iron ore exports head to China, which buys about 70% of the total global seaborne volumes and produces about half of the world's total steel.

Putting these numbers together gives a picture of a dominant producer and a dominant buyer in the iron ore market.

The rise of China since the late nineties allowed Australia's iron ore miners to massively ramp up output, reap economies of scale and become hugely profitable.

But the nature of both China's demand and the process of making steel are likely to change in the next few years, threatening the current model whereby Australia produces vast quantities of iron ore that is turned into steel in blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, processes that require the use of coking coal.

China's steel output has flatlined for the past five years around the 1 billion ton per annum level, and most analysts presenting at this week's Global Iron Ore and Steel Outlook Conference in Perth predicted that production will gradually decline in the next few years.

This is partly because China's infrastructure and housing construction will ease, but also because China will increasingly use scrap steel in electric arc furnaces to produce new steel products.

While Australia's iron ore miners may be able to offset the loss of some of China's demand by selling to newer steel producers in Southeast Asia, it's likely that the overall market for iron ore will soon decline.

It's also likely to change in composition, with higher grades of iron ore preferred as these can be more easily used as a feedstock along with scrap in electric arc furnaces.

Higher grades of iron ore can also more easily be upgraded into direct reduction iron (DRI), which in turn can be turned into steel without using coal as a fuel.

Making steel using DRI produced with green hydrogen and renewable energy is one of the ways the industry is thinking of reducing carbon emissions.

Even using natural gas to make DRI can reduce emissions by up to 75%.

The problem is that DRI is tricky to export given it can be volatile, so it tends to be made at the same location as the steel furnaces.

Value chains

So, if Australia's iron ore miners are thinking of moving up the steel value chain, they would have to find ways of producing DRI and turning it into steel in Australia, using renewable energy.

Another path is upgrading the iron ore into hot briquetted iron (HBI), which is an upgraded form of DRI, whereby the DRI is converted into a compact form using heat.

HBI can be shipped, and can be used in either an electric arc furnace or a basic oxygen unit.

Should Australia's iron ore miners move to upgrade their product, they will need significant investment, and there is no certainty that the upgraded products will deliver sufficiently higher margins.

For example, if an iron ore miner agreed with its customers in China, Japan and South Korea to supply HBI instead of iron ore fines, this would require significant investment in a clean energy system.

The iron ore miners have been successful in running complex operations at low costs, but setting up a wind/solar power plants, a green hydrogen electrolyser and possibly battery storage as well would be a totally different challenge.

There is also the possibility of exporting iron ore to a third country for processing into HBI, with Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia a potential destination.

These countries have large quantities of natural gas which could be used to turn iron ore into HBI in a process that would still be more environmentally friendly than using coking coal.

The HBI could then be shipped from the Middle East to customers in Asia.

However, there are several other factors that would come into play, such as steel nationalism.

Many countries see steel as a key commodity and want to retain their own industries. It's unlikely Japan would want to buy green steel from Australia, but it might be prepared to buy HBI and keep the final process of making steel inside its borders.

The problem for Australia's iron ore sector is that it has a plethora of options in adjusting to decarbonization and peak steel in China.

But all involve risks and costs, and this is trouble for an industry that has spent the last decade de-risking itself and concentrating on improving shareholder returns.",mining.com,news,MINING.COM,,0.2156862745098038,448815489,1,https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BHP-announces-first-production-from-South-Flank.jpg,eng-9409942

Grid-connected microgrid controller is expected to have the largest market share in the forecast period.

The grid-connected segment leads the microgrid controller market. These microgrids contribute to grid resilience, enhance power quality, and exhibit minimal environmental impact. They are typically linked to large utility grids and serve diverse areas ranging from small residential clusters to expansive installations like military bases. Power transmission in grid-connected microgrids relies on the main grids; hence, any disruptions to these grids affect overall power transmission networks.

Solar PV technology predominantly powers grid-connected microgrids, which encompass multiple generators, distribution systems, and advanced controls. These microgrids draw on the main power grid for primary energy supply, balance, and backup. Grid-connected microgrids offer more reliable power generation than remote/island microgrids, as they can generate power within their distribution circuits and import it from utility sources.

The microgrid market in the Americas is growing rapidly due to the increase of distributed energy plants and the decrease in energy storage costs. This growth is particularly noticeable in the US. Grid-connected microgrids facilitate renewable energy integration without extensive upgrades, thereby enhancing energy efficiency, resilience, and curbing carbon emissions.

Software & Services offering of the microgrid controller market is predicted to register the highest CAGR in the forecast period.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the more than two-year-long war, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the national utility Ukrenergo.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he told The Associated Press. He said the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, suffered the most damage.

Last winter, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelensky has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the US

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelensky said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

Russian officials refer to the conflict as a ""special military operation,"" eschewing the word ""war."" But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attracted attention on Friday by telling a Russian newspaper that ""when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.""

He later told reporters in a conference call that ?This is not connected with any kind of juridical change. It is de jure an SVO,"" the Russian acronym for special military operation.

Both Peskov and President Vladimir Putin have occasionally used the word ""war"" about the fighting in Ukraine.",thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,,-0.5137254901960784,448814303,1,https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4286221-1315746943.jpg,

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskiy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskiy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskiy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

(Full bio)

Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, often comes up with new ideas that make headlines. He recently shared a proposal that might help those planning to buy a hybrid car: a substantial reduction in taxes on hybrid vehicles. Speaking at News18's Rising Bharat Summit 2024, Mr. Gadkari proposed reducing the current 48 percent GST on hybrid vehicles to 12 percent. This reduction could significantly affect the prices of popular hybrid cars like the Toyota Innova Hycross in the market.

The Toyota Innova Hycross, launched some time ago, has captured buyers' attention, much like its predecessors, the Innova and Innova Crysta. Toyota offers a strong hybrid version of the MPV in the market, with prices starting at Rs 25.72 lakh ex-showroom and going up to Rs 30.698 lakh ex-showroom.

For this discussion, we are only considering the top-end hybrid variant of the Innova Hycross. Currently, if you plan to buy the top-end ZX(O) Hybrid Innova Hycross, you will have to spend Rs 35.5 lakh to get the car on the road. This price includes the ex-showroom price, RTO charges, insurance, CESS, and GST for both state and center.

In the current scenario, the ex-showroom price includes 28 percent GST (both state and center) and 15 percent CESS. If we remove these two elements, the ex-factory cost of the Innova Hycross Hybrid is Rs 21.5 lakh only.

Now, let's consider the proposal put forward by Mr. Gadkari. If the GST on hybrid cars is reduced to 12 percent, it would affect the overall price of the car. After the reduction of GST, the ex-showroom cost of the Innova Hycross Hybrid will be around Rs 25.5 lakh. This includes 15 percent CESS and 12 percent GST.

This reduction will make a significant difference in the price of this vehicle. If you notice, the ex-showroom price is around Rs 5.5 lakh less than the current price. With the revised tax amount, there would be a drop in the on-road price of the vehicle as well. Depending on the city you are from, we can see a difference of around Rs 7-10 lakh in the on-road price of the vehicle.

Similarly, other hybrid models like the Grand Vitara, Toyota HyRyder, and Honda City Hybrid can expect a drop in price.

The top-end Alpha Plus DT Hybrid variant of the Grand Vitara costs Rs 20.09 lakh ex-showroom. This includes 28 percent GST and 15 percent CESS. If the GST is reduced to 12 percent, the ex-showroom price of the car would also be reduced.

The ex-factory cost of the Grand Vitara will be around Rs 11.45 lakh. If you include 12 percent GST and 15 percent CESS, the new ex-showroom price would be Rs 14.54 lakh, a difference of almost Rs 5.5 lakh.

The Toyota Hyryder, which also has a similar price tag to the Grand Vitara, will also see a similar reduction in price. We can expect a price drop of Rs 5-6 lakh easily. The last car in this article is the Honda City Hybrid. The top-end ZX CVT hybrid variant of the City is priced at Rs 20.39 lakh ex-showroom, which is more expensive than the Grand Vitara.

After reducing the 28 percent GST and CESS, the ex-factory price of the City Hybrid is Rs 14.37 lakh. If you add the 12 percent GST and 15 percent CESS, the amount would be around Rs 18.25 lakh. Even then, there is a considerable difference in ex-showroom pricing, which will reflect in the on-road price too.",cartoq.com,news,CarToq - India’s #1 auto content site,Ajeesh Kuttan,0.3490196078431373,448813748,1,https://www.cartoq.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nitin-gadkari-gst-hybrid-cars-toyota-innova-hycross.jpg,

A new forum in Limerick aims to promote the integration of migrants into the community.

The Limerick Migrant Integration Forum was established by Limerick City and County Council (LCCC) as part of the EU INTEgreat Project in partnership with Doras.

The forum aims to empower migrant communities in Limerick to collaborate and network to promote social inclusion, integration and active participation in key decision-making bodies and networks in the region.

The Forum has over 40 members from over 20 diverse backgrounds, each contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of Limerick.

Speaking at the event, Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, Cllr Gerald Mitchell says the Forum has wasted no time in getting to work: ""I had the privilege of chairing the Inaugural meeting of the Limerick Migrant Integration Forum in November 2023 and it has already shown its value. The Forum has been extremely active and to the fore of many great initiatives including the organisation of Africa Day and supporting the Ukrainian community. It is exciting to consider the possibilities for the future as this Forum empowers and supports Limerick's many diverse cultures.""

On the occasion of International Anti-Racism Day, Ms. Kate Njoku, Chair of Limerick Migrant Integration Forum said: ""This forum stands as a voice and representation for all migrants within our communities. Racism has been proven to have damaging consequences for migrants who already may have found themselves in extremely difficult and harsh living conditions, especially women and children. Today we join other global communities to advocate for the total eradication of racial discrimination in all of its form.""

Although only recently formed, the Migrant Integration Forum is already active in promoting integration in the region.

The Forum actively stood in solidarity with the Ukrainian community at a recent event to mark the 2nd anniversary of the Russian invasion. It participated in the recent St. Patrick's Day parade, winning Best Community Award. Finally, the Limerick Migrant Integration Forum will be a main organiser of Africa Day with support from Doras & Limerick City and County Council.",live95fm.ie,news,Limerick's Live 95,,0.2313725490196079,448813398,1,https://mmo.aiircdn.com/301/65fd93332391c.jpg,

Since 2019, the FlexTech Chair has successfully contributed to the discipline of human systems integration in the increasingly autonomous systems niche. This ongoing program focuses on five key objectives:

Human systems integration (HSI) seriously considers people and organizations in designing new technology by continuously developing approaches, methods, and tools that support engineering designers and systems architects, and ultimately human-systems integrators. HSI is at the intersection of human and social sciences, systems engineering, human- computer interaction (HCI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). It supports digital engineering in the development of life-critical complex systems. In addition to its involvement in cutting-edge research and teaching, the FlexTech Chair has consulting resources to support the industry in its strategic

and tactical efforts.

We contributed to developing a consistent terminology and, to some extent, an acceptable ontology in the rapidly expanding field of human systems integration (HSI). We often define HSI as a process and a product at the confluence of several areas, such as systems engineering, human factors and ergonomics, information technology, and specific sectors, such as aerospace, health, and energy. It is a broader transdisciplinary field in our increasingly complex human-machine world that focuses on integrating technology, organizations, and people within a complex sociotechnical system throughout its life cycle.

Therefore, HSI is no longer a question of usability and user interface design once a complex machine is technologically developed but also about considering people and organizations early in the design and development processes. Indeed, rooted in industrial engineering research and operational worlds, HSI requires a deeper foundation based on an epistemological approach. This assertion is even more crucial today as technology has become predominantly digital, and, more specifically, the concept of the digital twin is emphasized because it has become essential to support model-based HSI (MB-HSI). In other words, software-based assistant systems are replacing traditional tools.

Therefore, appropriate social-cognitive (multi-agent) models and methods are helpful throughout the life cycle of contemporary sociotechnical designs to account for the complexity and tangibility of their human-centered context-sensitive architectures, combining procedural and declarative knowledge. Considering these reasons, this article provides a set of fundamental axioms, some theoretical abstractions, and valuable practical models, which are presented and illustrated through an evolutionary HSI ontology.

Until the 1980s, most tasks and activities were primarily physical.

Thus, human factors have long been linked to biomechanics, physiological health, and safety. For this reason, HFE specialists were primarily physiologists and bio-mechanists. Then, computing capabilities developed considerably over the last two decades of the 20th century. For example, several onboard computer systems were created and installed on aircraft. More importantly, from this point onward, HCI emerged as a discipline not only because microcomputers invaded all areas of our lives, including our homes, but also because there was a need to master emerging cognitive activities.

In this way, cognitive psychology and anthropology had a huge role in the development of cognitive engineering, which greatly supported HCI. Then, HCI gradually penetrated HFE. HCI researchers and practitioners developed numerous task analysis methods during the 1980s and 1990s, and most importantly, interaction design became an effective practice. Human-Centered Design (HCD) began to develop within HCI and thus was limited to computer systems: some have called it Human-Centered Computing!

Then, in the first two decades of the 21st century, the power of software and computer networks began to offer a wide range of possibilities, including improved modeling and simulation, more meaningful visualizations, advanced interaction media, and AI. These new capabilities have led to a radical departure from traditional engineering practices. Indeed, digital engineering has become a concrete industrial practice that enables virtual testing of activities at the design stage and, of course, throughout the life cycle of a system.

At the same time, complexity has increased dramatically due to global interconnectivity. HSI has, therefore, naturally become one of the major disciplines to support the management and mastery of this digital shift. As the user interface gradually emerged as a syndrome of 20th-century technology- centered processes, STS designers began to realize that it was possible to include people throughout the life cycle of a system.

For a long time, automation and human error have led technology-centered approaches to view people as problems rather than solutions to emerging critical issues. This view is mainly due to the failure to consider the evolution of operational contexts and the maturity of STSs. Indeed, eliminating humans from the control and decision-making loops can solve problems when the context is very well specified and covers many expected situations.

However, in unexpected situations, humans must solve problems 'on their own' but often need the help of more knowledgeable and experienced technological, organizational, and human resources. Our research program approach follows James Reason's statement: ""Fallibility is part of the human condition. Although we cannot change the human condition, we can change the conditions under which humans work.""

""Decarbonize"" means to stop depending on carbon dioxide emissions - hence the word decarbonization - to produce the goods and services that satisfy our needs, such as food, clothing, electronic devices, transportation, or buildings. We emit a lot of CO₂ in these processes, because the main source of energy we use - more than 80% of the total - for this production are fossil fuels: oil, gas and coal. Getting energy from these materials means burning them, and doing so emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide -CO₂ in its chemical formulation- is a gas that promotes the greenhouse effect in the Earth's atmosphere, that is, it is transparent to the solar radiation that reaches the surface of the planet but makes it difficult for the radiation to escape towards the planet. space. ""The more greenhouse gases the Earth's atmosphere has, the higher the planet's surface temperature must be to be able to return energy to outer space. For this reason, the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produces what is called global warming, that is, the increase in the Earth's temperature,"" explains Greta Tresserra, sustainability member of the Col legi. d'Arquitectes de Catalunya.

This global increase in temperature produces large changes in the climate of different regions. This implies very important and very rapid alterations in the ecosystems of the biosphere, which see the conditions in which they develop altered - including those controlled directly by man, such as agricultural plantations, forests or pastures. Climate change is already causing major alterations that affect a very important and growing part of the human population. And if the average temperature of the planet's surface rises more than 2 C compared to the temperature prior to the systematic use of fossil fuels, the costs of climate change will be unaffordable and the damage irreparable.

Using fossil fuels as the main energy source is at the basis of industrialization, of the productive model that feeds the quality of life of modern societies. The Industrial Revolution was based on the use of coal as an energy source, and since then the evolution and extension of our modern society has also been supported by oil and natural gas. Everything we produce and transport around the world uses energy that, for the most part, comes from fossil fuels. Therefore, decarbonizing society is a major challenge: ""it means changing the energy model of our production and consumption system, changing the basis of our model of life,"" says Tresserra.

This change in the energy model is based on two fundamental strategies. The first, change fossil energy sources towards so-called renewable energies. Solar energy and wind energy are the sources relied on for the change in model. But the photovoltaic panels that transform solar energy into electrical energy, as well as the windmills that do it with the wind, require very specific materials that are found in low concentration in the mines, and large amounts of energy are needed to separate them from the minerals that contain them. Building the infrastructure required by an energy system based on renewable energy requires a lot of energy and, of course, the energy we have now is essentially energy from fossil sources. Thus, building a renewable future implies extra consumption of fossil fuels and may not be available to meet current energy demands. This is what is called the energy trap.

That is why the second strategy is essential: reduce the amount of energy necessary to produce what we need and, at the same time, adjust our needs to those that are possible in a decarbonized world. Energy efficiency in a sustainable model. An essential social change that does not follow the line of the current model of continuous growth in production fueled by the energy system based on energy from fossil sources.

Thus, the satisfaction of needs must be redefined in a sustainable world, considering basic needs, such as food, health and housing, priority. It is interesting to look at the challenge posed by the decarbonization of our buildings as an example of the complexity of the global decarbonization challenge.

In Europe, the energy used in buildings accounts for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions. If it is necessary to decarbonize our society, it is essential to decarbonize buildings. And this involves several tasks. The first is knowing how to build buildings that are very efficient in the use of energy - energy efficiency - and that the little they need comes from renewable energy captured by the building itself. Even the building captures more energy than it uses and can become a supplier to cover the rest of social needs. This is already possible today and, from 2030, European regulations will require all new buildings to be like this. But this does not solve the problem.

We have a huge built park that has not been built in this way, but uses energy - mostly fossil - without much efficiency to generate comfort and shelter activities. In Spain there are more than 23 million homes - 18 of them main homes - and 2 million service buildings - offices, commercial, educational, etc. - in operation. According to Greta Tresserra, ""if we do not significantly improve its energy efficiency, we will not be able to decarbonize our society. That is why it is necessary to carry out important rehabilitation policies for the stock of existing buildings that allow them to be decarbonized -high energy efficiency and the little energy they require is renewable and as local as possible- in 2050."" Do we have enough? Not yet.

The manufacturing of the materials with which we build new buildings and rehabilitate existing ones today involves the emission of significant quantities of CO₂. Like the entire industrial system, the production of construction materials depends on fossil fuels and it also needs to be decarbonized before 2050. This is a great challenge, and the main materials - cement, steel, aluminum, ceramics - already propose decarbonization trajectories that, we hope, can be effective. But the sector can also recover traditional materials that require little or no emissions and help reduce these emissions.

In short, the building sector shows us the path towards decarbonization: high energy efficiency and use of renewables as a model, transforming the existing one towards this objective, and a change in material culture that allows us to reach that essential future. A process of change that forces us to redefine our way of living.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least five people, officials said Friday.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the more than two-year-long war, said Volodymyr Kudrytsky, head of the national utility Ukrenergo.

""This attack was especially dangerous because the adversary combined different means of attack, kamikaze drones, ballistic and cruise missiles,"" he told The Associated Press. He said the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, suffered the most damage.

Last winter, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

The Ford F-150 fitted with the optional PowerBoost turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 and permanent-magnet motor, currently offers the highest range figure in the hybrid truck segment. The EPA doesn't provide an official estimate, but Ford claims this model covers over 700 miles on a single tank, with some assistance from the electrical system. Ford doesn't break down how this changes between various trims, but the claim bests its biggest rival's figures.

Ford offers the hybrid engine option from the XLT trim with the 4x4 four-wheel drive system. It's a fairly simple but robust parallel hybrid system that lays a solid foundation for an upcoming PHEV model, which will bridge the gap between the standard and all-electric F-150 Lightning range. For the time being, there is no other hybrid truck available in the new car market that can best the F-150 Hybrid's claimed range figures.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Ford's websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA, Car and Driver, and Edmunds.

The Ford F-150 Hybrid Covers Over 700 Miles On A Tank

Close

Ford estimates that its F-150 Hybrid range covers an average of 700 miles on a single tank of gas. This is partly thanks to its large 36-gallon tank and supplementary 1.5 kWh battery pack. The hybrid derivative boasts an all-new PowerBoost turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 and a single-permanent-magnet motor attached to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Ford only offers this with its four-wheel drive system.

(Data sourced from Ford and the EPA)

This configuration generates a combined 430 horsepower and 570 pound-feet, resulting in a rather mediocre 22/24/23 MPG estimate on the EPA's city/highway/combined cycle if you specify the most efficient XLT trim. The F-150's hybrid system is a supplementary unit, so it features very limited EV capabilities.

The Ford F-150 Hybrid Costs $52,705

The F-150 Hybrid range starts at $52,705 if you opt for the most basic XLT SuperCrew with a 5-1/2 bed. This engine is also available in the Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum trims, which range up to $73,735 before you specify the $1,900 hybrid engine option. Ford's decision to offer the hybrid engine across most of its trim is a welcome decision, as some of its rivals only provide the cleaner engine option in the higher trims, exclusively.

As a result, the F-150 Hybrid undercuts most of its rivals, including the Toyota Tundra iForce MAX. The Ford F-150 Hybrid's price excludes the $1,995 destination charge. Despite being a hybrid, you don't benefit from tax rebates like you would with a PHEV or fully electric car.

The Ford F-150 Hybrid Can Tow Up To 11,200 Pounds

The F-150 Hybrid isn't the best option for towing, but it holds its own fairly when pulling a load. The brand claims the hybrid model will pull up to 11,200 pounds and carry a 2,120-pound payload. The brand also claims it'll sprint from 0-60 MPH in an impressive 5.7 seconds and limits top speed to 107 MPH. Independent tests reveal the truck can cut this time down to 5.4 seconds in ideal conditions.

The Ford F-150 Is Built To Work

Ford designs its current-generation F-150 to be a functional workhorse truck. It improves on convenience, capacity, and ingenuity compared to the last-generation model. The Pro Access Tailgate is one of its key features, as it puts you up to 19 inches closer to the truck bed for easier reach inside. It is also the only truck in its class to offer a 100-degree fully opened integrated tailgate, allowing ample room to easily gain access even when hitched to a trailer. You can also fold this part down like a traditional tailgate.

You're also treated to under-seat storage inside the cab to secure items while freeing up interior seating space. The available Interior Work Surface provides all the room needed to get the job done. The stowable shifter allows you to open and transform your center console into a flat work surface, creating the perfect for working on a laptop or tablet.

Denmark and other seafaring states should call for harmonised international legislation, standardised conduct and the creation of robust oversight mechanisms.

According to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, only state vessels are mandated to combat maritime piracy. However, private security companies supplement state efforts to protect seafarers and ensure freedom of navigation in piracy-prone regions. This is particularly the case in the western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea.

Private vessel protection rocketed in the 2010s, when piracy disturbed the freedom of navigation of vessels transiting the vital chokepoint for international trade in the Indian Ocean. In this theatre, no ships with armed guards onboard were ever successfully hijacked, and private protection was deemed largely effective.

In the Gulf of Guinea, the situation is different both legally and geographically. As Denmark has an estimated 30-40 vessels within the Gulf of Guinea at any given point, this calls for renewed consideration of how to manage private security operations at sea.

The Gulf of Guinea became a global piracy hotspot between 2015 and 2020, with 95% of all attacks globally taking place in the Gulf of Guinea in 2020. The waters mainly affected are off the coast of Nigeria, Togo and Benin, with Nigeria as the epicentre. Inadequate maritime surveillance and law enforcement, coupled with increasingly violent attacks, have led some merchant vessels to rely on private protection.

To cater to the persistent security gap, the region developed protection services in new public-private security constellations (see Box 1). For instance, the Nigerian, Togolese and Beninois navies began offering embarked military personnel at a fee. By 2017, this model began to fade when Nigeria started to strongly enforce its existing policy against embarked armed guards of any kind - whether private security or public military personnel. The government instead licensed specific private military security companies (PMSCs), today about 50 in number, which shipping companies may contract to provide escort vessels. The vessels must be manned and commanded by Nigerian Navy personnel, who operate under national rules of engagement.

The public-private constellation seems an acceptable compromise. For Nigeria, it allows the state to retain its monopoly over the use of force and remain the primary actor in safeguarding its territorial waters. Moreover, because navy personnel operate on private security vessels, the state's limited number of patrol vessels are freed up for other tasks.

For merchant shipping, the constellation provides vessels the needed protection without the burden of embarking private armed guards, which is generally resisted by the industry.

The model is likely to stay for as long as Nigerian naval resource and capability limitations impede the state's ability to effectively address piracy in its waters. However, it arguably also provides an incentive for the state to remain in a status quo, since the state both saves and makes money on this constellation.

Moreover, several conditions complicate the use of private security in the Gulf of Guinea. Merchant vessels transiting the region call on multiple ports along the coast. This firstly means that they sail into coastal states' territorial waters, where laws are more restrictive than on the high seas - no state in the Gulf of Guinea region (or elsewhere for that matter) readily allows private security companies to operate and carry arms within their territory. Secondly, vessels transit multiple states' territorial waters, which only complicates the already restrictive regulation.

These conditions have led to a number of arrests and weapons seizures - of private security actors. For example, in 2013 when private armed guards were found onboard vessels off Senegal and in 2019 when Nigerian authorities claimed that a private security detachment was within its territorial waters.

Several potential challenges exist with outsourcing a state's governance obligations to private companies. Conventionally understood as a public good, security as a commodity can challenge democratic principles, as private companies are not as accountable as a state. This inserts an array of risks concerning responsibility and liability.

Politically, transparency is an issue with practices of contracting and sub-contracting - and the lack of public debate and scrutiny - because a shipping company's hiring of private security does not entail political processes, as when public forces are deployed. This opacity also plays out in the Gulf of Guinea. Although public actors are involved in all instances of contracting PMSCs (as in the case of Nigeria), questions remain about which criteria exist for vetting and licensing PMSCs. For instance, no due diligence can be conducted on naval personnel embarked on escort vessels to determine their level of preparedness for addressing piracy incidents. Yet, it is known that only a handful of the 50 vetted companies are fully operational with the necessary fuel, vessels and availability of spare parts in case of damage. Furthermore, for regional navies providing vessel escort, not all patrol vessels are purpose-built, which sometimes impedes their ability to provide effective protection.

Legally, private armed guards are not permitted in the territorial waters of Gulf of Guinea states. Moreover, private security companies are not directly bound by human rights law, unless states practice (their legal obligation to conduct) due diligence and hold companies to account to relevant treaties, in this case by way of the shipping employer (see Box 2). It is therefore the individual flag state that must manage the governance of private security, leading to differences in requirements for private security companies. With the industry's common practice of open ship registries - known as flags of convenience - regulation also remains unclear, scattered and often unrestrictive. Concerns include ensuring oversight regarding company licencing, private security operations' handling of weapons or adherence to international standards and obligations under international law, for instance, during an exchange of fire.

Economically, private protection may also be a logistical and financial burden for vessels transiting multiple Gulf of Guinea states. This requires contracting and arranging navy escorts or secure anchorage services across multiple states (see map). Questions also remain as to who should bear the cost of engaging private maritime security companies. For instance, if costs are borne by flag states, they might pay closer attention to vessel registration procedures to ensure that vessels have adequate security and safety measures in place. If the costs are borne by the coastal state, this might incentivise authorities to be more proactive about counter-piracy efforts. Costs borne by shipping companies are often merely tolerated and then passed on to consumers. Distributing the cost burden more evenly could therefore create a fair balance of incentives across the multiple actors involved in or directly impacted by counter-piracy efforts.

The number of piracy incidents in the Gulf of Guinea has declined considerably since 2020. This is in part ascribed to the increased focus on naval surveillance and patrol, hereunder the public-private hybrid. However, there is a wide concern that a wave of attacks may return from one day to the next as long as motives and means remain. If existing public-private security hybrids continue, their challenges must be solved.

For seafaring states like Denmark, there is a clear need to advocate for a harmonised legal framework in the Gulf of Guinea aimed at regulating the operations of PMSCs and the public-private hybrid currently consolidating in the region. This framework could incorporate international standards for the operation of PMSCs in the region, including operational procedures and accountability mechanisms.

Advocacy for agreeing on the instrument for the Regulation, Monitoring and Oversight of Private Military and Security Companies is needed.

Furthermore, the creation of - and measures for strict adherence to - due diligence processes are needed regarding the licensing of PMSCs in regions like Nigeria and when they are hired by shipping companies. At all levels, transparency is key in ensuring both accountability and adherence to international legal frameworks and norms.

Finally, clear guidelines also need to be established on cost-sharing mechanisms for the engagement of PMSCs, including effectively balancing the financial burden between operators, charterers and, where possible, regional states.",diis.dk,news,DIIS,,0.2705882352941176,448812633,1,,

Meta has unveiled a beta version of its social networking application, Threads, which now supports integration with the ""Fediverse"" through the ActivityPub protocol. The Fediverse is an ensemble of interconnected social networks which can communicate with each other. Integrating Threads with the Fediverse allows users over the age of 18 with public profiles in certain countries to share their Threads posts across various ActivityPub-compliant servers. ActivityPub, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, facilitates interoperability among social networks that adopt it, marking a significant step towards open and federated social networking.

The integration presents technical challenges, particularly with features like quote posts, which lack a formal specification in ActivityPub. Meta's engineers, Christopher Su and Simon Blackstein, have highlighted the innovative solutions being adopted to overcome these hurdles, including leveraging methods developed by the federated microblogging project Misskey. They also outline a phased approach to further integration, promising that future updates will allow content from the Fediverse to flow into Threads, enabling federated Threads users to view and interact with replies from other servers and follow users across the Fediverse directly within Threads.

Meta's move to integrate Threads with the Fediverse is seen as an attempt to offer a more interoperable experience, potentially attracting users from other platforms and fostering a broader online community. This strategy may also provide Meta with valuable insights into user behavior across different platforms, which is crucial for its business model. The integration acknowledges the growing trend of users seeking alternatives to traditional social networks, offering them the benefits of a federated ecosystem while maintaining the familiar user experience of platforms like Threads.",winbuzzer.com,news,WinBuzzer,Luke Jones,0.3176470588235294,448812084,1,https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fediverse-Threads-Meta-Mobile.jpg,eng-9418652

According to the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, Russia's most recent attack on the country became the largest attack on the energy system of Ukraine in recent times.

Power outages were reported in several regions of the country. Kharkiv was left without electricity and water supplies almost completely. Train delays were also reported.

Attacks on energy infrastructure were recorded in Krivoy Rog, Lviv and Dnepropetrovsk. The authorities of the Vinnytsia region reported damage to a critical infrastructure facility. Internet outages have been reported in many areas of the country.

While effectively handling basic customer inquiries, their applications extend to streamlining internal processes like data entry, document processing, and compliance checks.

This blog post dives into the integration of artificial intelligence in chatbots for banking. Learn the challenges these digital ""employees"" can address and benefits they bring to your business.

AI-powered chatbots tackle numerous challenges in allowing banking applications to focus on better delivery of complex financial services. These include streamlining customer service, automating back-office processes, enhancing compliance, and driving cost efficiencies. Learn about the role of AI chatbots in banking software in more details below.

Artificial intelligence processes hundreds of thousands of questions with readily available solutions. Considering that a substantial proportion of calls to technical support are made to:

It becomes evident that all these issues can be promptly resolved through the implementation of artificial intelligence, thereby significantly alleviating the workload of live consultants for more substantial problems.

All data a user conveys to artificial intelligence remains securely stored within the corporation's strictly protected environments. Corporations must learn to train their proprietary technologies instead of utilising pre-existing solutions. This approach further enhances data security, preventing any leakage to third parties. It is bluntly stated that if you inadvertently disclose excess information to a human consultant, there is a potential risk of misuse. Conversely, artificial intelligence lacks such capabilities, theoretically rendering it a trustworthy repository for confidential data fragments.

If you look at the money needed to pay people for technical support versus the expenses of keeping a server running for AI, it's clear that there's a big difference in long-term costs. Not only must each employee receive a substantial salary, but the company must also provide various insurance contributions. In contrast, the expense of an uninterrupted cloud server would amount to a maximum of $100-300 per month, excluding the one-time cost of integrating AI into the system. The price difference is conspicuous.

It's already clear that AI has revolutionized customer support. With fewer employees, service has improved over the past decade, efficiently handling common questions. In the banking world, chatbots quickly gather customer information. Instead of manually searching databases, employees now just need to ask a question, and AI can suggest suitable options, such as loans and interest rates, based on available information.

AI-powered chatbots are making waves in banking software acting as an excellent tool for optimization of internal processes allowing companies enhanced customer service.

When it comes to harnessing the power of AI for banking applications, S-Pro comes in as a pioneer in the field. Their expertise highlighted in dozens of completed projects that comes with a tailored approach make S-Pro your only tech partner for seamless integration of artificial intelligence into your banking software.",abcmoney.co.uk,news,ABC Money,Claire James,0.4666666666666666,448810632,1,https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thumbnail_AdobeStock_614888720-1.jpg,eng-9417060

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

HOHHOT, March 22 -- The first set of 131-meter-long onshore wind turbine blades, the longest in the world, have been successfully produced in Bayannur, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to local authorities.

The blades rolled off assembly line on Thursday at the Sany Renewable Energy in the Bayannur zero carbon smart industrial park. They will be installed in large megawatt wind turbine units, thereby boosting wind power generation capacity and efficiency.

The new blades exhibit excellent stability and durability, challenging the limits of manufacturing materials in terms of stiffness and strength and driving innovation in modern manufacturing technology. The wind turbine blades have already undergone component and full-size testing.

Sany Renewable Energy has transitioned from traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, and enhanced product precision through digitalization technology, sources with the company said. Additionally, these blades use recyclable polyurethane structural components to improve recyclability while achieving mass production.

The zero carbon smart industrial park covers an area of approximately 540 mu (36 hectares) with a total investment of about 1 billion yuan (about 138.3 million U.S. dollars).

The Dnepr Hydro Power Plant (HPP), a vital source of energy for Ukraine, has been severely damaged following a massive wave of Russian strikes, the head of the facility's operating company said on Friday.

The Dnepr HPP, located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. It was directly hit by two Russian missiles, the head of operator Ukrhydroenergo, Igor Sirota, claimed an interview with Radio Svoboda, a branch of the US-funded RFE/RL.

Zaporozhye Region voted to join Russia in the fall of 2022, although parts of the region are still held by Ukrainian troops.

The Ukrhydroenergo head offered a grim assessment of the situation at the Dnepr facility, saying ""we are losing the plant."" He added that the second unit of the plant had been hit, and that ""the support has been damaged... In other words, Dnepr HPP-2 is in critical condition, Dnepr HPP-1 is not operational either.""

Ukrhydroenergo is currently assessing the extent of the damage to the second unit, but a fire has complicated those efforts, Sirota added. It is clear at this point that the entire main generator hall and electrical equipment will need to be restored, he claimed, although he said there is no danger of a dam breach.

Sirota reported that no one was killed in the Russian strikes on the facility, although Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said there was one casualty.

A video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Russia missile moving toward the plant at high speed, before a powerful explosion rocks the facility.

Built in the early days of the Soviet Union during a period of large-scale industrialization, the Dnepr hydroelectric plant is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region and is a crucial source of energy for Kiev.

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched dozens of missiles and drones targeting the country's energy infrastructure in one of the most powerful barrages in weeks, causing widespread blackouts. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said several mines in Dnepropetrovsk Region and part of Kiev-controlled territory in Russia's Donetsk Region had been cut off from electricity.

Today we'll be looking at one of Thermalright's AIOs, the Frozen Edge 360. It is powered by 3 of Thermalright's TL-B12 120mm fans which have seen decent reviews online, paired with a 3300RPM liquid pump, and features a solid black design with minor ARGB accents for the CPU block.

However, none of these features are what grabs our attention - the price is what really makes Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360 stand out from the competition, as it is available for less than $60 USD. This is the cheapest 360mm AIO I've ever tested, and so I didn't have high expectations for it when I began testing. With such a low price, can Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360 compete with more expensive AIOs on the market which are typically twice as expensive or more?

The liquid cooling market has become much more competitive over the past two years, but most of the best performing AIOs are still $120 or more. Thermalright somehow managed to price the Frozen Edge 360 at half that price, only $60 USD on Amazon.com! I don't know how they're making any profit on these things with such a low price!

Like most other AIOs on the market, the Frozen Edge 360 doesn't interfere or overhang DIMM slots - making it compatible with RAM of any height! The CPU block is black, with an etched metal top that showcases Thermalright's branding. On the sides of the block is a single ARGB lighting strip, giving it a subtle - you might call it ""minimalist"" - illumination.

Included with the unit are 3x cable management clips for the tubing of the AIO.

Included is a small tube of thermal paste suitable for a few applications.

Most manufacturers don't secure the fans to the radiator of the device, leaving it up to the user to install. Thermalright has opted to pre-install the fans to save users a few moments of their time.

The CPU block is comprised of a large copper plate, bigger than some competitors on the market. The tubing is braided and is rotatable for ease of installation and routing.

With the fans installed to the radiator, the Frozen Edge 360 measures 53mm in height. This should fit well with most standard cases on the market.

The cooler is protected during shipment by molded cardboard, plastic coverings, and a foam top covering. Included with the cooler is:

I've tested with Intel's i7-13700K to show how this cooler performs. The system system is tested with a full strength workload, two reduced wattage loads, and at noise normalized settings.

Observant readers may notice that the noise graphs start at 35 instead of zero. This is because my sound meter cannot measure sound levels lower than 35 dBA. This makes it the ""zero"" for testing purposes. For those concerned that this might distort results - there's no worry. If anything, the graphs above will minimize the differences in noise levels because dBA measurements are logarithmic.

The installation of the liquid cooler is straightforward and easy. I advise securing the radiator to your computer case before proceeding for easiest installation.

Most coolers reach TJ Max, the maximum temperature of the CPU of 100 degrees Celsius, when power limits are removed with Intel's i7-13700K. However, the strongest AIOs are able to keep this CPU under its peak temperature, even in stressful conditions. Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360's performance matches the best AIOs on the market, delivering thermal domination for $60 - sustaining an average temperature of 90C during testing.

Performance is only one part of the picture, noise levels are equally important. At 47.7 dBA, this cooler is a bit noisy - at the edge of my comfort level. However, it is cooler than many other AIOs on the market.

If you're particular about noise levels, our next results will show you how it performs when it runs quietly.

For noise normalized testing, I've set the fans to a low 38.2 dBA. This is a slightly audible noise level, but won't bother most users. Thermalright's Frozen Edge performs excellently here cooling an average of 234W, outperforming competing 360mm AIOs from both DeepCool and MSI. This sort of thermal domination for $60 is unheard of!

While maximum performance is important, most of the time you won't be pushing the CPU to its limits. It's good to see how a cooler performs in more typical situations, and most users won't use more than 175W in common usage.

Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360 continues to perform excellently when limited to 175W, matching the performance of DeepCool and TeamGroup's competing products and outperforming MSI's S360 by a hair. With noise levels of 41.9 dBA, the cooler is audible but not loud - most users won't mind this noise level.

125W is the lowest level of power I test, and it's similar to what users will consume with this CPU in demanding games. While I've tested and show thermal results, they're really not a concern because even Intel's stock cooler will keep the CPU cool enough in a workload like this.

Noise levels, more than anything else, matter in a lighter load like this. At 38.2 dBA, Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360 matches the quietest competing AIOs I've tested for this review. This is a low noise level that shouldn't bother anyone.

Conclusion

Thermalright's Frozen Edge 360 provides thermal domination for only $60, with performance comparable to the best liquid coolers on the market. I'm honestly left wondering how Thermalright is able to price this product at such an affordable price. It is currently available on Amazon.com for only $58.90 as of this writing for the black version, and only $53.90 for the white model!

SAN RAMON, CA. / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2024 / Gridtractor, Monarch Tractor and Borg Warner successfully demonstrated Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities from a Monarch MK-V tractor through a Borg Warner 60 kW DC Fast Charger, orchestrated by Gridtractor's cloud-based charge management system using the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP).

The consortium team, funded by a $3 million California Energy Commission (CEC) grant to develop ""Vehicle to Building"" technology, demonstrated the first deployment of V2G capabilities from the 100% electric Monarch MK-V tractor at PG&E's Applied Technology Services (ATS) center in San Ramon, California.

The demonstration marks the completion of technology development for high-power export from the Monarch MK-V tractor and Gridtractor's open-standards charge management system, integrated with Borg Warner's 60 kW DC Fast Charger. Designed as a versatile 3-in-1 electrification tool, the MK-V functions as a tractor, utility vehicle, and a powerful electric generator, enabling high-capacity energy exports like this demonstration.

Once available, this integrated system will enable owners of the MK-V tractor to minimize charging costs and earn revenue by participating in a number of dynamic rate and demand response programs, in addition to existing fuel savings from EV operations. This will be facilitated using Gridtractor's energy market integrations and load scheduling applications.

The system will also facilitate ""automated load management"" - coordination of charging and discharging with other site loads to maximize the use of existing electrical services without exceeding their capacity - for irrigation pump sites, wineries and any facility convenient for charging. With flexible, scalable IoT and market integrations, and native OCPP-based architecture, the Gridtractor platform can connect any energy market or program with any Vehicle Grid Integration (VGI) application.

A variety of incentives and grants combined with bill savings from recently approved dynamic rates programs will enable agricultural customers to increase the already attractive ROI of electrifying MK-V tractor fleets while contributing to the reliability of the grid in their communities.

Spanish energy giant Iberdrola has this week unveiled plans to further beef up its renewables programme, confirming it plans to invest €41bn and hire 10,000 people by 2026 to accelerate electrification efforts across its portfolio.

The energy giant, which owns Scottish Power in the UK, yesterday released a revamped plan setting out how it intends to boost investment in a series of wind, solar, and grid projects across all its key markets.

Over a third of the investment is earmarked for the US, with just under a quarter planned for the UK, and 15 per cent set to be invested in projects across the Iberian Peninsula.

Over €21bn is to be invested in network projects, which the company regards as a major growth area, while €15.5bn is earmarked for selective renewables projects, and €1.5bn is to be used to ""reinforce a leadership position in energy storage"".

The company said the plans are expected to help it deliver an uptick in net profits to between $5.6bn and $5.8bn in 2026.

The investments should also put the company on track to deliver zero emissions from generation as early as 2030, while creating 10,000 new hires through to 2026.

Ignacio Galan, Iberdrola's executive chairman, said the investment plans were in line with a trend that was accelerating across the global energy industry.

""The electrification of energy is unstoppable and will expand exponentially in the years ahead, supporting decarbonisation, boosting energy security, and reducing the volatility caused by fossil fuels,"" he said. ""Customers are already driving this change. People are not returning to fossil fuels after they move to electric. Those who flip from petrol to EVs do not move back, likewise for customers replacing gas boilers with heat pumps.""

He added that the company's strategy would ""focus on delivering enhanced grid to support security of supply, now 60 per cent of our total investment, as well as a strong expansion of renewables capacity, driven by the substitution of fossil technologies and additional demand"".

""Our strategic pillars focus on networks, geographical diversification, and a balanced energy and customers mix,"" he said. ""This plan will allow us to grow our asset base, grow our profitability and strengthen our finances, as well as increasing dividends and driving jobs and skills and economic growth.""

The Dnepr Hydro Power Plant (HPP), a vital source of energy for Ukraine, has been severely damaged following a massive wave of Russian strikes, the head of the facility's operating company said on Friday.

The Dnepr HPP, located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. It was directly hit by two Russian missiles, the head of operator Ukrhydroenergo, Igor Sirota, claimed an interview with Radio Svoboda, a branch of the US-funded RFE/RL.

Zaporozhye Region voted to join Russia in the fall of 2022, although parts of the region are still held by Ukrainian troops.

The Ukrhydroenergo head offered a grim assessment of the situation at the Dnepr facility, saying ""we are losing the plant."" He added that the second unit of the plant had been hit, and that ""the support has been damaged... In other words, Dnepr HPP-2 is in critical condition, Dnepr HPP-1 is not operational either.""

Ukrhydroenergo is currently assessing the extent of the damage to the second unit, but a fire has complicated those efforts, Sirota added. It is clear at this point that the entire main generator hall and electrical equipment will need to be restored, he claimed, although he said there is no danger of a dam breach.

Sirota reported that no one was killed in the Russian strikes on the facility, although Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said there was one casualty.

A video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Russia missile moving toward the plant at high speed, before a powerful explosion rocks the facility.

Built in the early days of the Soviet Union during a period of large-scale industrialization, the Dnepr hydroelectric plant is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region and is a crucial source of energy for Kiev.

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched dozens of missiles and drones targeting the country's energy infrastructure in one of the most powerful barrages in weeks, causing widespread blackouts. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said several mines in Dnepropetrovsk Region and part of Kiev-controlled territory in Russia's Donetsk Region had been cut off from electricity.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities. ""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation. The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later. The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Areas across the wartorn country reported blackouts, including at least 200,000 in the western Khmelnytsky region and around 260,000 in the southern region of Odesa.

Russia said earlier it had launched a series of ""massive"" air strikes against Ukraine as retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on its border regions over recent weeks. It has targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war, now in its third year, in strikes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called ""energy terrorism.""

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Microsoft Mesh was released to Teams a while ago, and with it, the Redmond-based tech giant promised organizations a platform where they can host hybrid, but still very human interactions with the help of virtual 3D environments and the use of Teams avatars.

Mesh is somehow a quite useful platform: Microsoft has given developers the ability to work on customized environments, meaning the platform can be set up to support a variety of different settings.

From beaches to mountains to a virtual retreat near the lake, to a camp, even, where employees can take on their virtual avatars and hang out, professionally, and, Microsoft emphasizes, personally.

The platform is quite easy to set up, as well, and it can be done by accessing Teams. However, for a truly immersive experience, a VR set should be used to access these environments.

However, even then, something is off with Microsoft Mesh. We reported, earlier this year, that the platform feels like a Black Mirror episode: it offers a chance to hang out with other work colleagues and forge some sort of bonds, but in the long run, if it proves to be a success (most likely not), the Redmond-based tech giant might be adding ads to it.

Microsoft, on the other hand, says Mesh is helping its employees build connections and strengthen bonds within Mesh. In a blog post published recently, the Redmond-based tech giant says some employees think the whole experience of using Microsoft Mesh is magical and special, and that is due to the spatial audio capabilities of the platform, which makes other users feel as if they are near you.

Most employees agree that this is one of Mesh's biggest and most intriguing features. The immersive audio capabilities allow users to perceive sounds as they would in real life. For example, the effects of fading in and fading out appear when someone is distancing themselves from a Mesh group.

You'll get a visual notification on your screen, and you will notice the audio fade out and you can no longer hear those people that you were standing with. But now you can hear this other group that you've walked over to. This experience is more akin to being together physically.

Others agree:

Spatial audio is amazing. It really does feel like you're in the room by mimicking real audio behavior, and it helps capture nuances and non-verbal cues that don't always come through in standard online meetings but are so important for the group dynamic. Immersive spaces makes people confident, and that goes a long way toward building social connections.

Microsoft says the Mesh impressed even the most skeptical of testers:

Of course, it was a little unusual at first, because you're in a meeting room with people, but we're not actually in a meeting room. But it really did feel like we were in a space together. It's all just on Teams on the computer, yet it gives you that sense of social connection. It's more casual. More intimate. And that opens us up to more collaboration and connection, and that engagement enhances any kind of remote or hybrid team experience.

However, is it? Is it indeed more casual? Or intimate? According to statistics from Exploding Topics, Metaverse, another immersive virtual space platform, has over 400 million users, so you say the platform is popular. But, over 80% of these users are younger than 16.

So that means that the current generations currently active in the working field: Gen Z, which are now around 20, and older, or Millenials, who are approaching their 40s, are not currently interested in virtual spaces.

Microsoft might mean well, and I really think it does, but for now, Microsoft Mesh seems too early, and way too soon. The recent pandemic changed the whole work dynamic, and hybrid jobs, or remote jobs are becoming more and more popular among the workforce: this means people don't really want to get personal when it comes to work.

But even if they would want to, a physical and real interaction would still be preferable, to hanging out in a virtual space.",windowsreport.com,news,Windows Report | Error-free Tech Life,,0.4745098039215687,448809363,1,https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/400-million-2024-03-22T114545.746.jpg,

Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes achieved a higher time in range and had fewer complications with use of a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system compared with continuous glucose monitoring alone, according to a speaker.

As Healio previously reported in the AiDAPT study, pregnant women with type 1 diabetes who used the CamAPS FX (CamDiab) hybrid closed-loop system had a greater increase in time in range than women receiving multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy plus a CGM. Helen R. Murphy, MB, BCh, BAO, MD, FRACP, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia and honorary consultant physician at Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust in the U.K., said pregnant women with type 1 diabetes can benefit from the use of hybrid closed-loop therapy, but not all hybrid closed-loop systems may be able to improve glycemic control.

""Hybrid closed-loop, but not just any hybrid closed-loop, specifically only CamAPS FX, should be offered to all women before or during type 1 diabetes pregnancy,"" Murphy said during a presentation at the International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes.

The risks for complications that women with type 1 diabetes face during pregnancy are strongly associated their HbA1c level in the first trimester. Data from the National Pregnancy in Diabetes Audit conducted in the U.K. in 2021 and 2022 confirm that women with a higher HbA1c during the first trimester had greater risks for complications such as stillbirth or a serious heart or birth defect.

""If we want to improve pregnancy outcomes across a population, then it is vitally important that we do not just target those who have more optimal glycemic control, we need technologies that can be appliable across a whole population and across all of the maternal glucose categories,"" Murphy said.

CGM use is embedded in routine clinical care among pregnant women with type 1 diabetes in the U.K. According to the National Diabetes Audit, 95% of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes used a CGM in 2022. In data from the National Pregnancy in Diabetes Audit reported in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology in 2024, pregnant women who used CGM had improved glucose levels as well as fewer large for gestational age babies, preterm births and neonatal care admissions than women who did not use CGM. Rates of serious adverse pregnancy outcomes such as birth defects, stillbirth and baby deaths were lower among CGM users compared with women not using CGM.

The findings were extremely encouraging, Murphy said, but previous studies have shown that even with CGM use pregnant women with type 1 diabetes struggle to achieve the tight time in range of 63 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL that is recommended during pregnancy, adding that said several factors make glycemic control during pregnancy more difficult.

""During pregnancy, you have changes in insulin sensitivity, you have rising post-meal insulin resistance, we have week-by-week changes, we have day-to-day changes in variability of insulin pharmacokinetics, we have the real fear of hyperglycemia and the consequences it has on the baby, and the huge burden of self-management for women with type 1 diabetes,"" Murphy said.

A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2023 showed that hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery could be the solution for boosting time in range among pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. The AiDAPT trial enrolled 124 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes who were receiving intensive insulin therapy and had an HbA1c of 6.5% to 10% at baseline. Women were randomly assigned to use a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system consisting of the CamAPS FX smartphone app, the Dana Diabecare RS insulin pump (Sooil) and the Dexcom G6 CGM or a standard care group that used a CGM and received multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. The standard care group had all insulin dosing adjustments made by their care team. Time in range of 63 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL from 16 weeks gestation to delivery was the study's primary endpoint.

Women in the hybrid closed-loop therapy group had an increase in time in range from 48% at baseline to 68% during the trial, whereas the standard care group had a mean time in range increase from 45% at baseline to 56% during the trial. The closed-loop group had a greater increase in time in range compared with the standard care group (adjusted mean difference, 10.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 7-14; P < .001). Murphy said hybrid-closed-loop therapy was associated with a higher time in range at all times of the day, with the greatest difference seen in the early morning hours. The time in range increase was consistent regardless of maternal age, baseline HbA1c and insulin therapy at baseline.

Women receiving hybrid closed-loop therapy also had fewer hypertensive disorders and lower maternal weight gain than those receiving standard care.

Findings from the AiDAPT trial support the use of the CamAPS FX hybrid closed-loop system. However, a more recent study published in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics in February showed that other hybrid closed-loop systems may not provide the same benefit. The study assessed 124 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, including 59 who used a commercial hybrid closed-loop system off-label in Spain. Of participants, approximately 80% used the Medtronic 780G, 10% used the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ and 10% used a Diabeloop hybrid closed-loop system. Of the participants with an early pregnancy HbA1c of more than 6.5%, only 5% achieved a time in range of at least 70%, with maternal gestational weight gain of up to 5.4 kg during pregnancy, and 69% had a large for gestational age infant.

During a Q&A session, Murphy said the reason for the difference in performance between the CamAPS FX system in the AiDAPT trial and the commercially available off-label systems was that the CamAPS algorithm had been adjusted for pregnant women, with lower glucose targets and a uniquely adaptive algorithm based on 15 years of testing and feedback from providers and patients.

""We waited to do the [AiDAPT] trial until we had sensors, pumps and algorithms that were suitable for widespread use across a type 1 diabetes pregnant population,"" Murphy said. ""It took time, and the sweet spot was there, the algorithm was good enough and the sensors were good enough.""",healio.com,news,Healio,,0.2705882352941176,448808702,1,https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/endocrinology/misc/infographics/2024/03_march/et0324murphy_attd_graphic_01_web.jpg,

President Volodymyr Zlenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

We determine the CP-dependent RI in the optically absorbing spectral range of the two enantiomers and compare how they behave differently for LCP and RCP light. Importantly, we show that thin film-based CD measurements largely underestimate the intrinsic chiroptical behavior, likely due to domain variations, poor crystallinity, and defects. The measurements agree with our first-principles calculations based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach within many-body perturbation theory. The calculations reveal that the observed exciton band-edge CD arises from excitons residing primarily in the inorganic sublattice and is driven by a purely quantum mechanical electron-hole exchange interaction, which lifts the degeneracy of degenerate bright exciton states arising from transitions between the Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD)-split bands. Our approaches can be generalized to accurately characterize and engineer the chiroptical properties of other extended systems employing chiral ligands.

The optical and scanning electron micrographs, and the X-ray diffraction pattern (Supplementary Fig. 1), reveal the high quality of centimeter-sized single crystals exhibiting optically smooth a-b facets parallel to the lead-bromide layers, allowing us to access the intrinsic optical properties of these materials. The optical measurements were performed with light perpendicularly incident on the a-b plane of the crystals. Since S/R-NPB with a layered structure has drastically different optical responses along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, the wave vector of light used throughout our measurements dictates that the optical properties discussed here are exclusively in-plane. Supplementary Fig. 2 depicts the experimental setup developed for the work, with samples measured in reflection (see Methods for experimental details). A photoelastic modulator (PEM) was used to periodically alternate the incident light between LCP and RCP at the PEM's fundamental frequency of ~50 kHz, which we denote as the frequency.

Before addressing the CP-dependent RI, we first work out the RI under unpolarized light by combining micro-reflectance spectroscopy and a dielectric coating-based method. As a model-blind approach that does not require parametric fitting, the method involves two separate reflectivity measurements: the first measurement is on a pristine perovskite crystal, and the second is on a perovskite crystal coated with a thin dielectric layer (with known thickness and RI). As reflectivity depends on the perovskite's and , using the two measured reflectivity values as independent input parameters, the perovskite's complex RI (i.e., both and ) can be determined without invoking any fitting parameters (see Supplementary Note 1 for details). The reflection-based method is particularly suited for the spectral range where the material is a strong light absorber, as light is completely terminated within the crystal with absence of backside reflection off of the crystal. For this reason, the long wavelength limit of this work is ~402 nm, dictated by the material bandgap. The short wavelength is cut off at 365 nm, determined by the available light source in this work. As discussed below, the 365 ~ 402 nm range completely covers the exciton resonance of S/R-NPB.

The dielectric coating we adopted is a thin AlO layer grown by electron-beam evaporation. The RI and thickness ( ~ 17 nm) of AlO are determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (Supplementary Fig. 3). The perovskite's RI is then determined wavelength-by-wavelength. For instance, Fig. 1a, b demonstrate how the RI is determined for 386 nm. Using the transfer-matrix method or Fresnel's law of reflection (Supplementary Note 1), we first search for combinations of perovskite's and that are necessary to yield experimental reflectivity (15.3%) at this wavelength; these combinations are shown as a contour in Fig. 1a. We then determine what combinations of and must also be true, such that the AlO/perovskite stack reproduces the measured reflectivity (5.1%); these combinations appear as another contour in Fig. 1b. The intersection of these two contours uniquely determines the true and at 386 nm.

Figure 1c presents the reflectance spectra of S-NPB and R-NPB single crystals, measured with unpolarized light, both before and after coating by AlO. By executing the procedure outlined above, we determine the wavelength-dependent and for the two enantiomers from 365 to 402 nm (Fig. 1d). The slight difference between the two enantiomers likely arises from sample-quality variations and experimental errors, as we do not anticipate the two enantiomers to differ under unpolarized light. Notably, Fig. 1d reveals an absorption centered at 387 nm, which corresponds to the exciton resonance of S/R-NPB and is on par with exciton wavelengths of other lead-bromide perovskites ( denotes the number of octahedral layers per repeating unit along the c axis). Compared to (BA)PbI, an lead-iodide perovskite where BA = CH(CH)NH, the peak value of for S/R-NPB at the exciton resonance is lower (i.e., for S/R-NPB versus for (BA)PbI), which we attribute to the larger out-of-plane lattice constant of S/R-NPB that in turn reduces the exciton oscillator strength. The weaker exciton resonance is also manifested as a weaker exciton-induced reflectivity peak ( < 20%; Fig. 1c, before AlO coating) compared to that of (BA)PbI (>30%).

The and in Fig. 1d represent the response of S/R-NPB evenly averaged between LCP and RCP light with random phase delays. Equivalently, the reflectivity in Fig. 1c is equal to , where and are the reflectivity for LCP light and RCP light, respectively. More information is still needed to determine the relative amplitude of and , and with them the CP-dependent RIs. As discussed in Supplementary Note 2, the ratio of and is derived to be

(the sign """" takes """" if , and """" if ), where and represent the intensities of reflected light modulated at the frequency and the chopper frequency, respectively. Therefore, since is already known, measuring the ratio will permit the quantification of and individually. Figure 2a presents the measured for S-NPB and R-NPB crystals, both before and after coating with AlO. In addition to the amplitudes, we find that the signal for R-NPB and S-NPB exhibit phases offset by 180° on the lock-in amplifier, and the same phase offset persists throughout the 365 ~ 402 nm range, independent of the coating of AlO. Such a persistent phase difference arises from the opposite ranking of and between R-NPB and S-NPB over the explored spectral range: for S-NPB, we find (as depicted in Fig. 2b). It is important to note handedness inversion for CP light upon reflection (Supplementary Note 2), as illustrated in Fig. 2b. Note that we did not observe noticeable lock-in voltage at the frequency for racemic-NPB crystals, suggesting its lack of CD response.

Combining and , we can now determine the wavelength-dependent and individually, both before and after coating with AlO. These reflectivity values (specifically, four values at each wavelength for each enantiomer) finally permit extraction of the CP-dependent and for the two enantiomers. The complex RIs for S-NPB, including , , and (the second subscript, R or L, indicates RCP or LCP, respectively), are plotted in Fig. 2c. These data then permit the calculation of differences in the and between LCP and RCP for S-NPB (Fig. 2d). The results for R-NPB are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4. Overall, the two enantiomers exhibit opposing chiroptical behaviors, i.e., RCP light and LCP light for R-NPB are respectively as LCP light and RCP light for S-NPB. The slight differences in the amplitudes of and between the two enantiomers (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4b) are likely not intrinsic but arise from experimental errors and sample-to-sample variations.

Using the extracted and , we can further calculate the real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity through and , respectively. These results, and their differences between LCP and RCP, are presented in Fig. 2e, f (Supplementary Figs. 4c, d) for S-NPB (R-NPB). The results for S-NPB (Fig. 2c-f) distill the following observations. Firstly, the shapes of and , and their relative amplitudes between LCP and RCP (Fig. 2e), resemble those seen in and (Fig. 2c). Secondly, the curve exhibits a derivative-like lineshape (Fig. 2d), whose zero-crossing wavelength matches the exciton peak (Fig. 1d); such a derivative-like lineshape indicates a spectral blueshift of as light is switched from LCP to RCP (Fig. 2c) associated with CD. Thirdly, a negative dip is present in the spectra of and ; these dips reside on a dispersion-less negative background. Last but not least, a circular birefringence (CB), signified by , is observed, which is on the order of 0.02-0.04. Notably, this exciton resonance-enhanced CB is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of, e.g., quartz, a prototypical circularly birefringent material, whose at 589 nm. The CD represented by has a magnitude of 0.02-0.04, which is comparable to the CB.

Using the Kramers-Kronig (K-K) relationship, the change in caused by a change in can be calculated as

with denoting the principal value of the integral. The contribution to from obtained from the K-K analysis is shown in Fig. 2f as the blue-dashed line. Notably, the K-K analysis quantitatively captures the dip observed in the spectrum, leaving behind a nearly constant, negative residual of approximately -0.1, indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2f. Equivalently, is a superposition of (associated with , i.e., the CD effect) and a dispersion-less, negative shift of when going from LCP to RCP; the latter, negative component of indicates that for S-NPB. We assign this dispersion-less behavior of to the CB effect, which is complementary, and of similar magnitude, to the CD. The CB of S-NPB is consistent in sign with laevo-rotatory S-(-)-NEA molecules: they both exhibit or, equivalently, , hence they both rotate the polarization of linearly polarized light counter-clockwise when viewed towards the light source. In contrast, R-NPB crystals exhibit an opposing behavior, i.e., (Supplementary Fig. 4d), in line with the dextrorotatory response of R-( + )-NEA molecules.

Molar concentration-dependent polarimetry experiments on R-NEA and S-NEA molecules (Supplementary Fig. 5) show that in the solution phase, the optical rotation power is ±1.15 degrees cm ( for R-NEA; for S-NEA) at a concentration of 1 mol L, translating to an amplitude of or for the chiral molecules (noting for NEA at 589 nm). Based on the crystal structure of S/R-NPB, the equivalent molar concentration of NEA cations in S/R-NPB crystals is 4.9 mol L. Interestingly, the CB exhibited by the perovskite solid is four orders of magnitude larger than that obtained by scaling the of S/R-NEA molecules to a concentration of 4.9 mol L, suggesting the important role of the lead-bromide framework in the observed large CB effect.

We then turn to theory to better understand the role of the lead-bromide framework in the large CD. We start by relaxing the experimental structure from literature within density functional theory (DFT). We use the DFT ground-state calculated within the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhoff (PBE) as a starting point for a one-shot GW calculation to obtain the quasiparticle bandgap, followed by a GW-BSE calculation to obtain exciton eigenstates. We then use Fermi's golden rule to calculate the contribution of the transition rate between the ground state and the exciton states to the associated with absorption of LCP and RCP light. The resulting spectra are shifted by 0.25 eV to compensate for underestimation of the bandgap resulting from the PBE ground-state, consistent with previous work. Note that perturbations due to the electric dipole alone are not sufficient to describe CD, which also includes contributions from the magnetic dipole and, potentially, the electric quadrupole. In our calculations, we included contributions from the electric dipole and the orbital component of magnetic dipole, which we find sufficient to understand the key features of the experimental results. Further computational details are in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. 6-8.

Figure 3a shows the theoretically calculated (and obtained from the K-K relation) overlaid on the experimental curves, and Fig. 3b shows and between LCP and RCP, all for S-NBP. With a constant broadening of 46 meV, the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experimental spectral features, including the derivative-like lineshape and sign changes in the spectrum. The binding energy of the lowest energy bright exciton of 0.46 eV is consistent with previously reported exciton binding energies in layered perovskites. Importantly, we find that the lowest energy peak in consists of two distinct bright exciton resonances that are split by 17 meV. The lower-energy state is bright when the light is polarized along the to direction, whereas the higher-energy state is bright when the light is polarized along the to direction (see Supplementary Fig. 7). Both states are bright under excitation with circularly polarized light. These two bright excitons are composed primarily of electrons in the two lowest conduction bands and holes in the two highest valence bands (see Supplementary Fig. 8f). Atomic-orbital-resolved band structures (Fig. 3c) and spin-resolved band structures (Fig. 3d) reveal that the highest valence bands and lowest conduction bands are RD-split states resulting from the Pb-Br octahedral tilting coupled with the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Pb.

In an independent-particle picture, we would expect such states to give rise to two degenerate band-to-band transitions, one of which is allowed for RCP, and the other allowed for LCP due to selection rules imposed by the spin texture. Due to the degeneracy of these two sets of transitions, contrary to previous hypotheses that the RD splitting alone is responsible for chirality transfer between sublattices, we would not expect to observe CD (though CPL is still possible). However, the degeneracy of these transitions is broken after accounting for strong exciton effects in 2D perovskites. As established in previous work, the undistorted layered perovskite has two degenerate low-energy spin-allowed exciton states that are bright under excitation with in-plane-polarized light. The octahedral tilting breaks the degeneracy of these bright excitons, and the two states exhibit a linear dichroism with one state being coupled to light polarized along X direction and the other being coupled to light polarized along the Y direction. In the absence of exchange interactions, these bright spin-allowed states are degenerate with their spin-forbidden counterparts, and the states themselves are nearly degenerate with a small crystal-field splitting of ~1 meV. However, this near degeneracy is lifted by electron-hole exchange interaction, which splits the two sets of bright and dark states by different amounts, resulting in a ~ 17 meV splitting of the two bright states (Supplementary Note 3). This splitting of the bright states, which couple dissimilarly to RCP and LCP light, gives rise to a pronounced derivative-like line-shape in the spectrum, reminiscent of the Cotton effect. In the absence of exchange, the excitonic states are nearly degenerate and the CD coming from band-edge excitons vanishes (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, the large chirality transfer from chiral spacers to lead-bromide sublattice, and the observed Cotton effect, are quantum phenomena driven by the different exchange-scattering of the bright excitons, which is in turn related to the crystal-field splitting.

Back to the experimental results, having the RI data (Fig. 2c), we can calculate the transmittance of RCP and LCP light for an S-NPB single-crystalline slab with thickness varied within 2-160 nm. Figure 4a shows the calculated transmittance averaged for LCP and RCP light with the exciton absorption centered at 387 nm. With the CP-dependent RI, we can further calculate the ellipticity of light exiting the sample as

where () and () are the field strength and intensity of transmitted RCP (LCP) light, respectively. The map of (Fig. 4b) exhibits a derivative-like line-shape with a zero-crossing wavelength overlapping with the exciton peak, resembling the characteristic Cotton effect. Notably, large values of over ± 1 degree can be achieved for films thicker than ~100 nm; these large values of occur near, but not exactly at, the exciton absorption peak. Similar results calculated for R-NPB are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.

We can further define an ellipticity measured in reflectance by using and to replace and in Eq. (4), i.e.,

The one-to-one correspondence between and indicates that can be directly calculated using . As shown in Fig. 4c, large values of in reflectance can be achieved, although not as high as that in transmittance, which arises from a shorter optical interaction length in reflection (Supplementary Fig. 10). The sign of in reflectance is opposite to that in transmittance, consistent with the CP inversion upon reflection. Lowering the temperature can lead to enhancement in (Supplementary Fig. 11) and a more significant difference between and . Resultingly, a large magnitude of approaching -2° can be achieved at 50 K near the exciton resonance (Fig. 4d).

We then compare our results for single crystals to that of thin films, since films have been the predominant sample type for CD characterization. While the literature does not always report the film thickness together with CD spectra, it is reasonable to assume the thickness to be larger than 100 nanometers. Compared to reported thin-film CD spectra, whose magnitude typically resides in the tens-of-milli-degree range, the CD based on single-crystal results shown in Fig. 4 is 1 ~ 2 orders of magnitude stronger. Such a large discrepancy observed between film- and single crystal-chiral MHPs leads us to hypothesize that the chiroptical properties of spin-coated films may be strongly impacted by grains, grain boundaries, defects, and amorphous domains due to suboptimal crystallization. To test this hypothesis, we fabricated S-NPB and R-NPB films using literature-reported procedures. Notably, the X-ray diffraction data for the annealed, crystalline film (Supplementary Fig. 12) lacks the high-index out-of-plane peaks exhibited by crystals (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggesting a loss of long-range order. The annealed films are examined by cross-sectional scanning-electron microscopy and traditional CD transmittance experiments (Supplementary Figs. 13a, b), demonstrating a lower ellipticity by approximately an order of magnitude when compared to the predicted single-crystal values. CD reflectance experiments on these films using our setup yielded consistently lower and ellipticity measured in reflectance (Fig. 4e, f for S-NPB and Supplementary Fig. 13c, d for R-NPB) in comparison to single crystals (Figs. 2a and 4d). Note that, as illustrated in Fig. 4e, we find the film to be highly nonuniform and its value varies from spot to spot.

Indeed, it has been found that chiral spacers can strongly disrupt crystallization of 2D-MHPs and facilitate the stabilization of amorphous phase of S/R-NPB. We hence hypothesize the seemingly crystalline S-NPB films with out-of-plane alignment on the substrate host sizeable fractions of non-crystalline regions. Additional synchrotron X-ray diffraction data (Supplementary Fig. 14) illustrates a strong contrast in the crystallinity between single crystals and annealed films. Combining our experimental and theoretical results, we finally rationalize the following three possible reasons behind the observed lower CD for annealed films compared to single crystals.

Firstly, the non-crystallized domains in the film sample do not contribute to the CD near the exciton resonance, since the amorphous and crystalline phases have spectrally isolated exciton resonances (Supplementary Fig. 12c). In addition, our ab initio theory suggests that the selection rules imposed by the spin texture and RD splitting underpin the large CD around the exciton resonance. As such, the Cotton effect is sensitive to the energy splitting of the two exciton states, which is in turn sensitive to the crystal structure. In conjunction with the first point, we anticipate that lowered crystallinity, high-density grain boundaries (e.g., those between domains of randomly distributed in-plane orientations), and defects can significantly relax the selection rules, thereby reducing the CD of the films. Lastly, the synchrotron X-ray diffraction data (Supplementary Fig. 14) further reveals that the annealed film has a slightly different lattice constant ( ~ 0.4% contraction) along the c direction (i.e., perpendicular to the 2D perovskite layers) from that of single crystals. This may lead to lower amount of octahedral tilting distortion, and with it weaker chiroptical effects.

In summary, using CP-resolved micro-reflectance spectroscopy, we determine the intrinsic, CP-distinguished refractive indices and relative permittivities of S/R-NPB. The chiroptical behavior consists of a CP-dependent spectral shift of exciton absorption and a dispersion-less CB in line with the optical activity of the chiral organic cations. The CD increases with decreasing temperature and approaches or exceeds unity degree in θ defined for transmittance or reflectance. Importantly, bulk crystals exhibit much larger CD response than films, which we attribute to imperfections and incomplete crystallization of the latter. Theoretical calculations show that the Cotton effect seen in the CD spectrum and enhanced CD at the band edge are excitonic effects driven by an electron-hole exchange interaction involving RD-split states at the band edge, suggesting new pathways for tuning the CD response through the exciton binding energy, the magnitude of the exchange, and the degree of inversion symmetry-breaking. Our work offers insights on chiral matter-light interactions towards enhanced chiroptical control of light emission and detection. The intrinsic CD characteristics and the concomitant theoretical understanding can be valuable for evaluating and controlling the degree of spin-splitting in the growing chiral MHP family with 2D and lower dimensionalities for luminescence, photodetection, and spintronic applications.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.06666666666666665,448807565,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46851-2/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46851_Fig1_HTML.png,

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defense industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defense systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) emerges as a key player in the renewable energy landscape, poised for significant growth and impact. In this piece, we'll delve into why this turbine giant deserves a closer look and why it might be a promising addition to your investment portfolio.

In recent years, the renewable energy sector has witnessed both triumphs and trials. While solar energy experienced positive growth, the wind energy sector grappled with various challenges. Rising costs for materials, labor, and capital, coupled with delays in project execution, posed significant hurdles for wind energy projects.

However, amidst the mentioned challenges, the sector found solace in the form of new clean energy and climate legislation, which injected fresh momentum into the supply chain.

Federal investments in clean energy, coupled with mounting pressure from both public and private sectors to decarbonize, serve as driving forces propelling renewables forward. These factors not only pave the way for overcoming existing obstacles but also play a pivotal role in meeting ambitious climate targets set forth by organizations like Deloitte.

According to projections by the Energy Information Administration, renewable deployment is expected to witness a significant uptick in 2024, with a forecasted growth of 17%, reaching 42 gigawatts. This surge is anticipated to account for nearly a quarter of electricity generation.

What's more, investments in clean energy technology are on the rise, with projections nearing $800 billion in 2024. Solar energy is expected to lead the pack, commanding the largest share of investment, followed closely by onshore wind.

Despite challenges from rising costs in sectors like offshore wind and hydrogen energy, decreasing raw material prices provide a silver lining. This trend is anticipated to drive down the average cost of clean energy technologies further.

Key points to note include:

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) stands tall as a prominent producer and distributor of electricity across the United States.

With operations spanning five key segments -- Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions -- the company boasts an impressive portfolio comprising over 32,000 megawatts of generating capacity. This capacity is derived from a diverse array of assets including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric sources.

On November 6, Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) reported robust quarterly and full-year financial results, surpassing market expectations.

Despite fluctuations in investor sentiment, the company continues to garner interest from prominent investors. Notably, William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management emerged as the largest shareholder, holding 6.15 million shares valued at $718.88 million.

With a robust portfolio of renewable energy assets and a track record of financial resilience, Constellation Energy Corporation presents a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking to ride the winds of change in the renewable energy landscape. As the global commitment to decarbonization gains momentum, the company appears poised to soar to new heights, fueled by a strong tailwind into the future.

The 2020s played host to the era of the smart guitar, with innovations such as Lava Music's effects-loaded offerings - and the ever-growing interconnectivity between guitars and gadgets - pushing us towards a gear future characterized by technologically advanced instruments.

As such, it was only a matter of time before Harley Benton, the champion of cheap guitar gear, threw its hat in the ring and started rubbing shoulders with the tech giants of the guitar world - and that time has now arrived.

Enter the TravelMate-E - an all-new space age acoustic electric guitar unlike anything Harley Benton has released before, which serves as the brand's most radical release yet.

That much is clear from the outset, as an appraisal of the aesthetics will show. The guitar boasts a single-cut carbon fiber build, which accommodates both a side-mounted soundhole and a quirky, flame-esque soundhole below the strings.

At its core, the stealthy space age six-string features a thinline body, an arched back and fingerboard for ""comfort and playability"", DLX die-cast tuners, a carbon fiber nut and 20 frets.

Said to ""redefine what it means to take music on the road"", the $270 TravelMate-E also looks poised to become one of the cheapest 'smart' guitars on the market, with fully fledged app connectivity allowing players to utilize the brand's new onboard ""SP1 Smart Speaker"".

That system offers reverb and modulation effects, and works alongside the app to navigate ""a wide range of tones and effects directly from your instrument"", according to Harley Benton.

It's worth noting the app itself is offered by Enya - an existing company that specializes in smart guitars, and already has a range of all-in-one instruments to its name.

In fact, it is the Enya logo that the main soundhole has been fashioned to represent, making the TravelMate-E something of a collaborative creation.

Elsewhere, the TravelMate-E also offers Bluetooth connectivity, and a USB jack for digital output and charging.

With all that said, the TravelMate-E looks to be a strong, affordable entry into the tech game from Harley Benton, which is clearly keen on catching up with the more established smart guitar brands out there.

Granted, pricier alternatives (such as the Lava Music Lava Me 3) are more advanced, and have touchscreens built into the guitar, as well as apps for learning, looping, practicing, recording and more.

At $270 though, the app-only approach seems wholly justified, and the TravelMate-E looks to be a neat gateway guitar for those who may be looking to see what all the fuss is about.

Harley Benton is also keen to sell the aptly named TravelMate-E as a commendable travel guitar. It says the model ""may just be the perfect guitar for portability and versatility"", citing its light weight, compact size and durability to support its point.

For those who like the look of the futuristic design but aren't sold by the digital enhancements, Harley Benton has also released the standard TravelMate. This variant is built the same, though doesn't incorporate the Smart Pickup System.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least five people, officials said Friday.

President Volodymyr Zlenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country.

It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

President Volodymyr Zlenskyy said more than 60 drones and about 90 rockets were used in the attack.

The attack came a day after Russia launched 31 missiles in a single attack on the capital. It was the largest assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year and one of the largest since the outbreak of the war, according to Ukrainian authorities.

""Even last winter, attacks on our energy system were not as large as they were this night,"" said the head of energy utility Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.

Last winter, Russia deliberately targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, resulting in frequent blackouts across the country. Many had warned that Russia might repeat this strategy ahead of this winter. But instead, Russia has launched massive missile and drone attacks primarily directed at Ukraine's defence industry.

Every large-scale air attack depletes Ukraine's capabilities to repel Russian missiles. Zelenskyy has been urging Ukraine's Western allies for weeks to provide additional air defence systems and ammunition amid delays in aid from the U.S.

""With Russian missiles, there are no delays, like with aid packages to our state. Shaheds don't have indecisiveness, as do some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Iranian-made Shahed drones, which are widely used by Russia in the war.

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

Th""e main external power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday, but Ukraine's nuclear energy operator said it was restored several hours later.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Three people were killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts in the country's second-largest city and disrupted critical air-raid siren systems. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said police would inform residents of possible air raids through loudspeakers and walkie-talkies and that alerts would be sent to cellular phones.

Other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

The power outages left 1,060 miners trapped in the Dnipropetrovsk region and an evacuation was underway, according to private energy company DTEK.

The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

The station was seriously damaged as two of the missiles struck the HPP directly. At the same time, there is no threat of a dam failure.

The second hydroelectric power station at Dnipro HPP was seriously damaged, Igor Sirota, director of Ukrhydroenergo that operates the station said.

According to him, two missiles hit HPP-1 and HPP-2 units of the station directly.

The Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant (DneproGES) is the fifth stage of the Dnieper cascade of hydroelectric power stations. It is located in the Zaporozhye region on the Dnieper River in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporozhye (also spelled as Zaporizhzhia).

The region, together with the Kherson region, DPR and LPR, became part of Russia in the fall of 2022 following the referenda that were held there.

The first stage of the hydroelectric power station was built back in 1927-1932. HPP-1 and HPP-2 form one single complex, which is located under one dam. The hydroelectric power station building is 236 meters long and 70 meters wide. The installed capacity of the hydraulic units is 1553.8 MW.

HPP-1 and HPP-2 units came out of order as a GES-2 is under threat. We don't know at what capacity it will be able to operate. HPP-2 is in critical condition. HPP-1 is not working either, so we are doing everything to raise the valves and process the water, because, alas, we will not be able to process this water through the station,"" Sirota said.

The broader markets are especially raising concerns relating to elevated valuations. Market regulator SEBI's push to mutual funds towards declaring stress test results on their holdings is also keeping investors on tenterhooks. With elections also set to commence from next month till June first week, markets may continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future.

In this regard, hybrid funds may be suitable for investors, especially as this category lends itself to lump-sum investing as investment timing becomes less relevant due to the fund manager's shuffling of the portfolio based on specific market conditions. Equity Savings funds are hybrid schemes that invest in a blend of equity and related instruments, debt and derivatives. As equity investments - that are usually hedged in this case - need to account for at least 65 per cent of the portfolio, these funds enjoy equity taxation.

Mahindra Manulife Equity Savings Fund is a quality performer in the category and has delivered returns consistently since its inception in February 2017. With above-average, double-digit returns over the years, the fund can be a good diversifier for a conservative investor's portfolio, especially in the current environment. Investors can consider parking lump-sums in the fund with a three-five year perspective. Those without lump-sums to spare can consider SIPs.

Delivering reliably

The fund has been consistent in being among the best in its category. On a point-to-point basis, Mahindra Manulife Equity Savings has delivered more than 12 per cent over the medium to long term. In the last one year, it has given in excess of 20 per cent.

When three-year rolling returns are taken from February 2017 to March 2024, the fund has delivered a mean of 11.5 per cent, higher than most peers.

If three-year rolling returns are taken over the above-mentioned period, the fund has given more than 10 per cent returns nearly 74 per cent of the time. With the same timeframe and rolling period criteria, Mahindra Manulife Equity Savings has delivered more than 12 per cent over 60 per cent of the time.

When SIP returns (XIRR) are considered for the past seven years, the scheme has given 12.3 per cent.

Clearly, the fund has been quite consistent over the past seven-odd years.

Deft portfolio moves

Mahindra Manulife Equity Savings invests in a blend of equities, bonds and derivatives.

The equity portion of the portfolio is generally kept 65 per cent or a bit more. For most part, the stocks are large-caps from the Nifty 100 basket. These large-caps account for over 80 per cent of the equity holdings across most market conditions, with mid- and small-caps making up for the remaining part. Financial services dominate the equity holdings across cycles. The other holdings are shuffled around a bit based in market conditions. For example, the IT sector was among the top holdings in early 2022, but has been trimmed subsequently as the segment faces business headwinds. Construction materials stocks have seen stakes being hiked in the last couple of years as the economy went into healthy growth mode. Surprisingly, the fund has FMCG among its key holdings in its recent portfolio even as weak rural volume growth has seen the sector underperform.

In the debt portion, corporate bonds form a key part and the holdings are restricted to AAA-rated securities, with a few AA-rated ones as well in the case of reputed conglomerates. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) also find a small space within the portfolio. Government bonds and treasury bills are other key fixed-income holdings for the fund. The scheme takes no credit risk in its debt portion.

Mahindra Manulife Equity Savings also takes derivative positions to the tune of 20-30 per cent of the assets. This helps keep a good part of the equity portion hedged and also opens the possibility of accruals to the portfolio via pay-offs.

For conservative investors, this fund can be a part of their satellite portfolio as a diversifier. A lump-sum investment with a time horizon of five years can be rewarding for investors. The equity taxation for such funds ensures that the risk-adjusted returns are healthy as any gains higher than ₹1 lakh made on a holding period of more than one year are taxed at 10 per cent.

This news has sent shockwaves through the international community.

Social media feeds are flooded with video clips showing the precise moment of the missile's impact. Based on information from Russian sources, the missile used in the attack on the hydroelectric power plant appears to be the Kh-101 cruise missile. Intriguingly, the missile jettisons submunitions thrice before its final impact, often deployed against ground-based air defense systems.

What's perplexing is the apparent lack of an interceptor's trace from the ground. This raises urgent inquiries about the apparent shortfall in Ukraine's defense of the Dnieper HPP. There is, however, a possibility that despite being activated, the air defenses failed to intercept this specific missile.

Released images

Ukrainian sources have released post-strike images that unveil the extent of the damage. Judging by the immediate reports, the missile hit with highly accurate precision, annihilating the hydroelectric engines. This severe damage indicates the Dnipro HPP - the largest in Ukraine - is now essentially non-functional.

Anatoly Kurtev, Secretary of the Zaporizhia City Council, delivered a distressing report: two residential houses in Zaporizhia have been leveled by the missile strike, and seven others partially destroyed. Overall, the city has seen damage to over 150 structures, including both private homes and multi-story buildings. Additional casualty reports from the Head of the Zaporizhzhia OVA, Ivan Fedorov, state that one person has tragically lost their life, and another eight have been injured.

DTEK also under attack

The DTEK thermal power plant was on the receiving end of missile attacks, with the resulting damage to the equipment being extensive. ""In one night alone, over 60 Shaheds and nearly 90 missiles of varying kinds were launched. The objective of these Russian terrorists is starkly evident for the world to see: they target power plants, power lines, hydroelectric dams, ordinary houses, and even a public transport bus. Russia is bearing down on the everyday life of the people. Our hearts go out to the kin and loved ones of those who fell victim to this reign of terror,"" shared Zelensky.

According to statements from Ukrainian authorities, the interception of 35 Kh-101 cruise missiles was successful. The Ukrainian Air Defense also neutralized 55 Shahed [Geran-2] suicide drones and a pair of Kh-59 missiles. Still, these claims seem inconsistent when compared with the videos surfacing from virtually every region where a missile was directed.

Kh-101

The Kh-101, a Russian air-launched cruise missile developed by the Raduga Design Bureau, is a strategic weapon known for its stealth capabilities and precision. Among its notable features are its ability to evade radar systems and its incorporation of a special composite material that absorbs radio waves, enhancing its stealth capabilities even further.

Driven by a turbofan engine the Kh-101 can cruise at subsonic speeds. Its flight altitude capacity extends up to 10,000 meters, and it can operate at low altitudes to skirt detection.

What sets the Kh-101 apart is its array of guidance systems - it uses an inertial navigation system for initial guidance and a satellite navigation system for mid-course guidance. Terminal guidance is managed by a terrain contour matching system and an image matching system, ensuring that it strikes its target with admirable accuracy.

One of the most striking features of the Kh-101 is its range - it can target objects up to 5,500 kilometers away. It's the multiple weapon payload that makes the Kh-101 such an adaptable weapon in the Russian military's arsenal.

Ammunition used

Reports from Ukraine's Ministry of Defense recount the use of 12 Iskander-M ballistic missiles, five Kh-22 cruise missiles, seven Kh-47M2 ""Dagger"" aeroballistic missiles, and 22 S-300/S-400 anti-aircraft guided missiles in addition to the intercepted missiles on the day of the assault. Currently, no reports confirm the interception of these weapons.

2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

On February 21, 2022, Russia stated that its border facility was attacked by Ukrainian forces, resulting in the deaths of five Ukrainian fighters. However, Ukraine quickly dismissed these allegations, labeling them as 'false flags'.

In a notable move on the same day, Russia announced it officially recognized the self-proclaimed areas of DPR and LPR. Interestingly, according to Russian President Putin, this recognition covered all the Ukrainian regions. Following this declaration, Putin sent a battalion of Russia's military forces, tanks included, into these areas.

Fast forward to February 24, 2022, global headlines were dominated by a significant incident. Putin commanded a forceful military assault on Ukraine. Led by Russia's impressive Armed Forces positioned at the Ukrainian border, this assault wasn't spontaneous but a premeditated action. Despite the circumstances resembling a war, the Russian government refrains from using this term. They'd rather refer to it as a ""special military operation"".",bulgarianmilitary.com,news,Bulgarian Military Industry Review,Boyko Nikolov,-0.1764705882352942,448806541,1,https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Crushing-blow-of-Kh-101-strike-on-Ukraines-hydroelectric-lifeline.jpg,zho-1581358

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

While many big names from the cricketing fraternity have declined to take coaching services, the PCN now aims to have a hybrid model for the coaches for the Pakistan cricket team. PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi has desired a foreign coach but stressed a Pakistani assistant for the coach.

Former Australia player Shane Watson was reportedly in talks with the PCB for a head coach role. The deal if it had fruition on time, would have seen the veteran cricketer earning 2 million dollars annually. Naqvi claimed that the intrusiveness of the media led to the decline of the deal. However, Watson continues to coach Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League.

By the proceeding of the PCB, it is evident that they are leaning towards an Australian for the coaching responsibilities. While Watson was the big fish, the likes of Simon Katich and Justin Langer too showed no interest in coaching the Pakistan national team. The board even initiated a conversation with New Zealand's Mike Hesson only to go in vain.

The sources revealed that the board had approached former England coach Andy Flower and reportedly declined the offer. Their PSL star Daren Sammy was another option they explored, but his contract with the West Indies board came in between and he made himself unavailable. Notably, Mathew Hayden has also been approached by the board and he was previously part of the coaching staff.

The PCB are adamant that they do not want their former stars to take the coaching reigns. As Azhar Mahmood, presently residing in England has revealed that there has been no contact made from the board's side on the coaching stint. The issue further complexes with the fact that most of the coaches are either committed to IPL or abstain from the hierarchy they have been subjected to if taken responsibility.",crictracker.com,news,CricTracker,,0.03529411764705892,448806339,1,https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1710507243644_PCB-chairman-Mohsin-NAQVI.jpeg,eng-9413073

The team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem showcased the significant role Binance played in empowering SHIB holders through its innovative payments platform, Binance Pay. The 17th edition of Shib Magazine, released on March 20, 2024, shed light on this partnership, underlining the seamless integration of Shiba Inu into the Binance Pay ecosystem since November 2022.

Binance Pay, a pioneering contactless payment technology, has emerged as a game-changer for SHIB enthusiasts, enabling them to utilize their holdings for real-world transactions. Since its integration, Binance Pay has collaborated with leading payment providers, facilitating SHIB holders' ability to purchase goods and services across various e-commerce platforms, travel destinations, and even gift cards for loved ones.

SHIB holders benefit from Binance pay integration

One of the paramount benefits highlighted by the Shiba Inu team is the ability for SHIB holders to utilize their crypto profits directly through Binance Pay, without the need to convert their assets into fiat currency. This capability has become increasingly relevant amidst the recent surge in crypto asset prices, with SHIB reaching a notable peak earlier this month. Encouraging users to harness their SHIB gains for everyday transactions underscores the growing utility and accessibility of cryptocurrencies in daily life.

Moreover, the publication underscores the remarkable strides made by Shiba Inu within the Binance Pay ecosystem. Notably, Shiba Inu-related transactions on Binance Pay witnessed a substantial surge of over 30% year-over-year between 2022 and 2023, cementing its position as one of the top-performing assets within the platform. Additionally, Shiba Inu ranked among the top 6 most popular crypto assets by transaction count on Binance Pay during this period, further affirming its growing adoption and relevance in the digital payments landscape.

Binance pay widens Shiba Inu acceptance across borders

Binance's strategic partnerships have played a pivotal role in driving Shiba Inu's adoption as a viable payment method. Notably, collaborations with industry players like CoinGate, Bin Faqeeh, and Ingenico have facilitated the integration of SHIB across various merchants and service providers worldwide. From enabling real estate purchases to fostering acceptance in retail stores and online platforms, these initiatives underscore Binance's commitment to expanding the utility and accessibility of Shiba Inu as a payment asset.

Furthermore, Binance Pay's reach extends beyond traditional borders, with SHIB payments now accepted in nine Latin American countries, including Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina. This expansion into new markets reflects Binance's ongoing efforts to make cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu more accessible and usable on a global scale. As Binance continues to forge strategic alliances and integrate with additional payment providers, Shiba Inu is poised to witness further adoption and integration into mainstream commerce.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Mutuma Maxwell,0.419607843137255,448806257,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DALL·E-2024-03-07-12.15.44-Imagine-a-digital-representation-of-the-Shiba-Inu-cryptocurrency-concept.-Visualize-a-sleek-futuristic-digital-coin-shimmering-with-vibrant-colors-.webp,eng-9405694

Good morning! It's Friday, March 22, 2024, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know.

Electric vehicle sales in America are doing alright; they now account for roughly 10 percent of all cars sold across the country, and that figure keeps growing. But do you know what figure is growing quicker? The number of plug-in hybrid models being sold around the world.

Demand for plug-in hybrid models is far outpacing that of battery-powered cars, reports Automotive News. The site explained that sales of PHEVs grew faster than those of fully-electric models across Europe in February, reversing a trend that had seen EV sales soar in recent years. As the site explains:

Plug-in hybrid sales rose 12 percent to 72,376 last month compared with February 2023, while BEV sales increased by 10.3 percent, according to figures from industry association ACEA released on Thursday.

Preliminary figures from market analyst Dataforce - minus statistics for several smaller countries -- showed that plug-in hybrids and BEVs grew at the same pace. Full-electric car sales were up 11 percent, while plug-in hybrids gained 10.9 percent, Dataforce figures showed.

Significantly, plug-in hybrids outpaced the overall market, which was up 10.3 percent, according to ACEA. Dataforce figures showed market growth of 10.3 percent.

According to the site, the best-selling plug-ins across Europe are the Volvo XC60, the Porsche Cayenne and the Mercedes GLC, with a combined 11,000 units sold across the bloc in February. Plug-in models are also gathering pace in the U.S., where automakers like General Motors have announced plans to increase investment in the sector.

After the Takata airbag inflator recall impacted millions of cars across America, another potentially defective inflator is now parking recalls across the country. Stellantis has been forced to issue a recall affecting more than 280,000 cars due to side curtain airbag inflators that could throw shrapnel into the cabin when they go off.

The second Stellantis airbag recall to be announced this week affects 284,982 cars, including Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 models, reports Reuters. The recall, which was announced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) earlier today affects cars built between 2018-2021 that were fitted with SABIC inflators. As the NHTSA explains:

Chrysler (FCA US, LLC) (Stellantis) is recalling certain 2018-2021 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 vehicles. The right and left side curtain airbag inflators may rupture due to a manufacturing defect.

An inflator rupture may result in sharp metal fragments striking occupants, resulting in injury or death.

Dealers will replace both side curtain airbags, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 3, 2024.

The slightly explosive airbag inflators are as a result of moisture that may have found its way into the components during production. The moisture inside could corrode the parts, weakening them so they could explode when they go off.

An investigation into the defective parts was launched last year, and its findings encouraged Stellantis and the NHTSA to issue the recall notice. So far, Stellantis has been made aware of five customer assistance records in relation to the issue. It has also had two warranty claims filed, but has so far received no field reports of the explosive airbags.

Hallmark has left Bentley with immediate effect, and will start his new role in Gaydon ""no later than 1 October 2024"", said Aston in a statement.

Felisa - who was CEO of Ferrari from 2008 to 2016 - will be busy in his final months as boss, with Aston ramping up to replace the DBS and launch the Valhalla supercar by the end of this year.

According to a statement from Bentley, Hallmark is now busy ""preparing for new tasks outside the Volkswagen Group."" Felisa is, meanwhile, getting ready for the ""transition to new leadership,"" reports Reuters.

Despite it feeling like everything is getting more expensive and harder to track down, that hasn't stopped Americans from buying cars. Lots and lots of cars. So many, in fact, that sales of new cars are predicted to rise by double digits in March 2024.

According to new figures shared by Reuters, sales of new cars are projected to grow by more than 12 percent in March, fueled by strong demand for new cars and increased inventory at dealers across the country. As Reuters explains:

Total new-vehicle sales for March 2024, including retail and non-retail transactions, are expected to reach 1,525,700 units, a 12.1% jump from a year ago.

Average transaction prices are trending toward $44,186, down 3.6% from March 2023, while average incentive spend per vehicle has grown 66.6% from a year ago and on track to reach $2,800.

Total retailer profit per unit is expected to decline by around 32% in the month.

The declining profits at automotive retailers across the country might ring alarm bells for dealers, but it could offer a glimmer of hope for anyone in the market for a new car. According to Reuters, the lower profits are as a result of increased inventory and more cars sitting unsold on dealer lots. As such, some are being forced to cut prices as ""competitive pressures intensifies.""",jalopnik.com,news,Jalopnik,,0.1215686274509804,448806027,1,"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f66b3bf9e64037d37d549bbadac93d8d.jpg",eng-9417995

The Dnepr Hydro Power Plant (HPP), a vital source of energy for Ukraine, has been severely damaged following a massive wave of Russian strikes, the head of the facility's operating company said on Friday.

The Dnepr HPP, located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. It was directly hit by two Russian missiles, the head of operator Ukrhydroenergo, Igor Sirota, claimed an interview with Radio Svoboda, a branch of the US-funded RFE/RL.

Zaporozhye Region voted to join Russia in the fall of 2022, although parts of the region are still held by Ukrainian troops.

The Ukrhydroenergo head offered a grim assessment of the situation at the Dnepr facility, saying ""we are losing the plant."" He added that the second unit of the plant had been hit, and that ""the support has been damaged... In other words, Dnepr HPP-2 is in critical condition, Dnepr HPP-1 is not operational either.""

Ukrhydroenergo is currently assessing the extent of the damage to the second unit, but a fire has complicated those efforts, Sirota added. It is clear at this point that the entire main generator hall and electrical equipment will need to be restored, he claimed, although he said there is no danger of a dam breach.

Sirota reported that no one was killed in the Russian strikes on the facility, although Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said there was one casualty.

A video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Russia missile moving toward the plant at high speed, before a powerful explosion rocks the facility.

Built in the early days of the Soviet Union during a period of large-scale industrialization, the Dnepr hydroelectric plant is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region and is a crucial source of energy for Kiev.

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched dozens of missiles and drones targeting the country's energy infrastructure in one of the most powerful barrages in weeks, causing widespread blackouts. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said several mines in Dnepropetrovsk Region and part of Kiev-controlled territory in Russia's Donetsk Region had been cut off from electricity.

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the biggest electric power station of its kind in Ukraine, stopped functioning following Russia's missile strike on Friday.

Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise that manages many major hydroelectric power plants along the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, told local broadcasters that the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station has been severely damaged.

The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, also known as the Dnipro Dam, is located in the city of Zaporizhzhia and is made up of two units, but none of them are working, Syrota said.

""We can't even get to all of the damaged areas to inspect. Today, it is difficult to figure out how long it will take to make it operational,"" he said.

The power cut from the damaged Dnieper Hydroelectric Station may cause an energy shortage in many Ukrainian regions.

Earlier in the day, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said Russia had launched its largest attack on the country's energy system since the beginning of the year.

The minister said in a statement that power generation facilities, as well as electricity, lines, and energy distribution systems, were hit in several of Ukraine's regions.

""The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, as last year, to cause a large-scale malfunction of the country's energy system. ... There are power outages in some regions of Ukraine,"" he said.

Glushchenko noted that one of the power lines supplying the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was de-energized during the shelling.

The management of the plant confirmed the shutdown of one of the two operating high-voltage lines, noting that there was no threat to the safety of the nuclear facility.

The Ukrainian authorities reported a series of explosions across Ukraine earlier Friday morning, and the air raid alert sounded in all regions. -",en.haberler.com,news,Haberler.com,,-0.06666666666666665,448805645,1,,eng-9416762

This integration aims to enhance visibility and accessibility for crypto users, particularly those involved with Ethereum transactions. Initially, Google allowed users to search for specific public addresses and view wallet balances directly. However, the functionality has now been extended to include ENS domains. This expansion was noted by former ENS core team member Brantly Millegan.

While the integration marks a significant step forward in crypto visibility, some users have reported variability in availability. According to observations, the feature tends to work more consistently in private browsing mode or when logged out of Google services. This development highlights Google's increasing involvement in the cryptocurrency space and its efforts to streamline the user experience for crypto enthusiasts.

With Google's integration of Etherscan, users can now access enhanced details regarding Ethereum transactions. This includes the ability to search ENS domains and view wallet balances associated with blockchain addresses. The data is sourced from Etherscan and reflects the last external transaction.

By providing this information directly in search results, Google aims to simplify the process of conducting Ethereum transactions and enhance overall crypto visibility. While the expanded service offers numerous benefits for crypto users, it also raises considerations regarding data privacy and security. As Google continues to integrate with blockchain platforms like Etherscan, it will be essential to monitor how these developments impact the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Google has recently broadened its scope in the cryptocurrency domain by integrating with Etherscan for Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This integration aims to enhance visibility and accessibility for crypto users, particularly those involved with Ethereum transactions. Initially, Google allowed users to search for specific public addresses and view wallet balances directly. However, the functionality has now been extended to include ENS domains. This expansion was noted by former ENS core team member Brantly Millegan.

While the integration marks a significant step forward in crypto visibility, some users have reported variability in availability. According to observations, the feature tends to work more consistently in private browsing mode or when logged out of Google services. This development highlights Google's increasing involvement in the cryptocurrency space and its efforts to streamline the user experience for crypto enthusiasts.

With Google's integration of Etherscan, users can now access enhanced details regarding Ethereum transactions. This includes the ability to search ENS domains and view wallet balances associated with blockchain addresses. The data is sourced from Etherscan and reflects the last external transaction.

By providing this information directly in search results, Google aims to simplify the process of conducting Ethereum transactions and enhance overall crypto visibility. While the expanded service offers numerous benefits for crypto users, it also raises considerations regarding data privacy and security. As Google continues to integrate with blockchain platforms like Etherscan, it will be essential to monitor how these developments impact the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

We complete the Fourier optics convolution right after the generated turbulence-affected multiplexed OAM beams via a DMD 4F-based system and the construction of a hybrid optical-electronic neural network (OECNN) system. We test our neural network by demultiplexing the 4-bit OAM-coded signals. Results show the proposed OECNN performs a demultiplexing accuracy of 72.84% under strong turbulence conditions with 3.2 times training time faster than designed all electrical convolutional neural network (ECNN).

The OAM-carrying beams with helical wavefront, being potentially employed in various applications, which are generally called vortex beams, could be best described in terms of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams which have an azimuthal phase term of exp(ilθ), representing an on-axis phase singularities of order l, where θ is the azimuthal angle and l is known as topological charge of the beam, ideally taking infinite value, which determines the number of times the phase should change by 2π on one single rotation around the beam axis. So far, various state-of-the-art methods for the generation of LG beams have been successfully developed, such as using spiral phase plates, diffractive phase holograms, cylindrical lens pairs, metamaterials, q-platesand more. In this study, we use the spatial light modulator (SLM) with the phase-modulated fork grating pattern to convert the input Gaussian-like beam to the OAM beam. For the detailed generation procedure see section Supplementary Note 1. The example of experimentally generated LG modes see Supplementary Fig. 1. We experimentally generate and use single-ringed LG modes () where p = 0 () to achieve the simplest and clearest optical ring intensity formation.

When LG beams with the same waist position and parameters are coaxially superimposed, they interfere and produce a vortex structure, resulting in complex patterns of bright and dark regions. Here, we demonstrate the superposition of two co-propagating LG beams with topological charge l1 and l2, where the formation of complex amplitude at z = 0 can be written as:

By multiplexing and , they interfere at ∣l2 - l1∣ azimuthal positions, resulting in a transverse intensity profile of ∣l2 - l1∣ petal-like patterns. An example of the experimental generated transverse intensity profile of two multiplexed LG beams is shown in Fig. 1. For all three cases, the circular symmetric intensity profile comprises fourteen (∣l2 - l1∣) bright petals, where Fig. 1b ( + ) maintains no peripheral vortices, Fig. 1a ( + ) and Fig. 1c ( + ) show rotated intensity (counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively) due to the effect of Gouy phase difference between two LG beams with different absolute value of topological charge (∣l2 - l1∣). Theoretically, the complex field distribution of the multiplexed LG beams with unlimited integer topological charge numbers n at z = 0 can be written as:

the petal-like patterns of multiplexed LG beams with n superimposed numbers are related to the corresponding Gouy phase differences among selected OAM modes, generating unique intensity profiles.

In FSO communication, one critical challenge that needs to be addressed is atmospheric turbulence. The refractive index of the atmosphere undergoes stochastically variations spatially and temporally due to the temperature inhomogeneities and atmospheric pressure, which cause the wavefront to be randomly distorted as it propagates where manifested as intensity fluctuation, beam wandering, and scattering. In the OAM-carrying FSO communication link, atmospheric turbulence-induced aberrated helical phase front results in the channel crosstalk and information blending among multiplexed OAM modes. This would significantly decrease the transmission efficiency, impairing the stability and reliability of FSO communication systems. The most widely accepted theory of atmospheric turbulent flow was first put forward by Kolmogorov in 1941. Since then, the theory of turbulent fluctuation could be directly related to refractive-index variation by introducing the Kolmogorov turbulence model. Hitherto, many other practical models that improve the agreement between theory and experimental measurement are proposed and used, such as Tatarskii, von Kármán, modified von Kármán and Hill model. In this study, we use the modified von Kármán atmospheric turbulence model as turbulence simulation; for the detailed introduction of the turbulence model see section Supplementary Note 2; The example of a computer-generated random atmospheric turbulence phase screen using the modified von Kármán turbulence model see Supplementary Fig. 2. The atmospheric turbulence is simulated by uploading the generated phase-modulated turbulence screens onto the SLM, affecting the incident multiplexed OAM beams.

In recent years, deep learning has advanced significantly with the utilization of CNNs, which are pivotal in image-related tasks such as object detection and classification. However, traditional electronic-based computing systems for CNN inference require numerous computationally intensive convolution operations, often demanding high-performance hardware and generating substantial thermal loads. The 4F optics system sidesteps these limitations by completing Fourier optics convolution passively in the frequency domain. The digital micromirror device (DMD) serves as an optical gate, modulating the incoming light based on the applied convolutional kernels. The output sensor, typically a camera or a photodiode array, captures the convolved images and saves them as data to be further processed electronically; for the detailed introduction see section Supplementary Note 3. The 4F system's optical nature drastically reduces computing latency and power consumption. It stands as an innovative, high-speed alternative for performing all electronic CNN inference and offers new possibilities in integrated photonics computing.

We first generate OAM-coded beams with two multiplexed topological charge numbers and collect the dataset under four different atmospheric turbulence scenarios with original, weak (D/r = 0.15), medium (D/r = 0.3), and strong (D/r = 1.5), respectively. We choose three indistinguishable cases where the topological charge numbers are consecutive integers (l1 = 6, l2 = - 8; l1 = 7, l2 = - 7, and l1 = 8, l2 = - 6) and two distinguishable cases where the topological charge numbers have higher difference value (l1 = 9, l2 = - 8, and l1 = 10, l2 = - 10).

For each case, 1000 images are collected under each turbulence level. 20,000 images are generated after SLM1. After being convolved with 16 kernels, 320,000 images are captured by the camera and collected as the dataset. On the subsequent electronic layers side, the dataset is packed in groups of 16. We label these five OAM-coded beams as five classes. For each class, we randomly shuffled and split the collected 1000 images with the training set of 800 and the validation set of 200 to guarantee that both sets are completely independent. We compare the classification accuracy between the OECNN and ECNN. Since both neural networks are trained on the dataset with unique intensity patterns, we define the demultiplexing accuracy as the classification accuracy of the neural network.

We run both neural networks over 50 epochs five times, and the averaged results are shown in Fig. 2. The demultiplexing accuracy of the ECNN is 94.58%, 89.34%, 86.84%, and 84.32% for four different levels of atmospheric turbulence (Fig. 2a), with a full training time of 604.75s. The OECNN shows the demultiplexing accuracy of 87.96%, 83.39%, 81.87%, and 74.23% under the preset turbulence level order (Fig. 2b), with a full training time of 454.7s. The training time of OECNN is 1.3 times faster than ECNN. Then, we generate the 3-bit OAM-coded signal (topological charge l = - 7, l = - 5, and l = 6 are applied) with 8 classes in full to train both neural networks. The ECNN (Fig. 2c) shows the demultiplexing accuracy of 96.38%, 94.61%, 91.88%, 89.84%, with a full training time of 1004.9s. The OECNN (Fig. 2d) shows the demultiplexing accuracy of 89.52%, 85.87%, 84.07%, 76.13%, with a full training time of 504.8s. The training time of OECNN is 2 times faster than ECNN. At last, we generate and train the 4-bit OAM-coded signal (topological charges l = - 7, l = - 5, l = - 2, and l = 6 are applied) with 16 classes in total on both neural networks. The ECNN (Fig. 2e) shows the demultiplexing accuracy of 94.53%, 92.34%, 90.13%, 82.61%, with a full training time of 1954.8s. The OECNN (Fig. 2f) shows the demultiplexing accuracy of 86.74%, 82.87%, 81.61%, 72.84%, with a full training time of 604.85s, where OECNN shows 3.2 times training time faster than ECNN. As the number of classes exerts minimal impact on the calculation of total floating point operations (FLOPs), the total number of FLOPs of ECNN is averagely calculated as 26,843,340 FLOPs. The total number of FLOPs of OECNN is 9,298,451 FLOPs; for complete calculation and comparisons see Supplementary Table 1 in section Supplementary Note 4.

An apparent divergence could be observed in the comparative analysis of the demultiplexing accuracy between ECNN and OECNN. The demultiplexing accuracy of OECNN manifests a decrement of around 5% to 8% relative to its ECNN counterpart, even up to 13% under strong atmospheric turbulence levels. A closer inspection of the validation accuracy curve for the OECNN revealed a continued increase, even as the designated 50 epochs concluded, insinuating an ongoing learning process. In contrast, the validation curve associated with the ECNN stabilized, indicating cessation in its learning after 50 epochs. This discrepancy can be attributed to the inherent characteristics of the datasets. The OECNN-based datasets possess higher levels of distortion and noise due to the intrinsic systematic error of the experimental setup, especially gained from the beam aberration and distortion caused by the undesired tilted angle of the SLM and DMD. In addition, certain pixel losses during the experimental pixel-wise multiplication process are disregarded due to the physical pixel limitation of the SLM and DMD. For each class, a dataset comprising only 1000 images is employed. The limited data volume is considered to potentially curtail the achievable demultiplexing accuracy, especially when encountering circumstances where multiple applied topological charge numbers are consecutive, rendering the intensity pattern of OAM modes more analogous to one another, resulting in increased homogeneity and reducing their discernibility.

Besides the comparative analysis on demultiplexing accuracy, the comparison of the training time between the ECNN and the OECNN also yields noteworthy results. The training efficiency gain is particularly pronounced as the dataset's class number increases. This trend illustrates the OECNN's enhanced capability in managing extensive, large-scale datasets, a critical factor in practical neural network-based OAM communication scenarios. Furthermore, in evaluating our OECNN, we observed that the convolution layer accounts for 65% of the total FLOPs. This result indicates that while convolution remains a major component of the CNN's computational process, its proportion is moderately lower compared to the mainstream neural networks with more complex structures, such as AlexNet and VGGNet, which are characterized by multiple convolution layers with a larger number of kernels and sizes, allocate a higher percentage of their computational budget to convolution operations. This variance is primarily due to our OECNN being designed with one single convolution layer to realize the complete Fourier optics convolution operation integrating with the current optical setup. Despite this, our findings affirm the convolution layers are the main consumers of computational resources during inference tasks. Furthermore, our results underscore the potential application of optical-electronic/all-optical acceleration in more complex, convolution-intensive neural network architectures, demonstrating significant prospects for future enhancements in processing efficiency.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2705882352941176,448804906,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42005-024-01571-3/MediaObjects/42005_2024_1571_Fig1_HTML.png,

The Dnepr Hydro Power Plant (HPP), a vital source of energy for Ukraine, has been severely damaged following a massive wave of Russian strikes, the head of the facility's operating company said on Friday.

The Dnepr HPP, located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region. It was directly hit by two Russian missiles, the head of operator Ukrhydroenergo, Igor Sirota, claimed an interview with Radio Svoboda, a branch of the US-funded RFE/RL.

Zaporozhye Region voted to join Russia in the fall of 2022, although parts of the region are still held by Ukrainian troops.

The Ukrhydroenergo head offered a grim assessment of the situation at the Dnepr facility, saying ""we are losing the plant."" He added that the second unit of the plant had been hit, and that ""the support has been damaged... In other words, Dnepr HPP-2 is in critical condition, Dnepr HPP-1 is not operational either.""

Ukrhydroenergo is currently assessing the extent of the damage to the second unit, but a fire has complicated those efforts, Sirota added. It is clear at this point that the entire main generator hall and electrical equipment will need to be restored, he claimed, although he said there is no danger of a dam breach.

Sirota reported that no one was killed in the Russian strikes on the facility, although Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said there was one casualty.

A video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Russia missile moving toward the plant at high speed, before a powerful explosion rocks the facility.

Built in the early days of the Soviet Union during a period of large-scale industrialization, the Dnepr hydroelectric plant is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the region and is a crucial source of energy for Kiev.

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said Moscow had launched dozens of missiles and drones targeting the country's energy infrastructure in one of the most powerful barrages in weeks, causing widespread blackouts. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry said several mines in Dnepropetrovsk Region and part of Kiev-controlled territory in Russia's Donetsk Region had been cut off from electricity.

Fiat's ongoing renewal of the now 17-year old 500 for markets outside Europe could reportedly be ending based on reports of the second generation getting a hybrid powertrain alongside the electric it debuted with four years ago.

At present, the 500e's motivation comes from a 42-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that produces 87 kW, translating to a top speed of 150 km/h and 0-100 km/h in nine seconds.

Available as either a hard-top or the cabriolet flavoured 500C, the setup supports charging up to 85 kW with a claimed range of 320 km, or 50 km after eight minutes. The overall waiting time from 20-80% using the DC fast charger is said to be 35 minutes.

According to carscoops.com, citing a report from the Corriere Torino newspaper though, sales of the 500e have been below exceptions to the extent that Fiat has commissioned an investigation to make it available with the hybridised Firefly petrol engine sold in the ""old 500"" still available in parts of Europe.

Largely attributed to costs and the slow-down of electric vehicle sales in Europe following the ending of incentives in certain countries, the publication states the final investigative report only requires the signature of Stellantis CEO, Carlos Tavares, which will pave the way for a partially combustion engine ""new"" 500 becoming a likely reality within the next few months if the go-ahead is given.

A move that will see the 500e following the 600e that received a hybrid powerplant last year, Automotive News Europe, in a related report, states the approval of the hybrid 500 will help increase production at the Mirafiori plant to 175 000 units versus the 77 260 of 2023.

At the same time, the publication reports that while the Tychy plant in Poland produced 104 000 combustion engine 500's last year, only 62 000 electric 500e emerged from Mirafiori, whose other produced products include the Maserati Quattroporte, GranTurismo and Ghibli.

Should approval be given, the new faced 500, without the ""e"" suffix, will feature a vented grille and possibly a gear lever in the case of a manual transmission being introduced.

On the power front, the mentioned Firefly combines the Brazilian-made 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine with a mild-hybrid system for a total system output of 51kW/92Nm.

A move that could be expanded to the performance Abarth 500e if deemed viable, the inclusion of a partial petrol engine could pave the way for the ""new"" 500's entry into South Africa in place of the old model last received a series of updates of 2021.

While neither Fiat nor Stellantis have commented on the claims of either publication at present, don't be surprise if a formal announcement confirming the hybrid ""new 500"" emerges within the coming months.",citizen.co.za,news,The Citizen,Charl Bosch,0.2,448804642,1,https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/500e1.jpg,eng-9411424

The first set of 131-meter-long onshore wind turbine blades, the longest in the world, have been successfully produced in Bayannur, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to local authorities.

The blades rolled off assembly line on Thursday at the Sany Renewable Energy in the Bayannur zero carbon smart industrial park. They will be installed in large megawatt wind turbine units, thereby boosting wind power generation capacity and efficiency.

The new blades exhibit excellent stability and durability, challenging the limits of manufacturing materials in terms of stiffness and strength and driving innovation in modern manufacturing technology. The wind turbine blades have already undergone component and full-size testing.

Sany Renewable Energy has transitioned from traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, and enhanced product precision through digitalization technology, sources with the company said. Additionally, these blades use recyclable polyurethane structural components to improve recyclability while achieving mass production.

The zero carbon smart industrial park covers an area of approximately 540 mu with a total investment of about 1 billion yuan (US$138.3 million).

Talon Vance, 14, weighed just 40 pounds when he was found dead in the Colorado Rockies last year alongside the bodies of his mother Rebecca ""Becky"" Vance, 42, and 41-year-old aunt, Christine Vance, 41, both conspiracy theorists relying on YouTube videos to teach them survival skills.

He chronicled his depression and fears in a diary found next to his mummified remains, according to heartbreaking excerpts shared by Outside Magazine.

They show that he initially seemed excited when his mom urged him to learn survival skills including how to tie knots and build shelters -- telling one friend: ""Side note: I did the trucker's hitch first try!!""

However, he also detailed how friends -- many of whom he only knew by their usernames on the video game Roblox -- begged him not to leave his regular life in Colorado Springs, the journal entries show.

""Please I will give anything for you to come back,"" one wrote, while another said: ""NOOO COME BACK.""

Some even changed their usernames to reflect the loss of their friend, Outside noted.

By the time the trio finally left home in August 2022, Talan was already fearing for his mental health, he noted in an entry about stopping in an Arby's in Gunnison.

""I also had a mini breakdown at Arby's because nothing feels the same anymore [sad face],"" the teenager wrote.

He said his aunt brought him to the local grocery store ""and let me pick out candy of my choice"" but he was ""so sad that nothing really sounded appealing to me anymore.,""

""So I picked out chocolate for mommy mostly, and then Aunty suggested fruit snacks for me, so I just said 'OK.'""

Not much is known about how the three spent their days living in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, but they had packed only rudimentary items for their survival -- including an $80 tent from Walmart, a fishing pole and seed packets for food, according to the investigation by Outside Magazine.

They would make occasional trips into town for food, until their car was found abandoned in November 2023 and was towed away by the US Forest Service.

Ford's luxury brand is introducing cutting-edge digital tech -- but without the battery skateboard chassis underneath.

Debuting inside the midsize Nautilus SUV, the Lincoln Digital Experience's 48-inch, pillar-to-pillar screen is the most revolutionary cabin since Tesla -- leaning into the brand's ""quiet luxury"" theme along with self-driving Blue Cruise, boutique dealership experiences and digitally-scented tech. Under the hood are traditional, sippy, turbo-4 gas engines.

""(We're) listening to what customers really need. Navigator customers tend to tow more, so (battery power) doesn't make as much sense,"" said Lincoln President Dianne Craig in an interview, referring to the brand's flagship, three-row, twin-turbo V6-powered SUV. ""That's how we think about this transition -- whether it's hybrids, plug-in hybrids, full hybrids, ultimately to EVs down the road -- it's going to e different depending on segmentation. And segmentation is different based on different customers we serve.""

That's a sharp U-turn from just two years ago. In April 2022, Lincoln was sprinting to an electric future under then-President Joy Falotico with the introduction of the Lincoln Star Concept -- revealing a new, dynamic, grille-less fascia complete with light show like crosstown rival Cadillac and its Lyriq EV.

The Star was the first of three EVs to be delivered by next year -- and a fourth by 2026 -- as the brand predicted half of its global volume would be electric by mid-decade. At the EV's Los Angeles premiere, brand spokesperson and actor Matthew McConaughey gushed that the Star ""has a wonderful identity. It's not a new page; it's a new chapter.""

At the Nautilus media test drive here, there was not an electric vehicle in sight.

""Back in 2021 and 2022, there was overall hope from automakers that was ahead of what was realistic,"" said analyst Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global associate director of auto intelligence. ""You have to sell to pragmatic buyers after the first adopters and that's been hard to do. Electric vehicles are not taking off like the industry expected.""

The Blue Oval's Ford brand took the lead on EVs, unveiling the Mustang Mach-E SUV and Lightning pickup to rave media reviews and a flood of customer pre-orders. Fast forward to January and the Mach-E was the nation's eighth-slowest selling vehicle with 302 days of inventory according to CarEdge. Lightning, meanwhile, reduced production from three shifts to one due to reduced demand.

Still, the niche sales brought Ford needed breathing room from government regulations that threaten other automakers with billions in fines in the decade ahead. Toyota, for example, says it will pay the fines rather than build vehicles customers don't want.

MOSCOW, March 22. /TASS/. Ukraine's largest hydroelectric plant, the Dnieper HPP, has been shut down after a fire and damage, the plant's operator, Ukrhydroenergo, said.

""To date, the plant is not working,""Ukrhydroenergo director Igor Sirota said during a Rada TV broadcast.

The Dnieper HPP is located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye and consists of two plants: HPP-1 and HPP-2. ""As of today, the plant - in fact, both of them - are not working. So we are working out different modes, how we will pass water,"" he specified. Earlier, the director reported that HPP-2 was in critical condition.

Sirota described the extent of the damage as ""very large."" ""We can't even get to all the places to inspect,"" he added. ""Today it is difficult to say how long it will take to rebuild it,"" the director pointed out.

He said experts expect to determine the extent of the damage and the timeframe for rebuilding by the end of the day. Sirota also said that the fire at the plant has been localized, but smoke is still visible.

The Dnieper HPP is the largest hydroelectric plant in Ukraine. In the early morning, traffic on the highway that crosses the plant's dam was completely restricted. Later, Ukrhydroenergo reported a fire at the Dnieper HPP.",tass.com,news,TASS,,-0.2,448802145,1,https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png,

Our study introduces the deterministic balanced method (DBM) for optimizing hybrid energy systems, with a particular focus on using hydrogen for energy balance. The DBM translates the sizing optimization problem into a deterministic one, significantly reducing the number of iterations compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comparative analysis with HOMER Pro demonstrates a strong alignment of results, with deviations limited to a 5% margin, confirming the precision of our method in sizing determinations. Utilizing solar and wind data, our research includes a case study of Cairo International Airport, applying the DBM to actual energy demands.

Hybrid off-grid systems, designed for longevity, possessed inherent complexities. Notably, integrating hydrogen as an energy storage solution amplified the challenges related to system sizing. While hydrogen offered remarkable energy density and could be produced from renewable sources, its high levelized cost of energy (LCOE) necessitated meticulous optimization to bring down the overall system LCOE. Batteries had been a predominant choice in hybrid systems, but the allure of hydrogen storage as a sustainable alternative was undeniable. Still, the harmonious interplay between wind and solar PV systems mitigated their energy production shortfalls, enhancing the system's comprehensive reliability. Increasingly, these hybrid energy configurations were seen as the vanguard for sustainably powering remote and off-grid regions.

Research conducted in described the design information of solar PV and wind turbine hybrid power generation systems to provide electricity to a model community of 100 households and a health clinic and elementary school. The optimal simulation results in this study showed that solar PV/wind turbine/diesel generator/battery and converter was the best-configured system for their application with a renewable fraction of 84%. Many research papers have introduced different system configurations and comparative analysis for deciding the most economically feasible one. One of these researches in presented a case study in the desert region of the United Arab Emirates. This study introduced a technical-economic analysis based on integrated modeling, simulation, and optimization approach to design an off-grid hybrid solar PV/FC power system. This system was designed to meet the residential community's energy demand of 4500 kWh/day (150 houses). The total power production from the distributed hybrid energy system was 52% from the solar PV and 48% from the FC with a 40.2% renewable fraction, which was a low value for the renewable energy penetration of this system. Consequently, one of the main concerns of our paper is how to achieve a renewable fraction of 100% in the simulated configurations of various hybrid off-grid systems. These given numbers of renewable fractions are used to provide a rough estimate for the previous research that focused on the penetration of renewable resources (increasing the renewable fraction percentage) and selecting the best configuration for the application targets.

Another approach for choosing the best size and location for off-grid hybrid systems was presented by. They considered economic, technical, social, and environmental factors to discover the ideal capacity and location for continually meeting the load while reducing LCOE and overall life cycle cost. The hybrid algorithm based on the geographic information system, simulated annealing, and enhanced harmony search was evaluated with real data for a genuine case study in South Khorasan, Iran, and the findings showed that it provided more accurate results than those from previous heuristic approaches. Compared to a standalone diesel system, the hybrid system saved 8948 L of diesel generator fuel and reduced pollutant emissions by 59.6% according to the IHS SA-GIS methodology. Cai et al. and Alberizzi et al. presented a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and an algorithm implemented through Matlab software to determine the ideal size of a hybrid solar-wind system with battery storage to replace a diesel-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) for a mountain lodge in South Tyrol, Italy. This gap in understanding the optimal sizing and location for hybrid systems, particularly in different geographical and environmental contexts, is a key focus of our study.

Research in conducted a reliability-based analysis of different combinations of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines with a backup system. The study aimed to compare the sizing of three hybrid energy systems: solar PV/Genset, Wind/Genset, and solar PV/Wind/Genset, focusing on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, total annual costs, or both. Utilizing the gravitational search algorithm, the study's results were juxtaposed with those obtained from the simulated annealing method. This comprehensive examination encompassed 45 cases, integrating economic and environmental analysis and considerations of human health impacts due to carbon dioxide emissions. The findings revealed that the PV/Wind/Genset system was optimal, achieving a 27.2% reduction in pollution and a 4.76% cost saving compared to the solar PV/Genset system. Additionally, the imposition of carbon taxes on hybrid system designs proved effective, reducing CO2 emissions by about 9% and lessening health-related damages by 8.9%. While comprehensive, this study highlights the need to explore diverse optimization algorithms and system configurations further to enhance environmental and economic efficiencies in different geographical contexts.

Research work in introduced a novel method for optimizing power planning in renewable hybrid systems, including wind turbines, PV systems, bio-site units, thermal storage, and electric vehicle facilities with smart charging. Their approach minimized NPV and LCOE using a refined cost model and a modified multi-objective function. Bio-site units enhanced efficiency and reduced emissions, while adaptive smart charging reduced LCOE and NPV by optimizing load and storage requirements. The study also incorporated uncertainties in renewable sources, load demands, and electric vehicle aspects, adding robustness but increasing resource and storage needs, thus raising costs. They applied an advanced Grey Wolf Optimizer combined with the Sine Cosine Algorithm for better convergence and stability. The research highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in renewable energy systems, especially given inherent uncertainties, suggesting the need for more sophisticated optimization strategies.

Figure 1 provides a visual taxonomy of optimization methods used in energy system sizing, classified by their nature and complexity. It illustrates a spectrum ranging from deterministic approaches like linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), integer linear programming (ILP), and dynamic programming (DP), to nature-inspired and metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and ant colony optimization (ACO). The complexity gradient, denoted by the color bar, indicates that deterministic methods, while established earlier, tend to offer lower complexity relative to the more recent metaheuristic or nature-inspired methods. This suggests that deterministic methods, despite their simplicity, remain a robust choice for energy system optimization, especially in scenarios where computational efficiency and the guarantee of reaching an optimal solution are paramount.

Our study, as outlined in Table 1, addresses significant gaps in renewable energy system (RES) sizing optimization literature. It uniquely combines a deterministic methodology with hydrogen system sizing and computational efficiency, a combination not extensively explored in previous research. Our approach involves detailed 1-year simulations across diverse system configurations shown in Fig. 2, offering a comprehensive view of RES performance. A distinct feature of our research is the theoretical analysis of optimality, which, alongside thorough techno-economic assessments, provides deeper insights into RES optimization. Further, our findings are validated with commercial software.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.4274509803921569,448801452,51,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-55631-3/MediaObjects/41598_2024_55631_Fig1_HTML.png,eng-9409690

A day after reports said that beleaguered edtech major BYJU'S was planning to shut 200 out of its 300 offline tuition centres, the company said that about 90% of its centres would continue to operate in hybrid model while the remaining would be restructured.

""In light of few recent reports falsely suggesting the closure of many BYJU'S Tuition Centres (BTCs), BYJU'S firmly states that such an implication is entirely unfounded and misrepresents the company's operational strategy,"" BYJU'S said in a statement on Friday (March 22).

The edtech giant said that its offline centres are entering their third year of operations and 90% of them (262 centres out of 292) would continue to function in a hybrid model. Meanwhile, the rest will undergo a ""strategic restructuring to align with BYJU'S long-term vision"".

BYJU'S also said that most of its current students have already signed up for the next academic year - 2024-25, and the tuition centres are entering their third successful year of full-capacity operations.

It is pertinent to note that a report, earlier this month, said BYJU'S has given up all its office spaces in India, except its Bengaluru headquarter, in an attempt to cut costs. Its tuition centres were also set to start working from home for an indefinite period, the report said.

It is pertinent to note that BYJU'S is currently dealing with a pool of legal cases. Recently, a US insolvency court ordered the arrest of a hedge fund manager for allegedly helping the edtech startup in hiding $533 Mn from its lenders for $1.2 Bn term loan B (TLB). However, BYJU'S said that the judge quashed the lenders' request seeking the deposition of the $533 Mn with the court and ordered maintaining the status quo.

Besides, from fighting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), BYJU'S is currently fighting more than a dozen cases amounting to over $1.5 Bn.

Amid the ongoing troubles, BYJU'S investors called for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) last month and passed a resolution seeking the ouster of the company CEO Byju Raveendran from his position.

Earlier this month, the Karnataka High Court extended the stay on the implementation of the resolutions passed by BYJU'S investors of BYJU'S till March 28.

Meanwhile, in another development this week, BYJU'S reportedly issued a notice to its shareholders for an EGM on March 29 to increase its authorised share capital following its $200 Mn rights issue.

BYJU'S filed its FY22 financial statements almost 22 months after the end of the year. Its net loss surged 81% YoY to INR 8,245.2 Cr in the year.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Both regions have been subject to shelling and drone attacks in recent weeks and officials have said that attempts by Ukrainian fighters to cross into Russian territory have been repelled.

The application for change of use at an existing waste transfer building in Newpark Industrial Estate to a thermal recovery building was given the go-ahead at a meeting of Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council's planning committee this week.

Planning officer Alicia Leathem told the committee the process will generate electricity to power the plant at McQuillan Envirocare waste treatment.

The report said: ""The site is currently Northern Ireland's primary hazardous waste transfer station for solid wastes with a chemical treatment facility for both hazard and non-hazardous waste.""

The report notes pharmaceutical waste comes from customers such as Almac Group and health trusts. NI Water and DuPont are also listed. It also indicated ""feedstocks"" for the proposed thermal recovery facility include pharmaceutical waste, oil sludge, paint/adhesives, rags/wipes, polymer waste, laboratory smalls/solid toxic solvents and various liquid solvents.

The officer indicated that statutory bodies have not raised any objections. However, she reported there has been ""a large volume of objections"" from other parties.

Ulster Unionist Councillor Leah Smyth told the meeting she met with the applicant McQuillan's on site a few months ago.

She said she has been contacted ""numerous times"" about the application. She also stated she is a resident of Newpark. Cllr Smyth said ""What alarmed me the most is the lack of clarity about emissions and impact on local air quality.

""As a mother of two children with respiratory issues, I do not want it on their doorstep. It is far too close to a residential area. Residents are also concerned about noise. This incinerator is not wanted. I would urge you to please refuse the application.""

DUP Cllr Paul Dunlop expressed concerns the proposal may ""endanger the health of the community"".

Cllr Dunlop went on to ask for more engagement between McQuillan's and the local community.

Permission was granted following a vote in which five councillors were in favour with one against and two abstentions.

In a statement issued after the meeting, Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Mark Cooper said: ""I welcome this £6m green investment in our borough, the project aligns with the council's commitment to sustainability by minimising environmental impact and optimising resource utilisation.""

Access to cheap capital critical to address financing gaps in large-scale projects (roads, railway, power, etc), SMEs and other key sectors has been a major bottleneck in Uganda and Africa at large as far as growth and development is concerned.

Many African nations continue to stagnate economically due to predatory financiers (banks, private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund firms in Europe), who lend on abnormal interest rates or finance such projects at unfavorable conditions.

However, President Yoweri Museveni, whose dream of a united East Africa and later Africa is still alive, has got a diagnosis: establishment of an indigenous patient capital and cross-border African Investment Bank.

He envisages this form of capital as crucial for projects and enterprises that require time to mature and generate returns.

Col. Edith Nakalema, the head of State House Investors Protection Unit (SHIPU) is now rallying all Ugandans and government agencies heads to support the initiative which she believes is a magic bullet in turning around Uganda's economic fortunes to the level of Asian economic giants like China, Singapore, Malaysia and others.

Col.Nakalema was on Thursday addressing government agency heads and key stakeholders in the private sector and financial institutions at her offices located on Plot 51B along Lumumba Avenue, Nakasero-Kampala, ahead of a meeting with President Museveni today at State House Entebbe over the same.

The brainstorming meeting was attended by National Planning Authority officials led by chair Prof. Pamela Mbabazi, NSSF MD Patrick Ayota, Bank of Uganda bosses (Deputy Governor Dr. Michael Atingi-Ego and Tumubweine Twinemanzi, the Executive Director of the Bank Supervision Directorate), and Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA) new Executive Director, Samuel Were Wandera.

""Since my docket is tasked with investment, H.E President Kaguta Museveni tasked me to coordinate this engagement. This was a strategic preparatory meeting, inspired by President Museveni's visionary idea of establishing an African Investment Bank whose focus will be on indigenous patient capital and supporting cross-border economic collaboration as envisaged by the president. We are paving the way for a financial institution that will transform Africa's investment landscape. This is the right time for Africa to craft solutions for our challenges,"" Col.Nakalema explained.

Others present at the meeting include Hez Kimoomi Alinda, the Executive Director of Uganda Free Zones Authority (UFZA), Bageya Waiswa, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Works and Transport, Maj. (Rtd). Gertrude Njuba, former Minister Prof. Tarsis Kabwegyere, former Attorney General Mr. Fred Ruhindi, former Uganda Law Society (ULS) president, Francis Gimara, Andrew Musiime the Director Economic Affairs EAC secretariat, officials from Capital Markets Authority, Uganda Securities Exchange, the Insurance Regulatory Authority of Uganda, Uganda Investments Authority and among others.

""President Museveni is eager and believes this project [idea of an African Investment Bank] will work. As a flag bearer of the project, he needs our support. I urge you to help him in the East Africa and Africa integration agenda,"" Col.Nakalema rallied.

NPA chair, Prof. Mbabazi, highlighted the significance of patient capital in driving sustainable growth, emphasizing its potential to unlock opportunities for projects like the Standard Gauge Railway.

""The establishment of indigenous patient capital aims to strengthen Uganda's private sector, crucial for driving socioeconomic transformation amidst challenges like high interest rates and limited funding,"" Prof. Mbabazi stressed.

Ayota, the NSSF MD, said the initiative is timely especially at a time when international lenders continue to attach strings on their capital. He cited an example of the recently passed Anti-homosexuality law meant to preserve Ugandan culture only to attract threats from the World Bank.

BoU's Deputy Governor Ego described the idea as interesting while Executive Director of the Bank Supervision Directorate, Twinemanzi, described it as fantastic.

""The idea is very good,"" added FIA's Wandera.

Former ULS president, Gimara welcomed the initiative and tasked NPA bosses to open their eyes and think of more cross-border impactful projects.

For former Minister Kabwegyere, this is one of the efforts to counter those with neo-colonialism tendencies.

""Business financing has been extractive and tends to attract predatory capital (foreign banks charging crazy interests), which causes economic marginalisation and results in massive capital flight. We need Indigenous Patient Capital that focuses on long-term gains rather than short-term profits now more than ever,"" noted former Jumia CEO, Ron Kawamara.

Dr. Beenunula Eyenunula, the CEO of TRAVACO is the brain and key consultant behind the project.

To realize this, he says the government ought to start with establishing cross-border impactful projects. These include SME parks and multimodal logistics corridors with the end result of retaining optimum value within Africa and indigenous patient capital.

African Investment Holding Ltd (AIHL) will be created for this effect.

AIHL will be granted control of African In-Situ minerals.

Through Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC) asset management practices, AIHL plans to create cash flow proceeds within six months.

Through In-situ Minerals, credit lines and cash flow for industry and infrastructure will also be created.

""With a minimum capital requirement of USD 5 million, the project seeks to mobilize asset management practices to generate cash flow proceeds within six months,"" he explained.

It is African Investment Holding Ltd (AIHL) which will lead to the creation of the Africa Investment Bank.

According to Beenunula, focus will be on Private Placement Programs, also called ""High Yield

Investment Programs"" which is his area of expertise for over 20 years.

Private Placement Programs, also called ""High Yield Investment Programs"", are private (non-public) investment programs which are based on the purchase or sale of bank financial instruments.

In most cases MTNs are mainly used.

These instruments are bought fresh-cut with a high discount on their base value to later be resold at a higher price in the secondary market.

The difference between the sale price and the purchase price is the investor's profit. These programs are offered to investors with high spending capacity and can only be executed by qualified traders with a license to carry out these kinds of transactions.

A very special aspect of these programs is that usually the largest part of the returns is allocated to humanitarian causes as well as to the financing of larger business projects.

So, any institution takes precedence on this type of operation.

Actually, PPPs are not well known publicly, and only a very small group of investors that own significant funds or Bank Instruments have access to them. Most programs can be joined by invitation only.

These programs have been issued since for the past 60 years to finance humanitarian projects and international trade.",redpepper.co.ug,news,Red Pepper Uganda,,0.3333333333333333,448799997,1,https://redpepper.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/s-1.jpg,

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

This number considers both fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, from models as small as the X1 xDrive25e and iX1 to as large as the M760e and i7. Speaking during the annual press conference yesterday, company CEO Oliver Zipse said the German luxury brand is about to sell the one-millionth EV.

Although demand for fully electric cars seems to be cooling, the BMW Group delivered 74.1% more EVs in 2023 than the year before, reaching 375,716 units. The share of fully electric vehicles in total deliveries rose from 9% in 2022 to 14.7% last year. In the long run, the automotive conglomerate still believes EVs will account for more than 50% of total annual sales by the end of the decade. However, it cautions that will only happen if there's going to be a well-developed charging infrastructure by then.

The long-term plan is to continue investments in gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid powertrains since BMW argues an electric-only future is still distant. BMW will sell cars equipped with combustion engines well into the 2030s and potentially ever after that. Its ultra-luxury Rolls-Royce brand will offer an electric-only lineup by 2030 while MINI will follow suit early into the next decade.

By 2030, the BMW Group estimates to deliver 10 times more EVs than it has so far by selling 10 million cars without combustion engines. To get there, it's making a huge bet on the Neue Klasse platform that will underpin six EV-only models by 2028. It also intends to start production of at least six electric vehicles in Spartanburg by 2030.

BMW reckons an electric vehicle doesn't necessarily have to carry around large and heavy batteries. It's not giving up on pursuing hydrogen fuel cell technology, which is why it's currently testing a fleet of iX5 Hydrogen prototypes. Lessons learned from this program ""are being incorporated into the development of a potential series product.""",bmwblog.com,news,BMW BLOG,Adrian Padeanu,0.09019607843137245,448799655,1,https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bmw-i7-m70-velvet-orchid-black-sapphire-01.jpg,deu-1763374

The blockchain payment company that launched USDC, Circle, is now considering the possibility of bringing its U.S. dollar stablecoin to the Ripple (XRP) Ledger.

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has emerged as one of the most versatile blockchains in the crypto sphere, providing lots of security, fast transactions, and low transaction fees. Over 1,500 projects worldwide are currently leveraging XRP's Ledger because of its capabilities.

However, Ripple hasn't been able to attract either of the two stablecoins, Circle and Tether (USDT) to its ecosystem despite smaller projects like Tron and Algorand being able to do so.

Panos Mekras, a proponent of bringing stablecoins to the XRP ecosystem recently emailed Circle to gain insights on why USDC isn't yet on XRPL. Circle responded to his inquiry by expressing their interest in adding USDC to more blockchains including the XRP Ledger.

While Ripple Labs continues to look for ways to expand XRPL, InQubeta (QUBE) has emerged as one of the best altcoins to buy as its presale soars right past its initial $10 million funding goal. More than $12 million has now been raised and it's now on course to generate as much capital as the ICO of top cryptocurrencies like the Ethereum (ETH) network which raised $18.3 million during its presale.

InQubeta is expected to enjoy lots of growth in 2024 thanks to the solution it looks to offer investors who can't access traditional artificial intelligence (AI) investment opportunities because they can't meet the arbitrary requirements many of these investment firms have.

Such people currently don't have a way to invest in emerging AI startups but InQubeta plans to change things with its Ethereum (ETH) hosted network.

The artificial intelligence space has enjoyed major investor interest over the past several years as investments in the technology reached over $120 billion. Analysts predict that over $1.5 trillion will stream into AI by 2030, positioning InQubeta for tremendous growth as it's the only cryptocurrency that focuses on making artificial intelligence investments easier to access.

Some of the AI firms emerging today will go on to present solutions that transform industries in the future, positioning investors to build generational wealth. InQubeta will democratize access to such investment opportunities once its NFT marketplace is launched.

AI startups that want to fundraise on InQubeta's ecosystem are audited to determine if they're eligible to fundraise on its marketplace. Once cleared, they get to create non-fungible tokens that offer equity and reward-based investments.

Investors can learn about the different companies fundraising in the NFT marketplace and read expert opinions on them. They can invest in any AI firms they like by buying portions of their NFTs. Fractionalization makes that possible.

Investors can also earn massive returns by buying and holding QUBE. Tokens now go for $0.028 as the presale enters its ninth stage, but they could be as high as a dollar before the year ends.

While Circle didn't acknowledge that Ripple Lab's ongoing issues are probably one of the reasons why USDC hasn't been launched on the XRP Ledger, it might have played a role.

There's a lot of uncertainty around the project as its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) continues and that has even prevented the project from enjoying the massive gains other altcoins have in the past six months.

XRP and QUBE are two top altcoins to buy now for different reasons. XRP's growth might have been slow lately, but its prices will likely skyrocket once its legal issues are resolved. QUBE is set for as much as 1,000% growth thanks to the easy access to AI investments it intends to offer its users.",coinpedia.org,news,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,Pr Manager,0.3411764705882352,448798774,1,http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/04205435/usd-coin.webp,eng-9407201

The round was led by True Ventures, the Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm, with participation from Manchester-based investment firm Praetura Ventures, NatWest, Mastercard, Route 66 Ventures, and Beringea.

This latest round of capital will be instrumental in driving AccessPay's focus on profitable growth while bolstering its commitment to increasing revenues in a sustainable manner. A significant portion of the funding round will be dedicated to AccessPay's Research and Development (R&D) work, ensuring continued value creation for its enterprise customers. Notably, the company plans to further develop its capabilities in fraud & error prevention, bank statement data and reconciliation automation, and ISO 20022 data transformation, as well as to continue AccessPay's rapid expansion in the US.

Anish Kapoor, CEO at AccessPay, said: ""We are thrilled to announce the close of our latest funding round. For us, it reflects investor confidence in our vision and potential for long-term growth. I'm exceptionally proud of our success since the company was founded in 2012, especially considering the macroenvironmental challenges we have weathered over the years. This funding will play a crucial role for the latest stage of our evolution.""

Over the last couple of years, the AccessPay team has made several senior hires, and expanded geographically beyond the UK, including mainland Europe and the United States via partnerships with Sage and Finastra. This round of funding will provide AccessPay with the financial resources to maximise these strategic growth opportunities, including potential acquisitions to sustainably expand its market presence and offerings.

Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures, commented: ""AccessPay simplifies corporate and institutional banking processes by streamlining all bank and finance apps into a shared interface.

The biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, receives its electricity from the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which caught fire as a result of the strikes.

Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, announced early on Friday that the plant's primary 750 kilovolt power connection had been severed. He claimed that a lower-power backup line was operational.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus.

Details on the projects that have received funding are expected to be announced as soon as Monday, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information hasn't been made public yet. The grants will be spread across sectors such as cement, glass, chemicals, metals, and pulp and paper, they said.

The money will be aimed at industries that account for nearly a quarter of US emissions, but are challenging and expensive to shift to lower-carbon technologies. Cleaning up these sectors will be critical if the White House wants to achieve its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero by mid-century.

The Department of Energy, which is awarding the funding, had previously encouraged companies to file full applications for more than 100 proposals.

Among those, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is proposing to make steel using hydrogen, as well as another project to expand production of the metal for electrical transformers and electric vehicle motors at its Butler Works plant north of Pittsburgh, according to one of the people. Century Aluminum Co., based in Chicago, was encouraged to proceed on at least two different proposals, including construction of the first primary smelter for the energy-intensive metal in the US in decades, the person said.

The Energy Department and the two companies didn't respond to requests for comment.

Almost $5.5 billion of the money for the grants will come from President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The Energy Department, which announced the funding last March, said at the time it would be used to ""drastically reduce industrial emissions"" and demonstrate first-of-a-kind or early-stage decarbonization technologies that had previously seemed decades away.

""We hear every day about industrial companies that are interested in decarbonizing their plants, but the initial costs can be daunting,"" said Nora Esram, a senior director for research with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington-based nonprofit. ""The federal funds are geared to enable them to invest in new technologies to cut emissions while supporting community development.""",investmentnews.com,news,InvestmentNews,,0.223529411764706,448798548,1,https://s32566.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sustainability-and-green-business-with-icons-on-crystal-balls-renewable-energy-concept-reduce.jpg-s1024x1024wisk20c-umx8LZSnGdHfCqGUYS-fejXkG3bW_qBaftHuKLzmT81.jpg.optimal.jpg,

Ford's luxury brand is introducing cutting-edge digital tech -- but without the battery skateboard chassis underneath.

Debuting inside the midsize Nautilus SUV, the Lincoln Digital Experience's 48-inch, pillar-to-pillar screen is the most revolutionary cabin since Tesla -- leaning into the brand's ""quiet luxury"" theme along with self-driving Blue Cruise, boutique dealership experiences and digitally-scented tech. Under the hood are traditional, sippy, turbo-4 gas engines.

""(We're) listening to what customers really need. Navigator customers tend to tow more, so (battery power) doesn't make as much sense,"" said Lincoln President Dianne Craig in an interview, referring to the brand's flagship, three-row, twin-turbo V6-powered SUV. ""That's how we think about this transition -- whether it's hybrids, plug-in hybrids, full hybrids, ultimately to EVs down the road -- it's going to e different depending on segmentation. And segmentation is different based on different customers we serve.""

That's a sharp U-turn from just two years ago. In April 2022, Lincoln was sprinting to an electric future under then-President Joy Falotico with the introduction of the Lincoln Star Concept -- revealing a new, dynamic, grille-less fascia complete with light show like crosstown rival Cadillac and its Lyriq EV.

The Star was the first of three EVs to be delivered by next year -- and a fourth by 2026 -- as the brand predicted half of its global volume would be electric by mid-decade. At the EV's Los Angeles premiere, brand spokesperson and actor Matthew McConaughey gushed that the Star ""has a wonderful identity. It's not a new page; it's a new chapter.""

At the Nautilus media test drive here, there was not an electric vehicle in sight.

""Back in 2021 and 2022, there was overall hope from automakers that was ahead of what was realistic,"" said analyst Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global associate director of auto intelligence. ""You have to sell to pragmatic buyers after the first adopters and that's been hard to do. Electric vehicles are not taking off like the industry expected.""

The Blue Oval's Ford brand took the lead on EVs, unveiling the Mustang Mach-E SUV and Lightning pickup to rave media reviews and a flood of customer pre-orders. Fast forward to January and the Mach-E was the nation's eighth-slowest selling vehicle with 302 days of inventory according to CarEdge. Lightning, meanwhile, reduced production from three shifts to one due to reduced demand.

Still, the niche sales brought Ford needed breathing room from government regulations that threaten other automakers with billions in fines in the decade ahead. Toyota, for example, says it will pay the fines rather than build vehicles customers don't want.

""Ford has changed its plans for electrification and that has impacted Lincoln,"" said auto analyst Brinley.

Confirmed Craig: ""We're not going to make any grand declarations specific to where the brand is going with electrification until . . . we relay understand what our premium customers want. The time will come, for sure, but right now we are focused on the wonderful product lineup we have between the Corsair, Nautilus and new Aviator.""

What that product line shares with the electric Star Concept is the wall-to-wall jumbotron. The Nautilus allows Lincoln to focus on its technology story -- which has been synonymous with EVs -- while maintaining buzz with gas-electric hybrid drivetrains in Nautilus and Corsair.

""Nautilus is important because its is bringing tech into the brand,"" said Brinley.

The panoramic screen complements a digital, push-button console shifter and seven digital scents that customers can release into the cabin. This tech in the Nautilus will migrate to other models.

""It's not just tech for tech's sake, it's very intuitive tech,"" Craig said. ""The screen is stunning when you get into the car. It's first in segment. It needs to be simple, it need to be intuitive, because some of these technologies are not.""

The Lincoln Digital Experience was introduced to media here much like a living room suite, with journalists taking system tutorials while in a hotel -- before taking the Nautilus out on the road.

Tesla and Lucid luxury brands introduce customers to their unique, high-tech interiors -- not in dealerships -- but in boutiques inside shopping malls and in city storefronts. Stripped of the intimidation of sales desks and test drives, boutiques allow casual customers to sample features.

Lincoln, too, is moving to this idea as a way to advance its slogan: Power of Sanctuary.

The brand has encouraged closing traditional dealerships and opening what it calls vitrines (inspired by French glass display cases) like the dealer-run Sanderson Lincoln Boutique in Scottsdale, Arizona, or the brand-owned Lincoln Experience Center in Newport Beach, California.

Vitrines are comfortable spaces complete with technology demonstrations, a café, and a few new cars.

""It's about meeting customers where they want us to serve them,"" said Craig. ""We have our vitrines -- almost 60 that are done -- they are beautiful facilities that are all about being warm and personally crafted. We have another 30 in the works.""

""We know our customers want a no-pressure environment,"" she continued. ""If a customer doesn't want to come into a dealership, then we will meet them on their terms, including in their home or place of business.""

That low-pressure environment extends to not forcing EVs, even as automakers like Lincoln see the transition as inevitable.

""There is transition with any technology including electric vehicles. We'll eventually come to that tipping point,"" said the Lincoln president. ""But right now (from) everything we are learning from our customers, now is not the right time for us to be making those declarations about EVs.""

It is desirable for these smart inverters to operate with maximum efficiency as well as provide grid services such as voltage and frequency regulation. A smart inverter design can improve the reliability and resilience of the grid, reduce the cost of energy, and ease grid maintenance. This is done through the management of active power generation and reactive power compensation between the solar inverter and the electric grid. Enhanced designs have the potential to increment efficiency, reduce system loss-related heatsink size, and minimize installation cost. The purpose of this research is to develop a smart solar microgrid inverter. This design shall prove to be low cost with high efficiency and power density. The goal of our team is to identify trade-offs between efficiency, cost, and volume. In addition, our team seeks to achieve innovations in circuit topologies and smart inverter control strategies, optimization in circuit parameters, and the application of highly efficient wide-bandgap devices. Two stages are realized in the microgrid inverter design: a DC-DC stage and a DC-AC stage. The DC-DC stage employs a frequency-modulated LLC resonant converter with zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for a wide load range. The DC-AC stage consists of a grid-connected three-leg converter which can be operated in a single-phase or three-phase mode depending on the number of legs that are switched. The possibility of using a single converter for both modes reduces the number of circuitries needed in the system. Consequently, this increases the power density of the system. Stiff DC link is employed to have a decoupled system that helps in closed-loop control and provides flexibility to scale the converter to process more power. The DC-DC stage can be modularized, and the DC-AC stage can be scaled as needed to process more power. Wide-Bandgap GaN devices are chosen to implement the converter's DC-DC and DC-AC stages owing to their inherently superior Figure-of-Merit (FOM) that helps improve performance. Higher frequency operation is proposed for both stages to improve the overall power density and have higher control bandwidths.",digitalcommons.usu.edu,news,Utah State University,,0.4588235294117646,448798445,1,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/fsrs2021/1066/preview.jpg,eng-9417885

Key Takeaways

Microsoft 365 File Viewer has new features: Faster with ""Open in app"" feature, sync files seamlessly to OneDrive, see list of people with access. SharePoint Premium subscriptions offer e-signatures, PDF editing, file merging, and more. Features rolling out to commercial customers across OneDrive and SharePoint, with availability in Teams and Copilot capabilities coming later.

If you're an avid Microsoft 365 customer, you've likely come across File Viewer; the interface that allows you to access non-Office files in services like OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. It's the technology that allows you to preview and open PDF, CAD, video, and audio files, even enabling users to perform basic image editing and annotation on images. Now, Microsoft has announced a bunch of new capabilities that it is rolling out to File Viewer.

What's new in Microsoft 365 File Viewer?

For starters, Microsoft 365 File Viewer is notably faster now, with files displaying twice as quickly as before. There's also a handy ""Open in app"" option available directly in File Viewer, which enables users to open content in native applications with the changes being synced seamlessly to OneDrive once the file in question is saved. In addition, you can now see the list of people who have access to certain content by tapping their images and also ""favorite"" a file through the dedicated icon.

There are other changes in store too, but they are linked to certain premium subscriptions. For example, you can securely request e-signatures, remove pages from PDFs, and merge multiple PDFs into a single file as well. You can also annotate certain file formats like .ai, .tiff, .rtf, .epub, and more, and then use the annotations toggle to include or remove them from view. However, all of this requires a SharePoint Premium subscription. Finally, Copilot integration is in the works too and should be available soon with several capabilities like file summarization and Q&A.

What's the rollout schedule?

Almost all the aforementioned features have started rolling out to commercial customers across OneDrive and SharePoint. They are slated to become available in Teams, along with Copilot capabilities later this year as well. We'll likely find out more details regarding availability in the coming weeks.",xda-developers.com,news,XDA-Developers,Usama Jawad,0.1686274509803922,448798125,1,https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/copilot-keyboard.jpg,eng-9418435

The company also plans to employ 10,000 people by 2026 in an effort to accelerate electrification.

According to Iberdrola, electrification across all sectors is now ""unstoppable"" due to the rapid pace of decarbonisation across all sectors. It is therefore critical to ensure electricity network infrastructure can be located where it's needed in advance.

Expanding and strengthening networks will receive the largest chunk of investment (60%) at €21.5 billion with a focus on US, UK, Brazil and Spain. Approximately two-thirds of the investment will target distribution and one-third will target transmission.

Russia has attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages and killing at least three people, officials said.

Energy minister German Galushchenko said the overnight drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times.

He added: ""The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early on Friday. A lower-power backup line is working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station is not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said.

A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

The blades rolled off assembly line on Thursday at the Sany Renewable Energy in the Bayannur zero carbon smart industrial park. They will be installed in large megawatt wind turbine units, thereby boosting wind power generation capacity and efficiency.

The new blades exhibit excellent stability and durability, challenging the limits of manufacturing materials in terms of stiffness and strength and driving innovation in modern manufacturing technology. The wind turbine blades have already undergone component and full-size testing.

Sany Renewable Energy has transitioned from traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing, and enhanced product precision through digitalization technology, sources with the company said. Additionally, these blades use recyclable polyurethane structural components to improve recyclability while achieving mass production.

The zero carbon smart industrial park covers an area of approximately 540 mu (36 hectares) with a total investment of about 1 billion yuan (about 138.3 million U.S. dollars).

The Castelli Tutto Nano bib shorts have been designed around the Nano Flex 3G material to optimise performance in colder conditions as well as provide some weatherproofing in rain showers. The legs are extended and the front is raised to aid insulation, with reflective inserts on the rear of each leg. The chamois is comfortable but not the thickest, so for longer days in the saddle it can become less comfortable. The shorts perform brilliantly for the price though.

The Castelli Tutto Nano bib shorts use Castelli's Nano Flex 3G fabric, which combines a soft thermal lining with a water repellent outer while mesh bibs aid breathability. There are reflective inserts on the rear of each cuff of the leg, while the chamois is Castelli's Kiss Air2 seat pad. The straps are slightly meshed to provide better breathability. Castelli claims the shorts work best between 13-20°C while they are available in sizes from XS to 3XL and only in Black.

Performance

Using the Castelli Tutto Nano bib shorts across a range of conditions, they perform very well across quite a wide array of temperatures. As a pair of shorts by themselves, they offer enough breathability to be used on the turbo and at temperatures up to about 20 degrees. In cooler conditions when paired with leg warmers, they offered enough insulation in temperatures of 3-5 degrees. The raised front face and Nano Flex fleece material do a lot to keep the heat in, while the straps allow a good amount of breathability for the upper body. The Nano Flex material also works very well when it comes to water repellency, even after a few washes, and works very well in light showers but not so much in prolonged rain.

The straps themselves are mesh and offer decent support without pulling on the shoulders. A size medium in these shorts fits similarly to other brands' size medium shorts, which is often not the case with Castelli. The leg grippers are effective against bare skin or leg warmers, however they struggle with longer leg hair and rise up a bit. The chamois is Castelli's Kiss Air2 with dual-density foam, which is pretty comfortable in rides between 2-3 hours long. However on longer rides or bumpier roads the thinner chamois can become a little less comfortable.

An area where these shorts shine is the overall value, as they come in a lot cheaper, at £130, than many other thermal bib short alternatives. For this price they perform brilliantly and offer really good insulation and decent comfort, but for those looking for enhanced comfort or even more effective weatherproofing and insulation, it may be worth considering something more expensive.

Conclusion

The Castelli Tutto Nano bib shorts offer really good thermal insulation, solid water repellency, and decent levels of comfort, all at a very competitive price. However the chamois lacks the all-day comfort of some higher end competition.",cyclist.co.uk,news,Cyclist,,0.419607843137255,448797661,1,https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1.jpg,

Beginning next year, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Japan intend to combine their QR code mobile payment systems to streamline transactions and skip currency exchange requirements.

This strategy was announced by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan (METI), and the Vietnam News Agency (VNA). Its purpose is to make spending a smoother experience throughout the regions.

METI is currently in discussions with central banks and governments around the world, including - but not limited to - those in Southeast Asia. The reason is to help move that initiative ahead more broadly.

A QR code mobile payment system is under development by the Cashless Promotion Council to help bring together domestic and international services. It is expected to be completed before the close of this year.

Among the companies offering this type of mobile transaction in Japan are Rakuten Pay and Paypay. That said, the new system being developed by the Cashless Promotion Council will make it possible for shoppers to complete transactions using any service through the scan of a quick response code at the store, sidestepping the current service limitations that work only within registered networks.

In 2022, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines - all ASEAN countries - signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for integrating payments and initiating interactions in a number of areas.

Now, Japan is hoping to accelerate the ASEAN countries negotiations in order to put the new service into effect quickly.

In 2022, the non-cash payment transactions made in Japan came to about 111 trillion yen ($750 billion). Only around 2.6 percent of that total represented transactions completed using a QR code scan or other barcode-based mobile payment transaction.

On the other hand, six major Southeast Asian country digital payments totals reached $858 billion in that same year.

The dam at the hydroelectric station is not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said.

A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the internal affairs ministry.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the Telegram messaging app: ""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus.

""Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people.""

Kremlin officials said on Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell landed nearby while she was walking her dogs, with two other people injured.

The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, according to governor Roman Starovoit.

The global airline industry has consistently cautioned passengers about the inevitable need to contribute to the $5 trillion expense of decarbonizing air travel. That time has now arrived.

What Happened: Airlines across the world are raising ticket prices to offset the expenses of decarbonizing air travel, reported Bloomberg on Thursday. The cost of sustainable aviation fuel, a primary tool for achieving the industry's 2050 net-zero target, is more than double that of traditional jet kerosene. This has left airlines with little choice but to transfer the additional cost to passengers.

""We've entered a new era,"" said Rico Luman, a transport, logistics, and automotive economist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. ""Flying will turn more expensive.""

Several countries have introduced measures to fund the transition. Singapore is imposing a tax on airfares, while Malaysia has authorized carriers to levy a carbon fee. In Europe, airlines are losing a quarter of their free emissions allowance, leading to ticket prices rising.

Despite the variations in policies, the common objective is to clean up an industry that has relied on fossil fuels for a century. Airlines fear that failure to demonstrate a serious commitment to cutting emissions could result in fines, flying restrictions, or grounding.

""It pains me to suggest that travelers are going to have to pay more,"" Margy Osmond, chief executive officer of Tourism & Transport Forum Australia, said at a renewable aviation fuels conference in Canberra this week. ""There's going to be an additional cost to aviation. That's all there is to it.""

Why It Matters: The aviation industry's shift towards sustainability is not without its challenges. The industry has been grappling with the staggering cost of decarbonization, which is now being passed on to passengers. This is a significant development, considering the global push for sustainable practices and its impact on the aviation sector.

Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser cautioned against the current energy transition strategy, asserting that it is not yielding the expected results. This latest move by Singapore and Malaysia further underscores the complexities and costs associated with transitioning to sustainable aviation fuel.

Meanwhile, Barclays PLC BCS has halted direct financing of new oil and gas fields and restricted lending to energy companies expanding fossil fuel production. This is part of its Transition Finance Framework (TFF) and follows intense pressure from campaigners over its energy policy amid higher climate-damaging emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The paper aims to help Europe harness the full renewable energy potential of its seas and ensure equitable distribution of clean power amongst countries.

The launch was attended by Tinne Van der Straeten, the Belgian minister of energy; Lars Aagaard, the Danish minister for climate, energy and utilities; and Ditte Juul Jørgensen, director general for energy at the EU Commission.

""We are launching our vision paper at a crucial moment. The climate agenda is increasingly becoming an investment agenda so that Europe can reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and retain industry. We are facing European elections and new legislative initiatives will further the implementation of the Green Deal.

According to Elia Group, while offshore hybrids are a crucial element for securing Europe's green transition, to date, only one such project, the Kriegers Flak - Combined Grid Solution, which connects Denmark to Germany, has been realised.

The main reason for this is the current regulatory framework supports the development of either generators or interconnectors, rather than facilitating assets that include both, as is the case with hybrid projects.

The paper also cites that planning strategies tend to prioritise individual national interests, meaning that cross-border and regional solutions are sidelined.

Stated Vandenborre in the paper: ""Current planning approaches are still focused on individual countries, meaning that cross-border and regional solutions are left out. As a result, there is no mechanism for ensuring that the costs of hybrid interconnections are shared out and borne by all the parties and countries who benefit from them.""

Recommendations for hybrid projects

The paper states that purely national solutions will be insufficient to ensure the success of the energy transition and promotes a more regional perspective.

Hybrid interconnectors are critical to ensure counties with fewer renewable resources can access clean power, i.e. these projects ensure a more equitable distribution of green electricity.

The paper makes three recommendations to support the deployment of hybrid projects:

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times.The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

One person was killed and at least eight injured in the Russian attack, said Zaporizhzhia regional governor Ivan Fedorov.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines. Two people died in the Khmelnytskyi region, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry.

""The world sees the targets of Russian terrorists as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, even a trolleybus. Russia is fighting against the ordinary life of people,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian officials said Friday that one person died and at least three were injured in Ukrainian shelling of areas near the border.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a woman was killed when a shell hit nearby while she was walking her dogs and that two others were injured. The town of Tetkino in the Kursk region was shelled, injuring one person, said Gov. Roman Starovoit.

Their findings suggested that valuable information's in short supply and that organisations are keen to allow others to test the water before taking the electrification plunge themselves.

Only a quarter of surveyed organisations have appointed a provider to help them with electrification planning, fleet conversion or charging infrastructure implementation.

Recognising the challenge but not the solution

While professionals within UK businesses seem to have a good understanding of the benefits electrification can bring, very few are confident enough to commit to investment.

The research found a significant EV-adoption knowledge gap and a perception of limited support content. Many prospective adopters cited a lack of valuable information as a contributing factor to their fear of commitment.

Information gathering

The perceived lack of valuable information doesn't necessarily mean there's a shortage of content. Respondents referenced the lack of accredited guidance from central sources of knowledge, suggesting decision makers weren't sure what advice to trust.

Although several government schemes and incentives exist, the research from Drax also found a lack of awareness or understanding among respondents regarding available support and its potential benefits.

Seeking guidance from early adopters

Driven by their fear of commitment, many organisations are turning to early electrification adopters for guidance. These early adopters - whether they've offered advice or not - act as 'influencers' for other businesses to learn from, creating a community-driven framework for navigating the EV transition.

Certain respondents were positive about how supportive other fleet professionals had been - but others spoke of a need for more information sharing. Findings showed a definite preference to wait for other organisations to open up and talk about electrification challenges rather than take unnecessary risks.

Low levels of provider engagement

Specialist EV providers - such as charge point installers and fleet transition partners - can help with electrification planning as well as tangible progress.

However, according to the research, only a third of UK businesses said they'd started reviewing providers. Only a quarter said they'd appointed one.

Other cited support

Amongst responses, it was found that fleet professionals are also using other means to gather relevant information and make electrification decisions. These included:

As it stands, though, word of mouth seems to be the biggest channel for information sharing.

The report, ""Driving change: The state of fleet electrification in the UK"", goes into more detail on what's influencing electrification decisions. It also explores the level of EV transition, the state of the market, what's motivating fleet professionals and the barriers these professionals face.

Trust me.

Every time I walk past the LG MyView Smart Monitor in my room, I think about how much better life would've been had it existed when I was dorming for college. The idea of a 32-inch 4K monitor that doubles as a TV just makes sense, especially for users in confined spaces and/or those who don't have the budget for both appliances. (I also wonder if I would've been able to get any studying done had the latest streaming services been just a remote click away. I digress.)

Also: LG showed me its retro-themed projector and it's even better than I expected

Over the past two weeks, I've been testing the 32SR85U model specifically, priced at $599. That's the highest configuration for the MyView series but comes with a 4K UHD display, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, DCI-P3 95%, and a modular webcam accessory included in the box. I found all of those distinctive features beneficial for workflows that involved photo and video editing, writing, and collaboration. But even if you're more lax about how you use your monitor, there are still good reasons to read on.

Setting up the LG MyView is fairly straightforward; a snap-on mechanism secures the monitor to the height and tilt-adjustable base stand, a power cable keeps the device running, and you can pair a PC or laptop via one of the two HDMI ports on the back. Surely, you can connect a gaming console to the monitor too, but with a max refresh rate of 60Hz, don't expect to see the smoothest animations, even if you're on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox One X.

You can technically operate the monitor without any input source because it is, after all, a smart TV. The MyView operates via LG's webOS 23 platform, which is more user-friendly than I expected, with just about every major streaming service laid out on the home screen and several ""Quick Cards"" above them for access to content folders like Game, Music, Sports, and Home Office.

In theory, this categorization of apps and services should make it easy to navigate the TV. But I often found myself thinking deeply about what I needed to do or wanted to watch on the TV before clicking any further. When in doubt, I'd just go to YouTube or Netflix and call it a day, defeating the purpose of the UX.

Also: I tried LG's new Gram Pro laptops, and they beat my MacBook Air in 3 ways

The design of the MyView is remarkably similar to Samsung's M8 Smart Monitor, from the frosted white finish to the magnetic webcam slot to the handy remote controller. That similarity should come as no surprise, considering how competitive the two brands have been in the home entertainment space. I welcome more options in this niche but ever-evolving smart monitor category.

The MyView is better than the M8 in several ways, the first being the IPS panel versus Samsung's VA. The matte-treated IPS display on the LG monitor makes it ideal for photo and video editing, which are use cases that rely heavily on color accuracy and off-access viewing angles. I'm also a fan of LG's 90W charging via USB-C (versus the M8's 65W) for keeping my beefier MacBook Pro powered throughout the day.

One area where the MyView lags is audio quality -- 5W built-in speakers don't do the multifaceted, entertainment-first nature of the smart monitor any justice, with a tinny, back-firing output that made me reach for a third-party speaker at first listen. For documentaries and podcasts, the monitor's speakers are passable. For just about everything else, I'd connect a secondary source or pair of wireless earbuds because the added hassle is absolutely worth it.

Also: YouTube TV gets multiview on iOS and iPadOS, but not Android, in time for March Madness

Where the MyView smart monitor falls in audio, it makes up for in display quality, with a default color setting that I found pleasant on the eyes and not at all jarring -- which some TV panels tend to be at factory setting. From streaming shows on webOS to editing photos on Adobe Lightroom with my MacBook connected, the MyView didn't overcompensate scenes and visuals to the point where I had to tone things down in the monitor settings, which felt refreshing.

The LG MyView Smart Monitor isn't going to out-pixel a standalone, professional-grade monitor or high-end TV but it does provide a level of convenience that neither of the two can, and at a price that's relatively accessible. The pick-and-choose nature of the MyView means there's likely a smart monitor available for almost every user type.

As I mentioned earlier, this is the kind of product I wished I had back at my college dorm, in which I likely would've opted for the cheapest $199 variant of the MyView with fewer ports and a smaller 27-inch screen.

Within the project, FH is investigating the effects of emergency procedures as well as the handling of additional mitigation measures, like containment bags and extinguishers, under realistic conditions.

Therefore, tests with active cabin crew in the Flight Test Facility of Fraunhofer IBP, a former in-service wide body aircraft located south of Munich, will be conducted in 2025. Furthermore, the project will focus on the risk associated with the number and energy of the PEDs on board and will develop guidelines for the risk assessment of airlines.

To gain the industry perspective, FH is looking for active crew members, cabin crew trainers, and safety managers who want to be involved in the LOKI-PED project. You are welcome to share your perspective and knowledge about the handling of Lithium-Ion battery fires. In addition, you are invited to participate in the tests in the Flight Test Facility. You will benefit from a unique working group bringing together the relevant experts in the field.

A first online meeting with all interested parties will take place on Tuesday, April 9, 2024 from 1 pm to 3 pm (UTC+2). There, FH will introduce the concept of the workshop series and the test program within the LOKI-PED project, share the time table, and discuss legal issues like a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).",euagenda.eu,news,EU Agenda,Eu Agenda Team,0.1294117647058823,448794272,1,,

Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages, officials said Friday.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

The enhancement, supported by Solmedia's native token MEDIA, enables users to benefit from Solana's high-speed blockchain infrastructure and Filecoin's secure decentralized storage, which aims to ensure user content is protected and remains unaltered by unauthorized changes or access.

A senior representative from Solmedia shared that the company is focused on maintaining free speech and transparency in the Web 3.0 space. The use of Solana and Filecoin, in conjunction with the MEDIA token, is intended to provide users with control over their data and content-sharing experiences, aiming to sidestep censorship and biased information.

The adoption of Solana and Filecoin technologies aims to improve user experiences by offering fast transaction speeds, lower fees, and reliable decentralized storage, thus streamlining activities such as uploading, streaming, or accessing content.

The MEDIA token is meant to encourage user participation in the platform's development, reflecting a community-led approach to content consumption that supports the platform's mission to offer an environment free from censorship and promote a variety of perspectives.

Crypto.news reached out to the Solmedia team for more insights on the development but failed to hear back at the time of publication.

According to CoinMarketCap data, the MEDIA token's value had increased by 20% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.10668, with a trading volume of $13.8 million in the same timeframe.

Meanwhile, a March 21 report by Crypto.news highlights the growing global investor interest in blockchain ecosystems, with Solana leading the way.

The report indicates that Solana accounts for 49.3% of global investor interest, showcasing its significant impact on the blockchain community. Ethereum follows in second place, capturing 12.7% of investor interest.

Experts suggest that Ethereum's brand awareness and solid reputation contribute to its popularity. Nonetheless, there is a noticeable shift in investor attention towards second-layer networks built on Ethereum, signaling evolving preferences in the blockchain sector.",crypto.news,news,crypto.news,"Rony Roy, Dorian Batycka",0.2313725490196079,448793694,1,https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2024/03/crypto-news-Solana-option002.webp,

Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages, officials said Friday.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

The paper aims to help Europe harness the full renewable energy potential of its seas and ensure equitable distribution of clean power amongst countries.

The launch was attended by Tinne Van der Straeten, the Belgian minister of energy; Lars Aagaard, the Danish minister for climate, energy and utilities; and Ditte Juul Jørgensen, director general for energy at the EU Commission.

""We are launching our vision paper at a crucial moment. The climate agenda is increasingly becoming an investment agenda so that Europe can reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and retain industry. We are facing European elections and new legislative initiatives will further the implementation of the Green Deal. Our proposals aim to encourage new ways of thinking and discussions between all stakeholders so that we can help Europe harness the full renewable potential of its seas while more effectively distributing the green electricity produced among its countries,"" said Catherine Vandenborre, Elia Group's interim CEO.

Tyrrhenian Link interconnection secures final financing

According to Elia Group, while offshore hybrids are a crucial element for securing Europe's green transition, to date, only one such project, the Kriegers Flak - Combined Grid Solution, which connects Denmark to Germany, has been realised.

The main reason for this is the current regulatory framework supports the development of either generators or interconnectors, rather than facilitating assets that include both, as is the case with hybrid projects.

The paper also cites that planning strategies tend to prioritise individual national interests, meaning that cross-border and regional solutions are sidelined.

Stated Vandenborre in the paper: ""Current planning approaches are still focused on individual countries, meaning that cross-border and regional solutions are left out. As a result, there is no mechanism for ensuring that the costs of hybrid interconnections are shared out and borne by all the parties and countries who benefit from them.""

Recommendations for hybrid projects

The paper states that purely national solutions will be insufficient to ensure the success of the energy transition and promotes a more regional perspective.

Hybrid interconnectors are critical to ensure counties with fewer renewable resources can access clean power, i.e. these projects ensure a more equitable distribution of green electricity.

The paper makes three recommendations to support the deployment of hybrid projects:

Ultimately, Elia Group and Ørsted suggest that EU countries encourage hybrid projects, as more projects will encourage a faster learning loop in terms of commercial, technical and regulatory aspects and accelerated timelines.",smart-energy.com,news,Smart Energy International,Pamela Largue,0.3725490196078431,448793063,1,https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/transmission-interconnector-Latvia-x-Estonia.jpg,

Russia attacked electrical power facilities in much of Ukraine, including the country's largest hydroelectric plant, causing widespread outages, officials said Friday.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

The round was led by the Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm True Ventures, with contributions from a consortium including Manchester-based investment firm Praetura Ventures, NatWest, Mastercard, Route 66 Ventures, and Beringea.

This capital injection marks a significant milestone for AccessPay, which stands at the forefront of streamlining financial processes for corporations and institutions.

The company specializes in integrating a myriad of bank and finance applications into a unified interface, simplifying corporate and institutional banking processes. Through its innovative platform, AccessPay addresses the complex challenges of fraud and error prevention, bank statement data, reconciliation automation, and ISO 20022 data transformation.

With a sharp focus on R&D, AccessPay is committed to enhancing its service offerings, thereby ensuring its enterprise customers continue to receive unparalleled value.

The proceeds from this funding round will be primarily allocated towards R&D efforts, aiming at propelling AccessPay towards profitable growth and sustaining revenue increases. A significant portion of the investment will support the development of advanced fraud prevention mechanisms, and automation capabilities, further solidifying AccessPay's position in the market.

Additionally, the company plans to accelerate its expansion in the United States, leveraging the financial resources to maximize strategic growth opportunities, including potential acquisitions.

Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures, praised AccessPay's innovative approach to banking technology, stating, ""AccessPay simplifies corporate and institutional banking processes by streamlining all bank and finance apps into a shared interface. This astute merging of automation, FinTech, and tooling that improves processes for a massive market is what drew us to invest in this team since its seed investment, and we continue to feel excitement for the company's next phase of growth and expansion.""

Pete Carway, investment director at Praetura Ventures, also expressed his enthusiasm for the investment, highlighting the team's ambition and the operational support provided to ensure AccessPay's success on a global scale.

In recent years, AccessPay has made significant strides in expanding its geographical footprint beyond the UK, entering markets in mainland Europe and the United States through strategic partnerships. This funding round is poised to further fuel AccessPay's growth ambitions, paving the way for innovative solutions in the FinTech sector.

Anish Kapoor, CEO of AccessPay, shared his excitement about the funding round, saying, ""We are thrilled to announce the close of our latest funding round. For us, it reflects investor confidence in our vision and potential for long-term growth. I'm exceptionally proud of our success since the company was founded in 2012, especially considering the macroenvironmental challenges we have weathered over the years. This funding will play a crucial role for the latest stage of our evolution.""",fintech.global,news,FinTech Global,,0.2078431372549019,448792856,1,https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/joe-cleary-sIcAcPOgpMU-unsplash-scaled.jpg,eng-9414643

Energy Minister German Galushchenko said the nighttime drone and rocket attacks were ""the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy sector in recent times. The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale disruption of the country's energy system.""

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

( Image Source :Microsoft )

Microsoft has recently unveiled Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for business. The tech giant has embarked on what it has dubbed the ""year of the AI PC"" with the launch of these two devices. Both are the first in the Surface lineup to be engineered specifically for the corporate sector. The devices boast a dedicated Copilot button for AI assistance, integration of Intel's latest Core Ultra processors, and a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to optimise AI-driven tasks within Windows 11. These features among many others position them as the pioneering AI-enabled PCs for the professional market.

Microsoft Surface Pro 10, Microsoft Surface Laptop 6: Price & Availability

Microsoft Surface Pro 10 is customisable, however, the configuration options are extensive. It will offer up to 64GB of RAM and a starting point of 8GB, along with a 256GB Gen4 SSD. The base model is priced at $1,199 (Rs 1,66,620).

Microsoft Surface Laptop 6's price for the base model also starts from $1,199. It also offers the same customisation options as Surface Pro 10.

Microsoft's emphasis on catering to the business sector is apparent in the exclusivity of these devices, which can be obtained solely through its commercial channels and authorised resellers.

Nevertheless, consumers interested in acquiring them may still do so indirectly. Microsoft reaffirms its dedication to consumer products, with intentions to introduce consumer versions of these devices during a dedicated event focusing on Windows and Surface AI innovations.

Microsoft Surface Pro 10: Specifications & Features

The Surface Pro 10 for Business has undergone improvements in its display, featuring an anti-reflective coating and increased brightness. However, it opts for a high-quality LCD instead of OLED technology, despite speculation about an OLED model. Microsoft confirmed this decision but hinted at future announcements without providing specific details.

In terms of design, the Surface Pro 10 for Business closely resembles its predecessor, the Surface Pro 9. However, it introduces upgraded internal components, offering a choice between Intel Core Ultra 5 135U and Core Ultra 7 165U processors.

Microsoft has also enhanced connectivity options, incorporating two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, and boasts an impressive battery life of up to 19 hours.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 6: Specifications & Features

The 15-inch variant offers enhanced connectivity with the inclusion of two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, adding versatility for professional applications. It is equipped with Intel's Core Ultra H-series processors, designed to provide powerful desktop-level performance in a compact and portable design.

Customers have the option to select either the 13.5-inch or 15-inch PixelSense touchscreen displays, ensuring clear visuals regardless of the lighting conditions. These displays incorporate anti-reflective and adaptive colour technologies, minimising glare and improving visibility.

Moreover, the 15-inch Surface Laptop 6 includes an integrated smart card reader, catering specifically to high-security sectors by enabling password-less authentication with NFC security keys.",news.abplive.com,news,english,,0.07450980392156858,448792566,1,https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/03/22/c30257be2a9e0edf572fedd271b755401711096303698555_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640,eng-9415704

The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics is already having a profound impact on the insurance indsutry.

Meanwhile, it is well known that our industry is facing a skills and talent gap - experienced professionals are leaving the workforce and they're not being replaced.

However, what we have found is that, when AI is applied to key underwriting and claims processes, you can replicate the expertise of underwriters and claims professionals at scale.

Furthermore, by sharing that knowledge and having AI work in tandem with current employees, you significantly augment their ability to make the best decisions as quickly, accurately and fairly as possible.

From a business model perspective, we know that the industry continues to face a combined ratio problem. Simply raising premiums is not enough to solve the challenge.

Here, AI allows insurers to inject significant efficiency into key processes, such as fraud detection or underwriting.

Finding more fraud is good for the business. Keeping a clean book of business is good for insurers. Shaving points off the combined ratio and helping drive profitability is definitely good for business.

Data plays a crucial role in every business.

Insurance companies require professionals who can extract valuable insights from data to make well informed decisions.

As a result, there is a growing need for employees who possess the necessary skills to effectively analyse and interpret large amounts of data.

From a business perspective, data analytics allows insurance companies to assess risks more accurately by analysing vast quantities of data.

This process helps identify patterns, trends and correlations that assist in predicting and managing risks. Insurers can develop more precise underwriting and pricing models, which in turn reduces potential losses and improves profitability.

Historically, data analyst roles have been more prevalent in the actuarial and underwriting divisions. The depth and breadth of the data now being captured and made available, means the opportunities for more insightful analysis for actuaries and underwriters has dramatically evolved.

It also means there are heightened opportunities in the claims and risk consulting space to utilise data analysts more effectively, which increase their desirability and creates more competition for this skill set.

It also transforms business models by enabling enhanced risk assessment, personalised offerings, fraud detection and operational efficiency.

While technology empowers professionals to navigate claims efficiently, maintaining the human touch of empathy and communication is crucial in building trust and providing market-leading risk insight and management tools to help businesses succeed.

The growing integration of data analytics in the insurance industry has had significant implications for the war for talent and insurer business models.

In today's fiercely competitive job market, data science stands out as one of the most sought-after career paths, drawing in top talent like never before.

As a result, insurance companies are vying to attract and retain skilled data scientists who can leverage analytics to drive innovation and competitive advantage.

Moreover, the prominence of data science underscores the critical role of data in refining insurance business models.

As the demand for data intensifies, regulatory oversight on data usage pose challenges. Nonetheless, access to vast pools of data is indispensable for developing robust models that accurately assess risk and enable personalised services.

Consequently, insurers are increasingly turning to external data sources and advanced analytics to strengthen their data capabilities.

The convergence of talent acquisition challenges and the imperative for sophisticated data driven models underscores the pivotal role of data analytics in shaping the future of the insurance industry.

As companies navigate the complexities of sourcing talent and managing data resources within regulatory frameworks, those adept at leveraging analytics effectively are poised to thrive in an evolving landscape of risk management and customer engagement.

More and more firms are seeking the competitive advantage that is on offer by leveraging data effectively.

There is an increased reliance on data to drive decision making, personalise client experiences and identify opportunities to streamline business operations.

This surge in demand has fuelled the market for individuals that can analyse data to drive practical utility.

Careers in data analytics, data science and technology are very much en vogue and the growing appetite within insurance provides a fantastic opportunity to attract new talent with fresh perspectives and ideas into the sector.

Meanwhile, strategic adjustments can be made to service models and processes that allow firms to get on the front foot and ensure clients are serviced in the most proactive yet cost effective way possible.

By harnessing data, firms are better equipped to personalise the services they offer, find the best propositions on the market, assess risks and tailor products - even predicting what products a client may need before they ask.

However, the rise of data doesn't spell the end of traditional service models.

Instead, it represents an opportunity to deliver hyper-personalised experiences that bring relationships to a new and more powerful level.

It's no secret that the talent shortage in insurance is affecting all areas of the market - and implementing new technologies is one way of tackling the issue.

Reducing time spent on administrative tasks can improve our appeal in the job market and our business models.

It allows our teams and potential candidates to focus on upskilling in areas that make a difference to their performance and career path.

From a business perspective, greater integration of data allows our teams to better understand our customers' needs and improve products and services.

For exmaple, at Axa UK, we have launched the data academy to upskill our employees across all divisions of the business, from underwriting and claims, risk and compliance to human resources and finance.

The aim of the academy is to help our colleagues develop a broader understanding of what it means to embrace data and AI as part of their roles.

The academy will also help us develop our existing talent and attract new talent to Axa, with the ability to grow a career within data here.

We are currently exploring how we can leverage data and AI to minimise the time our teams spend on labour intensive activities.

For example, our cyber team is utilising AI tools to analyse vulnerabilities more quickly and on a larger scale to help them identify priorities and provide a better defence strategy against threats.

Insurers have historically been limited in their ability to gather customer data due to the heavily disintermediated nature of the industry.

However, the rise of new technologies such as wearables, IoT, telematics and third-party data providers presents a unique opportunity for insurers to gain a deep understanding of their customers' behaviour and preferences.

The caveat is only those who can effectively compete for scarce, highly specialised data talent will be able to take full advantage of the opportunity.

The new generation of low-code or no-code insurance platforms can play an important role by levelling the playing field and making it easy for business teams to access, unify and leverage data to personalise pricing and propositions.",insurancetimes.co.uk,news,Insurance Times,Chantal Kapani,0.2941176470588236,448792148,1,https://d17mj6xr9uykrr.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/0/2/2/108022_data-science-Sun-Life.jpg,eng-9409721

The attacks caused a fire at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which supplies electricity to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power installation.

The main 750-kilovolt power line to the plant was cut off, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. A lower-power backup line was working, he said.

The plant is occupied by Russian troops, and fighting around the plant has been a constant concern because of the potential for a nuclear accident.

The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but would potentially cause severe flooding similar to what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper collapsed.

Attacks on energy facilities in the Kharkiv region caused blackouts, and other attacks were reported in areas of western Ukraine far from the front lines.

This shift introduces new challenges and tensions as established product development practices need to be complemented with new digital service development practices. In the specific context of incumbent manufacturing firms developing integrated solutions of products and digital services, this thesis investigates the integration of product and digital service development practices and related technologies. The findings show that the implementation of common agile development cycles, including the identification of solution patterns of components, creates an integration of development practices across technology domains. Furthermore, by integrating a dynamic sourcing process to the agile practices, a new relationship development path with external firms is formed that contradicts previous practice and theory. In the dynamic sourcing process, the relationship develops from an early limited exploration of opportunities to a focus on operational efficiency when delivering products and services at scale. A successful integration of development practices (know-how) and technologies is crucial for organizational learning and the long-term survival of firms. To further theorize the evolution of knowledge and know-how, the thesis proposes a framework for a language-based view of firms where alphabets and grammar include any physical or non-physical representation of knowledge.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.223529411764706,448791242,1,,

It appeared to be the biggest strike of the war against Ukraine's energy network, with the internet down and domestic and industrial electricity supplies hit nationwide.

Dramatic footage shows the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant - Ukraine's largest - erupting in flames following a strike there which also hit a bus, causing several civilian casualties. The dam - part of the hydro facility - apparently remained intact but the turbine chamber and sluice equipment were damaged. 'The fire at the station continues,' said the Ukrhydroenergo power company. 'Emergency services and energy workers are working on the spot, overcoming the consequences of numerous airstrikes.'

Residents in second city Kharkiv suffered water and power outages overnight and the city's Transport Engineering Plant, a vital facility that produces and repairs tanks, was also hit in some of the strongest bombardments of the war so far. Russian Telegram channel War Gonzo branded it 'judgement night and morning' - and the brutal strikes followed closely after Putin 's victory in the Russian presidential election which he sees as a mandate for continuing his invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this week he had vowed vengeance for what he saw as Ukrainian strikes on civilians in Russia's Belgorod region. He said: 'We can respond in the same way. [We can hit] civilian infrastructure and all other objects of this kind that the enemy attacks.' For the second day in succession, NATO war planes in Poland were scrambled due to 'the activity of Russian long-range aviation', monitoring the Russian aircraft's flight path to ensure they did not threaten alliance territory. Thirteen Tu-95MS aircraft - part of Putin's nuclear armoury but using conventional missiles - struck at various targets across Ukraine.

With air defences overwhelmed by these planes and missiles, Russia also attacked with kamikaze drones. Explosions were recorded in Kanatovo, near Kirovograd, a reserve air base of the Ukrainian Air Force, as well as Kremenchuk, Burshtyn, Khmelnitsky Odesa, Zhytomyr, and Vinnytsia. A large local hydroelectric power station was completely out of order in Ladyzhyn, Vinnytsia region, according to mayor Serhiy Borzov.

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was the largest attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the recent past. 'The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale failure of the country's energy system,' he wrote on Facebook. Local officials in Zaporizhzhia reported there were 12 missile strikes there which destroyed seven houses and damaged around 35. Russian war correspondent Roman Alekhin said of strikes on power facilities: 'This is a warning for the future.'

About 15 blasts were heard in Kharkiv early this morning, mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that said some of the city's water pumps had stopped because of the attacks. In central Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said blasts were heard in the city, but provided no details. Citizens across Ukraine were forced to shelter from the attacks with thousands piling into Kyiv's metro system. The number of casualties has not yet been established. It comes as a contingent of Ukrainian pilots completed a British flight training programme as part of efforts to bolster Ukraine's air force.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, the chief of the air staff, said 'Ukraine must prevail, your victory is our victory', as he paid tribute to the skills and motivation of the 10 young pilots at a ceremony on Thursday. The 10 pilots received basic flying, ground school and language training in the UK and they will now move to advanced flying training provided by the French Air Force before learning to fly F-16 fighter jets, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. Sir Richard told the pilots at a UK air base: 'From our own history in the United Kingdom, we understand perhaps more than most how powerful the few can be against the many,' referencing the heroic efforts of the RAF against the German Luftwaffe in World War II.

He told them: 'It's never been more important for us to stand shoulder to shoulder to counter the aggression of those who seek to undermine our freedoms, our liberty, our stability and the security of the international system, standing up against those who think that might-is-right and they can do as they wish. 'We cannot and will not allow that.' Sir Richard added: 'Your conflict is our conflict. Ukraine must prevail, your victory is our victory.' He said: 'It's been an honour for us to host you and train you here in the UK. 'The bond between us - our United Kingdom and Ukraine - is strong and I hope that it will go from strength to strength for as long as it takes.'

The third edition of Central University Entrance Test - Undergraduate (CUET-UG) for admission to central universities will see a slew of changes in its exam schedule for a smooth and swift run to avoid the delays that marked last year's exercise.

The CUET-UG will be held between May 15 and May 31 this year, the National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts the exam across the country, had announced earlier this year. Applications for the same opened on February 27 and the last date for submitting them will be March 26.

With record applications last year, CUET-UG became the second largest entrance exam in India after NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test), which is conducted for admission to medical colleges.

According to University Grants Commission (UGC), the higher education regulator, so far 46 central universities, 32 state universities, 20 deemed-to-be-universities, 98 private universities and 6 government institutions have registered for accepting CUET-UG scores for their admission to under-graduate (UG) programmes.

OMR Mode For Papers With High Registrations

""More are joining,"" said UGC chief Prof M Jagadesh Kumar, adding, ""this year, since we will conduct this CUET-UG in hybrid mode, all papers with large registrations will be conducted in OMR mode (pen and paper mode). This will help us use schools and colleges as test centres instead of looking for only computer centres. Therefore, it is not likely to be difficult to arrange test centres nationwide, which had been an issue earlier.""

Since the launch of CUET-UG, it has been conducted in 'Computer-Based Test' (CBT) mode. This is the first time since the entrance exam was rolled out that it will be conducted in both pen and paper as well as computer-based mode.

""For all the papers with fewer registrations, we will use the CBT mode,"" he added.

According to NTA officials, this year, it won't be a problem identifying test centres, as they already have the list of centres where NEET is conducted every year.

Last year, the results of the exam were announced in July, which the NTA said, will most likely be done by June this year.

Glitches in First, Delays Marred Second Edition

The first edition of CUET was marred by both technical and administrative glitches that had prompted the NTA to cancel the exam and reschedule it later at multiple occasions.

Last year, though better prepared to handle technical glitches, the exam was held in seven phases and was delayed by more than a week, against its given schedule, to accommodate all the registered applicants. This was mainly because it was difficult to identify test centres in several parts of the country, which had to be computer-equipped facilities for holding the exam, resulting in a long-drawn exercise.

According to NTA data, last year, out of 14.99 lakh students who registered for the exam, 11.16 lakh took the test.

Even as the overall number of applications for the second edition of CUET-UG was an unprecedented 14.99 lakh, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Jharkhand and the whole of Northeast together comprised for the highest number of applications for the exam. At least 17.74% of all the students who had applied for the exam were from J&K and Jharkhand alone, prompting issues in identifying accessible and well-equipped test centres. Many candidates in these regions were allotted centres in the nearby cities.

Students Can Attempt Up To Six Papers

""This year, instead of attempting 10 papers, students will be permitted to write a maximum of 6 papers. The rationale behind this decision is that only a tiny percentage of students have opted for ten papers in the last year's test. However, the scheduling of papers becomes very complex, leading to conducting the test over several days,"" said Kumar.

This year, he added, since students can write six papers in different combinations, such as four domain papers, one language paper, one general test paper or three domain papers, two language papers and one general test paper, CUET-UG can be scheduled over fewer days, which is good for the students.

Until now, students were allowed to pick 10 subjects to write the exam, which led to issues such as students having to write multiple exams on a single day without a break, taking a toll on them.

This year, an NTA official said, there will be ""sufficient gap"" between two papers on the same day for any candidate appearing for more than one subject on the same day. ""The exam will be conducted in two or three shifts in a day depending on the number of candidates in a given area like last year,"" the official said.

As seen over the last two years, the most popular subjects which have had the highest number of registrations include languages, which is topped by English, followed by Hindu and Urdu. The other popular subjects include biology, economics, accounting, mathematics and history, among others.

'Trust Your Preparation, Avoid Coaching': UGC Chief's Message to Students

In his message to students preparing for CUET-UG, Kumar said, ""Focus on consistent, balanced study routines; and prioritise self-care with breaks and relaxation techniques. Remain positive and trust in your preparation.""

Since the launch of the common entrance test for admission to central universities, a large number of students have been opting for private coaching to prepare for the same. A number of coaching centres have started offering CUET-UG prep courses.

However, Kumar said that with consistent study schedules, students can prepare for the test on their own without the need for any external help. ""Students need to know their class XII syllabus and concepts to the best while the level of difficulty in the entrance exam is going to be moderate,"" he added.",news18.com,news,News18,,0.1058823529411765,448790839,1,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/03/cuet-ug-2024-03-c3e4d51387ec7e3d6fcce063fe072ba5-16x9.jpeg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675,eng-9413001

It investigates how modifications in structure, process variables, and composition can enhance functional properties. It employs advanced characterization techniques to analyze process-structure-property relationships and utilizes innovative colloidal processing approaches such as controlled nanoparticle incorporation, Layer-by-Layer self-assembly, and unidirectional ice-templating to improve the functional properties of wood-based nanomaterials.A novel approach has been developed to fabricate lightweight, highly porous hybrid foams using iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) and TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF). The addition of tannic acid (TA) and the application of a magnetic field-enhanced unidirectional ice-templating technique (MFUIT) enhanced processability, mechanical, and magnetic characteristics of the foams. The hybrid foam containing 87% IONPs exhibited a saturation magnetization of 83.2 emu g-1, which is equivalent to 95% of the magnetization value observed in bulk magnetite.Hybrid, anisotropic foams have been prepared by incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto the macropore-walls of anisotropic TOCNF foams using a liquid-phase Layer-by-Layer self-assembly method. These hierarchical rGO-TOCNF foams exhibit lower radial thermal conductivity (λr) across a wide range of relative humidity compared to control TOCNF foams.The shear-induced orientations and relaxations of multi-component dispersions containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and montmorillonite nanoplatelets (MNT) have been studied by rheological small-angle X-ray scattering (Rheo-SAXS). The addition of MNT resulted in gelation and changes in flow behavior, shear responses, and relaxation dynamics. Rheo-SAXS measurements showed that CNC and MNT aligned under shear, creating aligned structures that relaxed upon shear removal. Gaining insights into shear-induced orientations and relaxation dynamics can aid in the development of advanced wood-based nanocomposite materials.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) derived from abundant lignin waste. TEM analysis revealed that the OLNPs had a spherical shape and a core-shell structure. Upon drying, the particles tended to agglomerate due to the loss of electrostatic repulsion forces. This agglomeration behavior indirectly supports the hypothesis that oleate chains act as a hydration barrier, preventing water permeation into the particles. Finally, a comprehensive study showed that TEMPO-oxidized lignocellulose nanofibers (TOLCNF)-based foams made from unbleached pulp can be used to prepare anisotropic, light-weight ice-templated foams with high mechanical strength. TOLCNF foams utilize lignin and hemicellulose to enhance properties while require less energy for production compared to TOCNF-based foams. This study emphasizes the potential for developing sustainable wood-based nanomaterials using TOLCNF.The results presented in this thesis offer valuable insights for further advancements of wood-based nanomaterials.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.192156862745098,448790837,1,,

New Delhi [India], March 22: In the dynamic world of fitness, where new trends emerge almost as quickly as you can do a burpee, one approach is gaining traction for its transformative results: Hybrid Training. This cutting-edge fitness methodology seamlessly blends the best of two worlds - Calisthenics and Weightlifting. As we all work towards our goal of well-rounded, holistic fitness, this hybrid approach offers a unique and effective way to achieve strength, flexibility, and aesthetic goals. In this blog, we take a plunge into the different elements of Hybrid Training Techniques and explore how the combining calisthenics with weightlifting can help unlock a fitter, stronger, and more agile version of yourself.

Understanding Hybrid Training Techniques

Hybrid Training, in essence, is a holistic approach that combines different forms of exercise to create a comprehensive workout regimen. The fusion of Calisthenics and Weightlifting is a power-packed blend that focuses both bodyweight and resistance training. Calisthenics primarily involves using your body weight for resistance, while Weightlifting employs external loads to build strength. When these two come together, you can experience the benefits of functional movement, witness muscular development, and improve your overall fitness.

Calisthenics: The Foundation of Bodyweight Mastery

Calisthenics, rooted in ancient Greek training methods, relies on utilizing your own body weight to build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Calisthenics routines usually include bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. These exercises along with working on multiple muscles, also improve coordination, balance, and your sense of equilibrium.

Fitness enthusiasts who embrace calisthenics often rave about the freedom it offers - no fancy gym equipment is required, making it an accessible choice for those who prefer outdoor workouts or have limited access to a gym. The best part about calisthenics is its adaptability; you can tailor the workouts to accommodate a range of fitness levels, making it suitable for beginners and seasoned athletes alike.

Weightlifting: Harnessing the Power of External Resistance

On the other end of the spectrum, Weightlifting involves the use of external resistance, typically in the form of barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells. This form of training is renowned for its ability to build raw strength and muscle mass. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously, fostering overall muscle development.

Weightlifting is often associated with the stereotypical image of a muscle-bound bodybuilder in a gym filled with clanging weights. However, the benefits outweigh this perception of aesthetics. Regular weightlifting enhances bone density, metabolism, and functional strength, making it an integral component of any well-rounded fitness routine.

The Synergy of Calisthenics and Weightlifting

Now, imagine combining the fluidity and grace of calisthenics with the raw power and muscle engagement of weightlifting. This is how the magic of Hybrid Training Techniques comes alive. The synergy of these two approaches addresses the limitations of each and accentuates the strengths, resulting in a holistic fitness experience.

It appeared to be the biggest strike of the war against Ukraine's energy network, with the internet down and domestic and industrial electricity supplies hit nationwide.

Dramatic footage shows the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant - Ukraine's largest - erupting in flames following a strike there which also hit a bus, causing several civilian casualties.

The dam - part of the hydro facility - apparently remained intact but the turbine chamber and sluice equipment were damaged.

'The fire at the station continues,' said the Ukrhydroenergo power company. 'Emergency services and energy workers are working on the spot, overcoming the consequences of numerous airstrikes.'

Residents in second city Kharkiv suffered water and power outages overnight and the city's Transport Engineering Plant, a vital facility that produces and repairs tanks, was also hit in some of the strongest bombardments of the war so far.

Russian Telegram channel War Gonzo branded it 'judgement night and morning' - and the brutal strikes followed closely after Putin's victory in the Russian presidential election which he sees as a mandate for continuing his invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this week he had vowed vengeance for what he saw as Ukrainian strikes on civilians in Russia's Belgorod region.

He said: 'We can respond in the same way. [We can hit] civilian infrastructure and all other objects of this kind that the enemy attacks.'

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was the largest attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the recent past

For the second day in succession, NATO war planes in Poland were scrambled due to 'the activity of Russian long-range aviation', monitoring the Russian aircraft's flight path to ensure they did not threaten alliance territory.

Thirteen Tu-95MS aircraft - part of Putin's nuclear armoury but using conventional missiles - struck at various targets across Ukraine.

With air defences overwhelmed by these planes and missiles, Russia also attacked with kamikaze drones.

Explosions were recorded in Kanatovo, near Kirovograd, a reserve air base of the Ukrainian Air Force, as well as Kremenchuk, Burshtyn, Khmelnitsky Odesa, Zhytomyr, and Vinnytsia.

A large local hydroelectric power station was completely out of order in Ladyzhyn, Vinnytsia region, according to mayor Serhiy Borzov.

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was the largest attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the recent past.

'The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale failure of the country's energy system,' he wrote on Facebook.

Local officials in Zaporizhzhia reported there were 12 missile strikes there which destroyed seven houses and damaged around 35.

Russian war correspondent Roman Alekhin said of strikes on power facilities: 'This is a warning for the future.'

About 15 blasts were heard in Kharkiv early this morning, mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that said some of the city's water pumps had stopped because of the attacks.

In central Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said blasts were heard in the city, but provided no details.

Citizens across Ukraine were forced to shelter from the attacks with thousands piling into Kyiv's metro system.

The number of casualties has not yet been established.

It comes as a contingent of Ukrainian pilots completed a British flight training programme as part of efforts to bolster Ukraine's air force.

Ukrainian fast jet pilots at the High-G training and test facility at RAF Cranwell

Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, the chief of the air staff, said 'Ukraine must prevail, your victory is our victory', as he paid tribute to the skills and motivation of the 10 young pilots at a ceremony on Thursday.

The 10 pilots received basic flying, ground school and language training in the UK and they will now move to advanced flying training provided by the French Air Force before learning to fly F-16 fighter jets, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.

Sir Richard told the pilots at a UK air base: 'From our own history in the United Kingdom, we understand perhaps more than most how powerful the few can be against the many,' referencing the heroic efforts of the RAF against the German Luftwaffe in World War II.

He told them: 'It's never been more important for us to stand shoulder to shoulder to counter the aggression of those who seek to undermine our freedoms, our liberty, our stability and the security of the international system, standing up against those who think that might-is-right and they can do as they wish.

'We cannot and will not allow that.'

Sir Richard added: 'Your conflict is our conflict. Ukraine must prevail, your victory is our victory.'

He said: 'It's been an honour for us to host you and train you here in the UK.

'The bond between us - our United Kingdom and Ukraine - is strong and I hope that it will go from strength to strength for as long as it takes.'

New Delhi [India], March 22: In the dynamic world of fitness, where new trends emerge almost as quickly as you can do a burpee, one approach is gaining traction for its transformative results: Hybrid Training. This cutting-edge fitness methodology seamlessly blends the best of two worlds - Calisthenics and Weightlifting. As we all work towards our goal of well-rounded, holistic fitness, this hybrid approach offers a unique and effective way to achieve strength, flexibility, and aesthetic goals. In this blog, we take a plunge into the different elements of Hybrid Training Techniques and explore how the combining calisthenics with weightlifting can help unlock a fitter, stronger, and more agile version of yourself.

Understanding Hybrid Training Techniques

Hybrid Training, in essence, is a holistic approach that combines different forms of exercise to create a comprehensive workout regimen. The fusion of Calisthenics and Weightlifting is a power-packed blend that focuses both bodyweight and resistance training. Calisthenics primarily involves using your body weight for resistance, while Weightlifting employs external loads to build strength. When these two come together, you can experience the benefits of functional movement, witness muscular development, and improve your overall fitness.

Calisthenics: The Foundation of Bodyweight Mastery

Calisthenics, rooted in ancient Greek training methods, relies on utilizing your own body weight to build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Calisthenics routines usually include bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. These exercises along with working on multiple muscles, also improve coordination, balance, and your sense of equilibrium.

Fitness enthusiasts who embrace calisthenics often rave about the freedom it offers - no fancy gym equipment is required, making it an accessible choice for those who prefer outdoor workouts or have limited access to a gym. The best part about calisthenics is its adaptability; you can tailor the workouts to accommodate a range of fitness levels, making it suitable for beginners and seasoned athletes alike.

Weightlifting: Harnessing the Power of External Resistance

On the other end of the spectrum, Weightlifting involves the use of external resistance, typically in the form of barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells. This form of training is renowned for its ability to build raw strength and muscle mass. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously, fostering overall muscle development.

Weightlifting is often associated with the stereotypical image of a muscle-bound bodybuilder in a gym filled with clanging weights. However, the benefits outweigh this perception of aesthetics. Regular weightlifting enhances bone density, metabolism, and functional strength, making it an integral component of any well-rounded fitness routine.

The Synergy of Calisthenics and Weightlifting

Now, imagine combining the fluidity and grace of calisthenics with the raw power and muscle engagement of weightlifting. This is how the magic of Hybrid Training Techniques comes alive. The synergy of these two approaches addresses the limitations of each and accentuates the strengths, resulting in a holistic fitness experience.

1. Improved Strength and Muscle Balance:

Calisthenics excels in promoting bodyweight mastery and control, while weightlifting emphasizes building strength through external resistance. By integrating both in your routine, you create a balance that makes sure all muscles are efficiently targeted. This balance not only prevents muscle imbalances but also enhances functional strength, allowing you to perform daily activities with ease.

2. Versatility in Training:

One of the key advantages of hybrid training is the versatility it offers. Transition seamlessly between bodyweight exercises and weightlifting, creating an energetic and engaging workout routine. This versatility keeps your workouts fresh, preventing boredom and plateauing, which often occurs with repetitive training methods.

3. Enhanced Cardiovascular Fitness:

Calisthenics, with its emphasis on continuous, rhythmic movements, naturally incorporates cardiovascular elements into your workout. When paired with the intensity of weightlifting, the cardiovascular system is further challenged. The result? An effective and time-efficient workout that builds strength and improves cardiovascular fitness.

How Can a Fitness Coach Help in Hybrid Training?

Kickstarting the hybrid training journey can seem daunting, especially if you are new to both calisthenics and weightlifting. This is where the expertise of a fitness coach becomes invaluable. A qualified coach can assess your current fitness level, goals, and preferences to design a personalized hybrid training program.

A coach acts as a guide, ensuring proper form, progression, and recovery. They can help you navigate the challenges of combining calisthenics and weightlifting, making sure you get the most out of your workouts and achieve your desired fitness goals. Additionally, having a coach provides the accountability and motivation needed to stay consistent on your fitness journey.

In Conclusion

In the ever-changing and evolving world of fitness, where trying new things is the norm, combining calisthenics and weightlifting is a game-changer. This dynamic duo can add tons of benefits to your overall fitness, like enhancing your strength, balancing muscles, and improving your heart health. It doesn't matter if you're a fitness pro or just a beginner - the flexibility and effectiveness of hybrid training makes it a no-brainer.

As you dive into your hybrid training adventure, think about teaming up with a fitness coach. They're like your personal guide, making sure you nail the moves and fine-tune your plan to fit your goals. Plus, having a coach keeps you on track and fired up for your fitness journey.

In the fitness world, where being inventive is key, hybrid training shines as a superstar. Why settle for boring workouts when you can enjoy the best of both worlds? Unleash your inner fitness champion with the awesome combo of calisthenics and weightlifting - the ultimate recipe for a stronger, fitter, and more resilient version of yourself.

It appeared to be the biggest strike of the war against Ukraine's energy network, with the internet down and domestic and industrial electricity supplies hit nationwide.

Dramatic footage shows the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant - Ukraine's largest - erupting in flames following a strike there which also hit a bus, causing several civilian casualties.

The dam - part of the hydro facility - apparently remained intact but the turbine chamber and sluice equipment were damaged.

'The fire at the station continues,' said the Ukrhydroenergo power company. 'Emergency services and energy workers are working on the spot, overcoming the consequences of numerous airstrikes.'

Residents in second city Kharkiv suffered water and power outages overnight and the city's Transport Engineering Plant, a vital facility that produces and repairs tanks, was also hit in some of the strongest bombardments of the war so far.

Russian Telegram channel War Gonzo branded it 'judgement night and morning' - and the brutal strikes followed closely after Putin's victory in the Russian presidential election which he sees as a mandate for continuing his invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this week he had vowed vengeance for what he saw as Ukrainian strikes on civilians in Russia's Belgorod region.

He said: 'We can respond in the same way. [We can hit] civilian infrastructure and all other objects of this kind that the enemy attacks.'

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was the largest attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the recent past

For the second day in succession, NATO war planes in Poland were scrambled due to 'the activity of Russian long-range aviation', monitoring the Russian aircraft's flight path to ensure they did not threaten alliance territory.

Thirteen Tu-95MS aircraft - part of Putin's nuclear armoury but using conventional missiles - struck at various targets across Ukraine.

With air defences overwhelmed by these planes and missiles, Russia also attacked with kamikaze drones.

Explosions were recorded in Kanatovo, near Kirovograd, a reserve air base of the Ukrainian Air Force, as well as Kremenchuk, Burshtyn, Khmelnitsky Odesa, Zhytomyr, and Vinnytsia.

A large local hydroelectric power station was completely out of order in Ladyzhyn, Vinnytsia region, according to mayor Serhiy Borzov.

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was the largest attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in the recent past.

'The goal is not just to damage, but to try again, like last year, to cause a large-scale failure of the country's energy system,' he wrote on Facebook.

Local officials in Zaporizhzhia reported there were 12 missile strikes there which destroyed seven houses and damaged around 35.

Russian war correspondent Roman Alekhin said of strikes on power facilities: 'This is a warning for the future.'

About 15 blasts were heard in Kharkiv early this morning, mayor Ihor Terekhov said, adding that said some of the city's water pumps had stopped because of the attacks.

In central Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said blasts were heard in the city, but provided no details.

Citizens across Ukraine were forced to shelter from the attacks with thousands piling into Kyiv's metro system.

The number of casualties has not yet been established.

It comes as a contingent of Ukrainian pilots completed a British flight training programme as part of efforts to bolster Ukraine's air force.

Ukrainian fast jet pilots at the High-G training and test facility at RAF Cranwell

Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, the chief of the air staff, said 'Ukraine must prevail, your victory is our victory', as he paid tribute to the skills and motivation of the 10 young pilots at a ceremony on Thursday.

The 10 pilots received basic flying, ground school and language training in the UK and they will now move to advanced flying training provided by the French Air Force before learning to fly F-16 fighter jets, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.

Sir Richard told the pilots at a UK air base: 'From our own history in the United Kingdom, we understand perhaps more than most how powerful the few can be against the many,' referencing the heroic efforts of the RAF against the German Luftwaffe in World War II.

He told them: 'It's never been more important for us to stand shoulder to shoulder to counter the aggression of those who seek to undermine our freedoms, our liberty, our stability and the security of the international system, standing up against those who think that might-is-right and they can do as they wish.

Budding builders from the Ofsted-outstanding Barnsley College Construction Centre were given some hands-on training from insulation specialists from Actis, learning about thermal bridging, airtightness, U and R values.

The Barnsley College Construction Centre offers T-levels and apprenticeships in various professions including bricklaying, tiling, plumbing, plastering, joinery, decorating, carpentry and surveying as well as HNDs and HNCs in Modern Methods of Construction.

Regional specification manager Amaret Chahal was invited to speak to the 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds courtesy of Louise Wagstaff, a former Actis colleague who now works for Howarth Timber in Wakefield - and is keen to spread the message about the merits of reflective insulation.

Amaret's role was both academic and hands on, with the students reinforcing their learning about energy efficiency before measuring, cutting and installing Actis honeycomb style insulation Hybris into stud walls in the dedicated timber frame workshop.

Amaret, who before joining Actis taught in schools as part of her English literature and education studies degree, also co-wrote one of the Actis CPD modules.

She explained: ""The students already knew about other forms of insulation and wanted to learn about reflective insulation too to broaden their knowledge. The Construction Centre is excellent and one of only a few in the country with an outstanding Ofsted report. ""

""We hope to be able to return during 'Skill Build Week' to help the students when they create both a mini timber framed building and a full-size one in their workshop, which will see them develop a structure to meet Passivhaus standards.""",pbctoday.co.uk,news,"Planning, BIM & Construction Today",Harriet Clough,0.3098039215686275,448789285,1,https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/barnsley-installing.jpeg,eng-9412353

Add eco-friendly features for a sustainable, off-grid lifestyle, and you have the perfect tiny home. 18 photosPhoto: Wayfarer Tiny Homes Australians do it better - this phenomenal tiny house has it all in terms of design, functionality, and self-sufficiency. At first glance, you might think this is only a spacious, modern tiny with a sophisticated interior style. As impressive as that is, there's so much more behind its beautiful façade.

First and foremost, the flagship model developed by Wayfarer Tiny Homes was built for maximum strength and durability. It may look dainty and glamorous, but this abode is meant to pass the Australian climate test successfully. Instead of the common dual-axle trailers that most tiny houses sit on, this house boasts a custom steel skid base with so-called ""earth anchor"" tie-downs for C4 cyclonic wind rating.

The heavy use of 100% recyclable structural concrete elements adds resistance to termites and damage, as well as a low-burn fire rating. The Wayfarer Tiny was designed for a rugged, fully independent lifestyle, even in challenging natural environments. A composting toilet is not only better for the environment than a regular one, but it is also a way of cutting expenses by using much less water. Additionally, all the water resulting from household activities is processed separately in the most effective way.

Photo: Wayfarer Tiny Homes Water from the bathroom and laundry area is processed on-site thanks to an Australian-made greywater treatment system. The kitchen wastewater is purified through a two-step process and can be reutilized for the owner's garden or lawn or simply released back into nature.

The home's spectacular and unique-looking glass façade is not just for show but another clever way to maximize efficiency in harmony with nature. During the cold season, the huge glass panels enable passive solar heating; when the weather gets warm, the transom windows at the second-story level create cross-ventilation for what is known as convective cooling.

An LPG-powered hot water system ensures the highest level of comfort in any environment. For efficiency and safety, all the equipment in the utility shed is integrated into the skid base, which is also weather-proof. At the same time, this rugged Aussie abode comes with all the hook-ups for conventional power, water, and cable, which makes it even more versatile.

The exceptional design transforms a basic dual-loft layout with an open-space main floor into an ultra-modern living space with over-the-top functionality. There's no standard, enclosed bedroom on the main floor, yet a cleverly hidden pop-out bed instantly transforms into a luxurious bedroom.

Photo: Wayfarer Tiny Homes A smart, multi-functional configuration provides a lounge/dining setup during the day and a cozy bedtime setup at night. A drop-down dining table with plush seating on both sides becomes a comfortable, welcoming solution for enjoying meals while taking in the stunning panoramic views. It's also flanked by impressive sets of built-in shelves that go almost all the way to the top and cabinets with multiple drawers underneath.

This translates to abundant storage that helps keep everything well-organized and pristine-looking. To top things off, a pull-out desk with multiple power points and USB plug-ins turns this into a perfectly-equipped home office. As you can see, this front section of the house is a three-in-one living space that truly redefines versatility.

A queen-sized, wall-mounted bed also hides behind this multi-functional wall. At night, it instantly turns this area into an open-style bedroom with fantastic views and easy access. Nearby, you'll also find his-and-hers full-size wardrobes that connect seamlessly with the rest of the storage for a streamlined look.

The loft above the kitchen is meant as a second bedroom with a huge bed and large windows. The opposite loft sitting above the bathroom becomes an elegant, elevated lounge with ample room for a sofa, armchairs, and a coffee table. As you'll notice, there's no staircase for any of the lofts; a simple ladder is available to access both of them. This might be the only inconvenience of this particular setup, but it is a smart way to free up space for the multi-functional front area and add massive storage.

Photo: Wayfarer Tiny Homes Storage also takes center stage in the kitchen and bathroom. Instead of a couple of modest cabinets, these rooms boast full sets of cabinets and additional open shelves for maximum storage capacity. The kitchen is rightfully described as ""chef-inspired"" - it reveals a unique combination of ample storage, elegant Italian appliances, and a modern black-and-white color scheme.

The black tile backsplash instantly elevates this kitchen's style. As for the bathroom, the typical modest vanity was replaced by an elegant countertop with lots of storage underneath and even overhead cabinets. There's enough room for a full-size bathtub and a built-in washing machine, adding even more functionality to this smart home. The same black-and-white color scheme as the kitchen adds modern elegance.

In the end, it's the spectacular floor-to-ceiling window walls that make this Aussie-designed tiny house unforgettable. They're made of polished aluminum extruded frames and 6-mm laminated glass for durability, with a dazzling effect. Together with the vaulted ceilings, this unique façade creates a sense of vast spaciousness and a strong connection to the outdoors. It's all about using the latest technologies to reconnect with nature and minimize our footprint.",autoevolution.com,news,autoevolution,Otilia Drăgan,0.3647058823529412,448788265,1,https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-perfect-off-grid-tiny-home-pulls-out-all-the-stops-for-mind-blowing-functionality-231165_1.jpg,

New Delhi [India], March 22: In the dynamic world of fitness, where new trends emerge almost as quickly as you can do a burpee, one approach is gaining traction for its transformative results: Hybrid Training. This cutting-edge fitness methodology seamlessly blends the best of two worlds - Calisthenics and Weightlifting. As we all work towards our goal of well-rounded, holistic fitness, this hybrid approach offers a unique and effective way to achieve strength, flexibility, and aesthetic goals. In this blog, we take a plunge into the different elements of Hybrid Training Techniques and explore how the combining calisthenics with weightlifting can help unlock a fitter, stronger, and more agile version of yourself.

Understanding Hybrid Training Techniques

Hybrid Training, in essence, is a holistic approach that combines different forms of exercise to create a comprehensive workout regimen. The fusion of Calisthenics and Weightlifting is a power-packed blend that focuses both bodyweight and resistance training. Calisthenics primarily involves using your body weight for resistance, while Weightlifting employs external loads to build strength. When these two come together, you can experience the benefits of functional movement, witness muscular development, and improve your overall fitness.

Calisthenics: The Foundation of Bodyweight Mastery

Calisthenics, rooted in ancient Greek training methods, relies on utilizing your own body weight to build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Calisthenics routines usually include bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. These exercises along with working on multiple muscles, also improve coordination, balance, and your sense of equilibrium.

Fitness enthusiasts who embrace calisthenics often rave about the freedom it offers - no fancy gym equipment is required, making it an accessible choice for those who prefer outdoor workouts or have limited access to a gym. The best part about calisthenics is its adaptability; you can tailor the workouts to accommodate a range of fitness levels, making it suitable for beginners and seasoned athletes alike.

Weightlifting: Harnessing the Power of External Resistance

On the other end of the spectrum, Weightlifting involves the use of external resistance, typically in the form of barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells. This form of training is renowned for its ability to build raw strength and muscle mass. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously, fostering overall muscle development.

Weightlifting is often associated with the stereotypical image of a muscle-bound bodybuilder in a gym filled with clanging weights. However, the benefits outweigh this perception of aesthetics. Regular weightlifting enhances bone density, metabolism, and functional strength, making it an integral component of any well-rounded fitness routine.

The Synergy of Calisthenics and Weightlifting

Now, imagine combining the fluidity and grace of calisthenics with the raw power and muscle engagement of weightlifting. This is how the magic of Hybrid Training Techniques comes alive. The synergy of these two approaches addresses the limitations of each and accentuates the strengths, resulting in a holistic fitness experience.

1. Improved Strength and Muscle Balance:

Calisthenics excels in promoting bodyweight mastery and control, while weightlifting emphasizes building strength through external resistance. By integrating both in your routine, you create a balance that makes sure all muscles are efficiently targeted. This balance not only prevents muscle imbalances but also enhances functional strength, allowing you to perform daily activities with ease.

2. Versatility in Training:

One of the key advantages of hybrid training is the versatility it offers. Transition seamlessly between bodyweight exercises and weightlifting, creating an energetic and engaging workout routine. This versatility keeps your workouts fresh, preventing boredom and plateauing, which often occurs with repetitive training methods.

3. Enhanced Cardiovascular Fitness:

Calisthenics, with its emphasis on continuous, rhythmic movements, naturally incorporates cardiovascular elements into your workout. When paired with the intensity of weightlifting, the cardiovascular system is further challenged. The result? An effective and time-efficient workout that builds strength and improves cardiovascular fitness.

How Can a Fitness Coach Help in Hybrid Training?

Kickstarting the hybrid training journey can seem daunting, especially if you are new to both calisthenics and weightlifting. This is where the expertise of a fitness coach becomes invaluable. A qualified coach can assess your current fitness level, goals, and preferences to design a personalized hybrid training program.

A coach acts as a guide, ensuring proper form, progression, and recovery. They can help you navigate the challenges of combining calisthenics and weightlifting, making sure you get the most out of your workouts and achieve your desired fitness goals. Additionally, having a coach provides the accountability and motivation needed to stay consistent on your fitness journey.

In Conclusion

In the ever-changing and evolving world of fitness, where trying new things is the norm, combining calisthenics and weightlifting is a game-changer. This dynamic duo can add tons of benefits to your overall fitness, like enhancing your strength, balancing muscles, and improving your heart health. It doesn't matter if you're a fitness pro or just a beginner - the flexibility and effectiveness of hybrid training makes it a no-brainer.

As you dive into your hybrid training adventure, think about teaming up with a fitness coach. They're like your personal guide, making sure you nail the moves and fine-tune your plan to fit your goals. Plus, having a coach keeps you on track and fired up for your fitness journey.

In the fitness world, where being inventive is key, hybrid training shines as a superstar. Why settle for boring workouts when you can enjoy the best of both worlds? Unleash your inner fitness champion with the awesome combo of calisthenics and weightlifting - the ultimate recipe for a stronger, fitter, and more resilient version of yourself.

At the PV in Motion conference and exhibition in Switzerland in early March, Loic Tous, PV roof project leader at Belgium-based AGC Automotive Europe, presented the AGC panoramic vehicle-integrated photovoltaic (VIPV) sunroof for passenger vehicles, sedans, sport utility vehicles or minivans, with power outputs ranging from 170 W to 380 W, depending on the usable area for PV.

AGC offers a choice of high-efficiency cell designs with efficiency greater than 25%, according to Tous. The system can integrate either n-type monocrystalline silicon tunnel oxide passivated (TOPCon) or heterojunction (HJT) solar cells.

Another option is n-type back contact (xBC) solar cells. ""They offer a more premium all-black aesthetic look, and improved durability. Ultimately, the option recommended by AGC for a specific vehicle program depends on the car manufacturer's requirements in terms of costs, aesthetics, and durability,"" Tous told pv magazine.

The way the sunroof's energy is used within the vehicle is defined by AGC's customers. ""It depends on the electrical architecture chosen by the car manufacturer as there are different strategies to maximize the overall system efficiency. In general, the electricity generated by the sunroof during driving is used for self-consumption to power things like the heating-ventilation-air-conditioning, displays, and audio systems, while the electricity generated during parking is used to recharge either the high voltage or low voltage battery,"" explained Tous.

The VIPV unit features a glass-glass construction and it does not need a roller blind system, which saves up to 5 kg in weight and increases headroom by up to 30 mm. It can be directly mounted on vehicle assembly lines. The timing of mass production is not being disclosed due to customer confidentiality agreements, according to Tous.

Optional is a low-emissivity glass coating. ""It enables the VIPV version to have the same comfort level in summer and winter as AGC's thermal-comfort panoramic roof model without PV, a product that was integrated into a new passenger car launched in 2023,"" said Tous.

Commenting on sustainability practices, Tous said, ""To improve the carbon footprint of AGC panoramic solar roofs, we are minimizing the number of transport operations and sourcing all key materials, such as polysilicon, PV wafers and cells, interlayers, PV ribbons or wires, busbars and connectors, locally when possible. That's why AGC strongly supports the establishment of local supply chains for glass and PV components in all major markets: Europe, North America, and Asia.""

New Delhi [India], March 22: In the dynamic world of fitness, where new trends emerge almost as quickly as you can do a burpee, one approach is gaining traction for its transformative results: Hybrid Training. This cutting-edge fitness methodology seamlessly blends the best of two worlds - Calisthenics and Weightlifting. As we all work towards our goal of well-rounded, holistic fitness, this hybrid approach offers a unique and effective way to achieve strength, flexibility, and aesthetic goals. In this blog, we take a plunge into the different elements of Hybrid Training Techniques and explore how the combining calisthenics with weightlifting can help unlock a fitter, stronger, and more agile version of yourself.

Understanding Hybrid Training Techniques

Hybrid Training, in essence, is a holistic approach that combines different forms of exercise to create a comprehensive workout regimen. The fusion of Calisthenics and Weightlifting is a power-packed blend that focuses both bodyweight and resistance training. Calisthenics primarily involves using your body weight for resistance, while Weightlifting employs external loads to build strength. When these two come together, you can experience the benefits of functional movement, witness muscular development, and improve your overall fitness.

Calisthenics: The Foundation of Bodyweight Mastery

Calisthenics, rooted in ancient Greek training methods, relies on utilizing your own body weight to build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Calisthenics routines usually include bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats. These exercises along with working on multiple muscles, also improve coordination, balance, and your sense of equilibrium.

Fitness enthusiasts who embrace calisthenics often rave about the freedom it offers - no fancy gym equipment is required, making it an accessible choice for those who prefer outdoor workouts or have limited access to a gym. The best part about calisthenics is its adaptability; you can tailor the workouts to accommodate a range of fitness levels, making it suitable for beginners and seasoned athletes alike.

Weightlifting: Harnessing the Power of External Resistance

On the other end of the spectrum, Weightlifting involves the use of external resistance, typically in the form of barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells. This form of training is renowned for its ability to build raw strength and muscle mass. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously, fostering overall muscle development.

Weightlifting is often associated with the stereotypical image of a muscle-bound bodybuilder in a gym filled with clanging weights. However, the benefits outweigh this perception of aesthetics. Regular weightlifting enhances bone density, metabolism, and functional strength, making it an integral component of any well-rounded fitness routine.

The Synergy of Calisthenics and Weightlifting

However, this development was expected, as over time, and particularly from 2022 to 2023, the installed capacity of photovoltaic systems has increased significantly and continues to grow, without a corresponding increase in electricity consumption, mainly during spring and autumn.

This obliges the Transmission System Operator and the Distribution System Operator (DEDDIE Networks) to discard significant amounts of green production, as they are required to maintain energy produced by conventional units of DEDDIE in the transmission and distribution system at all times.

These conventional units, due to their stable and fully predictable production, ensure stability and security in the system, unlike electricity from renewable sources.

It is confirmed that the issuance of licenses by the competent authorities for an increasing number of photovoltaic systems, without simultaneous provision by the state and the private producers and electricity suppliers for the installation of storage systems, leads to stagnation in the penetration of RES in the energy mix, despite the increasing installation of photovoltaics.

It also leads to significant revenue losses from private sector investments in RES.

If these investments were combined with investments in storage, the losses would be significantly smaller for producers and suppliers.

On the other hand, the installation of storage systems, due to their high capital cost, is expected to lead to further increases in kilowatt-hour costs for consumers.

Although CERA (RAEK) has already issued licenses for standalone power storage systems up to 100 megawatts and other licenses for 90 megawatt hybrid storage systems that will support existing photovoltaic parks (to store energy currently being discarded), no investments have been made by private producers so far.

Most are waiting for the state subsidy scheme for batteries, through which an amount of 40 million euros is expected to be spent, secured by the EU Recovery Fund.

Information from Phileleftheros suggests that this scheme is quite likely to be announced in April.

It will take several months or even years for applications to be approved and licenses to be implemented, so the problem of discarding green energy due to low consumption during certain periods will continue and worsen.

The extension of the green energy cut problem causes issues in serving large commercial consumers contracted with entrepreneurs within the Transitional Electricity Market Regulation, as there is insufficient energy left to cover needs based on bilateral contracts.

The Transmission System Operator had forecasted for 2024, raising the percentage of energy produced from controlled photovoltaic systems (excluding household net metering) to be discarded throughout the year to 28%.

From the energy cut data within the first two months of 2024, it already seems that the cuts will be significantly higher this year compared to last year, without even having data for March and April, which are usually the months with the highest need for cuts.

For example, on 28/2/24, energy cuts from photovoltaics reached 63%, while on 27/2, cuts were 67% of total RES energy. On 25/2, it was 75%.

Most days in February had cuts at rates above or well above 25%, while only a few days had single-digit cut percentages.

Even worse are expected to be the cut measurements for March, which will be known in early April.

In December 2023, according to the data of the Transmission Operator, the installed capacity from photovoltaic systems was 638 megawatts, almost 200 megawatts more than what was installed in January 2023.",in-cyprus.philenews.com,news,in-cyprus.philenews.com,Chrysanthos Manoli,0.2313725490196079,448786470,1,https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/fotovoltaika-1.jpg,

Dear EarthTalk: I hear that there are thousands of damaged and spent wind turbine blades piling up in Texas. Is this waste an issue for the wind industry?

-- Bill Collins, Big Sandy, TX

In the West Texas town of Sweetwater, about 40 miles west of Abilene on Interstate 20, there is a field filled to the brim with unwanted wind turbine blades. The first of these blades were deposited in 2017 and over the years the blades have accumulated to cover over 30 acres of land. Each of the blades is between 100 and 400 feet in length and thousands cover the area. Residents of Sweetwater have protested the industrial landfill saying it is a hazard to residents. They worry about children playing in the garbage, swarms of mosquitoes breeding in the blades and rattlesnakes hiding in crannies of the unwanted blades.

Wind power has grown fast, making it the world's leading renewable energy option behind hydropower. The wind turbine blades are built to withstand the power of the elements for decades, but once they are decommissioned, they generally become waste. By 2050, turbine blades are expected to become nearly 43.4 million tons of trash. While about 90 percent of wind turbines themselves are recyclable, the blades are not. They are made by binding fiberglass together with epoxy resin, so they are difficult and expensive to break down. Because of this most blades end up incinerated or in landfills like that of Sweetwater.

Decommissioned blades are difficult and expensive to transport. Because of their size, they need to be cut up onsite before they can be moved. Most U.S. landfills don't have the space to take wind farm waste. Most of the time blades cannot be crushed either because most crushing equipment isn't big enough.

Some companies have been trying to find solutions to the growing issue of unused turbine blades. Vestas, one of the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturers, has supposedly found a groundbreaking new method to recycle turbine blades. In 2023, the Danish company announced that it had found a way to break the plastic in turbine blades down into virgin-grade materials. This solution would allow blades to be recycled to make new turbines instead of cluttering landfills. While it sounds promising, Vestas has so far divulged little information about how this would work.

Another possible solution would be to grind old blades up and use the material in other manufacturing industries. The drawback is that the blades are huge and difficult to crush, plus the material isn't really worth the hassle of crushing them. Veolia, a resource management company headquartered in France, shreds and blends blade materials to turn them into an ingredient for cement production. According to Veolia, using this technique reduces the pollution produced in cement manufacturing by 27 percent.

Implementing these types of solutions on a larger scale could help drastically reduce the amount of waste created by the wind industry. In the meantime, environmentalists are cheering on the wind industry to create new turbines that are easier to break down and reuse.

Furthermore, Darren Sammy has a contract with the West Indian Board, so he was not available. Former Australian cricketer Simon Katich also declined. Talks were held with Justin Langer but no positive response has been received so far.

Interestingly, the authorities do not want to appoint their former stars in top positions. Sources close to Azhar Mahmood who resides in England and Saqlain Mushtaq, confirmed that no contact has been made.

Moreover, Matthew Hayden, who was associated with the team in the past, has also been approached by the board. It has been reported that most coaches are not available due to commitments in the IPL.

When we implement systems it's vital to continually monitor and measure those systems for effectiveness and make appropriate changes if necessary.

With the previous principles in mind, let's look at a few examples of how we can improve our water situation. This is not a comprehensive list and if you want more information listen to our podcast here.

Water conservation is a simple and small, yet effective way to start a water strategy. If we are specifically conserving water that comes from our well we are likely doing three things: reducing pressure on the well, reducing pressure on our septic and potentially recharging ground water. Not bad! Here are a couple of suggestions to begin conserving water:

It boggles the mind why the use of graywater is not widespread in America. People tend to be apprehensive toward its use and governments impede the use of it under the catch-all, ""safety and security."" Used properly with some simple precautions this is a great resource.

Graywater systems range from the very simple to the highly complex. If you remember one of our principles is to start small and simple. A 5-gallon bucket under a sink is a great way to do that. Another example of a simple system is to have the graywater from a solar shower drain into a reed bed or a rain garden type planting. This can be used to irrigate ornamentals or even food producing plantings.

Catching rainwater is something that has been done for millennia. This is another method that just makes sense. A good rule of thumb to use is for every 1 inch of rain, 2,000 square feet of catchment will yield 1,250 gallons of water that can be used for irrigation, animals or even households.

You need to understand local law regarding rainwater catchment because, believe it or not, it is not legal everywhere and where it is legal there are usually at least some regulations governing the process. Again, start small and simple. A downspout into a rain barrel works great. Much more complex systems exist with underground cisterns that can be used in a pressurized system but let's not let ""the perfect be the enemy of the good.""

Rain gardens are excellent for dealing with excess runoff from a roof or dealing with a ""naturally"" wet area. In locations where rainwater catchment may be illegal this is a great solution to utilize the overflow and use it as a resource. The idea of a rain garden is to take up that excess moisture and to allow it to infiltrate the soil.

Think of it as a way to deal with stormwater. Creating rain gardens is rather easy. Areas of depression, whether natural or manmade can be created to gather the flow. Usually a downspout into a lower area will work very well. Plant native plants that can do well with lots of moisture. They should be able to handle wet feet at least some of the time.

If you really want to get technical you can split your rain garden up into zones: wet, moist and dry (relatively speaking) and then plant appropriately for those areas. However, if you stick with hardy ornamentals that can handle diverse conditions, including wet, then you should be just fine.

Ponds are very beneficial to the landscape. They are not really suitable for arid environments, but here in North Idaho, they work well. First, they are tremendously beautiful. Besides that very important benefit, they are useful for so much more. They provide water for irrigation, storage, animal watering and emergency water for the home. They provide a water source for wildlife of all kinds including amphibians and pollinators. The potential food sources in ponds are tremendous. The obvious one is fish and domestic waterfowl like ducks but also much more like watercress, cattail and duckweed.

Swales are water harvesting ditches on contour. They are masters at slowing, spreading and soaking water into the soil. They also happen to make excellent tree growing systems. Swales are a way to take water from valley or draw areas to ridge or finger areas. Essentially you are spreading water out to the areas where it is normally drier because rain tends to run off.

This blog post was but a sampling of how to implement a comprehensive water plan. If you take each major element of your property and assign a primary, secondary and tertiary water source it would be a great start. Not every element will likely have three different ways to source water but it's good to think through the situation in this manner.

I want to be clear. We don't normally break up each element of property and think about in a singular sense but in the case of water it sometimes helps. As permaculture design consultants we integrate all the elements of property to work together synergistically.

An investigation by journalist Ted Conover with Outside Magazine uncovered heartbreaking diary entries written by Talon Vance, 13, after he was whisked away to the Rocky Mountains wilderness by his mom Becky Vance, 42, and aunt Christine Vance, 41.

Talon weighed less than 40 pounds when their mummified remains were discovered, and their families said they had no survival skills or experience before Becky tried to 'escape society.'

As revealed this week by Outside Magazine, Talon's diary found next to his rotting remains detailed his mother's mystifying reliance on him to stay alive, despite him being homeschooled and only having rudimentary knowledge of how to tie a knot.

In the diary, he also wrote of his online friends begging him not to go off-grid, and suffering mental breakdowns because 'nothing feels the same anymore.'

Talon Vance, 13, wrote heartbreaking final diary entries where he was relied upon for survival in the wilderness and wrote of missing his friends

Talon froze to death in the Rocky Mountain wilderness when he was whisked away by his mom Becky, 42, and aunt Christine, 41 (pictured together)

He meticulously detailed his Roblox friends begging him not to go off-grid

Talon had previously spent most of his time with his father and half-siblings, until he was taken with his mother and aunt after Becky became convinced the pandemic was a sham.

An old acquaintance texted her months before she went off-grid, hoping to catch up. Her response led him to call the authorities when she fled to the wilderness.

After saying she wouldn't be available as she was soon leaving Colorado, Becky added: 'I know I probably sound like a 'conspiracy theorist,' but there are insane plots to take away our soul and humanity,

'If you've never heard about the Great Reset, WEF, 4th Industrial Revolution, then please look up Yuval Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, and their agenda.'

A final text to another friend read: 'They really want to merge man with machine, and I refuse to let them do that to me or my son... I don't know when all of this will happen, but I think it's important for people to get out while they still can.'

While still preparing for their getaway, Becky urged her son to learn wilderness skills, including knots and shelter building, which he would write about in his diary.

'Side note: I did the trucker's hitch first try!!' he wrote in one entry - shortly before he told his online friends on the game 'Roblox' that he was leaving.

He jotted down minute details of their interactions, including timestamps of messages, where his friends begged him: 'Please I will give anything for you to come back.'

'NOOO COME BACK,' read another entry.

Talan was relied upon for survival skills despite him being homeschooled and only having rudimentary knowledge of how to tie a knot

When they left in August 2022, Becky refused to share details of where they were going, and lied to some family members that they were going to West Virginia to be with her father.

During the trip, they stopped for food at the remote town of Gunnison for food. It was there that, as detailed in his diary, Talan wrote how he had a mental breakdown because 'nothing feels the same.'

'The Arby's we had was so tasty!' he wrote. Many of the diary entries appeared to be childish and innocent.

'I also had a mini breakdown at Arby's because nothing feels the same anymore [sad face]. During my breakdown, she took us to Safeway and let me pick out candy of my choice! I was so sad, that nothing really sounded appealing to me anymore.

'So I picked out chocolate for mommy mostly, and then Aunty suggested fruit snacks for me, so I just said 'OK.""

They eventually set up camp in the woods outside a campground at almost 10,000 feet in the mountains, in an area known for heavy snow.

Despite being offered an RV by a friend, Becky declined as she wanted to live truly off-grid - including without any electricity or heat generators.

It is unclear when exactly they died, and their mummified remains were found deep into the woods in July 2023 by a hiker. An autopsy ruled that they died of malnutrition and hypothermia.

Survival guides and empty food tins were scattered across their wooded campsite, according to the Gunnison County Coroner's office autopsies. No heaters were found in their tent which had been covered in snow during the winter.

Investigators were initially mystified by the discovery, not least because Talan's body was outside the tent where his mother and aunt were found.

They now believe, according to Conover, that the 13-year-old died first, and they moved him outside so they didn't have to sleep by his dead body.

Rebecca 'Becky' Vance, 42, her sister and her son were discovered in the Rocky Mountains where they had gone to live off-grid to 'escape society'

The 14-year-old (left) weighed just 40 pounds when he died alongside his mother Rebecca Vance (second from left) and aunt Christine Vance (right) Their stepsister Trevala Jara (second from right) said she begged them not to leave

In interviews with friends, family and investigators, Conover wrote for Outside Magazine that it took some time to truly realize how unprepared they were for the brutal conditions.

This included only packing an $80 Walmart tent, and only a fishing pole and seed packets for food.

They would make occasional trips into town, until their car was found abandoned in November 2023 and was towed by the US Forest Service, leaving them stranded.

Last summer, when they were found, Becky and Christine's stepsister Tevala Jara revealed that she begged them to change their mind.

'At first Christine didn't want to go, but she changed her mind. She felt like they had a better chance at living if she went with them,' Jara said. 'And she didn't want our sister and nephew to be alone.'

Jara, 39, added at the time that Talan was naive over the risks of his mother's beliefs.

'He was scared and excited at the same time,' she told the New York Post. 'He was only 13 when they left. He didn't know what living off the grid entails at all, but he wanted to be with his mom.'

Jara also remembered Beckly as a bit reserved, sharp as a whip, and someone who could read through a 1,000-page book in days. Vance's son was homeschooled and a math whiz, Jara said.

Christine Vance was more outgoing, charismatic and wasn't at first convinced on the idea to escape society, Jara said, 'but she just changed her mind because she didn't want our sister and nephew to be by themselves.'",expressdigest.com,news,expressdigest.com,,-0.2156862745098039,448783387,1,,eng-9419059

The current-generation Lexus RX was first unveiled in 2022, and arrived locally in early 2023. The large five-seat SUV is currently offered locally with a range of petrol and hybrid powertrains.

A plug-in hybrid RX 450h+ is currently offered in other markets, including the USA. It's powered a 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with two electric motors and an 18.1kWh lithium-ion battery pack.

The same powertrain features in the smaller NX 450h+ plug-in hybrid.

Total system output for the US-specification RX 450h+ is 205kW of power.

Lexus claims the US-specification RX 450h+ has an electric-only range of 59km according to EPA testing.

When the Lexus RX 450h+ goes on sale locally it will go up against the likes of the Audi Q8 60 TFSI e, BMW X5 xDrive50e, Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve 4xe, Range Rover Sport P460e, and Volkswagen Touareg R, among others.

British housebuilder Pye Homes, which builds homes across Oxfordshire, has been installing low carbon air source heat pumps (ASHPs) in its buildings three years early.

According to official sources, the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) published a policy guideline titled: ""Grid Integration Guideline for Solar Irrigation Pump"" in July 2020.

The main purpose of the guideline was to facilitate solar pump operators to sell their idle electricity to distribution entities and also the distribution entities' purchase of electricity from pump operators under a specific policy.

The idea of purchasing electricity from solar-run irrigation pumps came from the government's success in purchasing power from rooftop solar plants installed in office and industrial buildings, SREDA officials said.

During the off-season, the government will buy electricity from the solar irrigation plant operators. Under the plan, pump operators will be able to sell their idle electricity to the national grid using local distribution grid lines.

But ""Grid Integration Guideline for Solar Irrigation Pump"" failed to make any significant breakthrough in setting up solar irrigation pumps to replace the diesel-fired pumps.

So far, about 6000 pumps, out of 1.34 million diesel fired pumps, were converted to solar-run pumps, said a SREDA official.

But the stakeholders do not agree with such figures. Dipal C Barua, who is deeply involved in solar irrigation and has been implementing a number of projects in Kustia and Dinajpur districts, said so far about 3000 irrigation pumps were set up across the country.

He, also former president of Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA) said that replacing the diesel-fired pumps with solar-pumps reduced the cost of irrigation by 40-50 percent.

""For a crop season, farmers now spend Tk 2000 for a land while they had to pay Tk 4000 for irrigation by diesel-fired pumps,"" he told UNB.

But such a project is individually not attractive for a single farmer and also for distribution companies to buy idle power, he observed with his experience of installing about 30 irrigation pumps in Pabna.

There must be a unique business model to make the solar irrigation initiative where it will be lucrative for both pump operators, formers and utilities, he said.

Expressing a similar opinion, a senior SREDA official said the Power Division is now thinking of forming an inter-ministerial committee to evolve a business model to make the solar irrigation project successful.

Recently, the SREDA organized a meeting to discuss the overall situation of the solar irrigation pumps.

In the meeting Prime Minister's Energy Advisor Dr Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury directed the officials in the power sector to set a target under a specific plan to convert the country's diesel-fired irrigation pumps into solar-run ones.

""You have to set a goal under a plan to increase the number of solar-run pumps in irrigation,"" he told SREDA officials.

He also advised the farmers not to use excessive water than required for the irrigation.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid also addressed the event at the SREDA office.

The energy advisor said that a committee will be formed after Eid from the Prime Minister's office so that an effective role can be played in reaching the desired goal in the renewable energy sector.

Emphasizing the mobilization of the climate fund, he said there should be an initiative to collect promised amounts of money from the Loss & Damage Fund announced in Cop-28.

Nasrul Hamid said there should be united efforts for promotion of solar irrigation pumps. Reducing the use of diesel pumps will also reduce carbon emissions.

An investigation by journalist Ted Conover with Outside Magazine uncovered heartbreaking diary entries written by Talon Vance, 13, after he was whisked away to the Rocky Mountains wilderness by his mom Becky Vance, 42, and aunt Christine Vance, 41.

Talon weighed less than 40 pounds when their mummified remains were discovered, and their families said they had no survival skills or experience before Becky tried to 'escape society.'

As revealed this week by Outside Magazine, Talon's diary found next to his rotting remains detailed his mother's mystifying reliance on him to stay alive, despite him being homeschooled and only having rudimentary knowledge of how to tie a knot.

In the diary, he also wrote of his online friends begging him not to go off-grid, and suffering mental breakdowns because 'nothing feels the same anymore.'

He meticulously detailed his Roblox friends begging him not to go off-grid

Talon had previously spent most of his time with his father and half-siblings, until he was taken with his mother and aunt after Becky became convinced the pandemic was a sham.

An old acquaintance texted her months before she went off-grid, hoping to catch up. Her response led him to call the authorities when she fled to the wilderness.

After saying she wouldn't be available as she was soon leaving Colorado, Becky added: 'I know I probably sound like a 'conspiracy theorist,' but there are insane plots to take away our soul and humanity,

'If you've never heard about the Great Reset, WEF, 4th Industrial Revolution, then please look up Yuval Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, and their agenda.'

A final text to another friend read: 'They really want to merge man with machine, and I refuse to let them do that to me or my son... I don't know when all of this will happen, but I think it's important for people to get out while they still can.'

While still preparing for their getaway, Becky urged her son to learn wilderness skills, including knots and shelter building, which he would write about in his diary.

'Side note: I did the trucker's hitch first try!!' he wrote in one entry - shortly before he told his online friends on the game 'Roblox' that he was leaving.

He jotted down minute details of their interactions, including timestamps of messages, where his friends begged him: 'Please I will give anything for you to come back.'

'NOOO COME BACK,' read another entry.

Talan was relied upon for survival skills despite him being homeschooled and only having rudimentary knowledge of how to tie a knot

When they left in August 2022, Becky refused to share details of where they were going, and lied to some family members that they were going to West Virginia to be with her father.

They eventually set up camp in the woods outside a campground at almost 10,000 feet in the mountains, in an area known for heavy snow.

Despite being offered an RV by a friend, Becky declined as she wanted to live truly off-grid - including without any electricity or heat generators.

It is unclear when exactly they died, and their mummified remains were found deep into the woods in July 2023 by a hiker. An autopsy ruled that they died of malnutrition and hypothermia.

In interviews with friends, family and investigators, Conover wrote for Outside Magazine that it took some time to truly realize how unprepared they were for the brutal conditions.

This included only packing an $80 Walmart tent, and only a fishing pole and seed packets for food.

They would make occasional trips into town, until their car was found abandoned in November 2023 and was towed by the US Forest Service, leaving them stranded.",dailymail.co.uk,news,Daily Mail Online,,-0.2470588235294118,448781825,1,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/03/22/05/82764175-0-image-a-76_1711085503902.jpg,eng-9419059

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has passed a decision allowing distributed renewable energy resources like residential solar and battery energy storage to interconnect to the grid without triggering grid impacts that require costly infrastructure upgrades.

Under the rulemaking decision, distributed resources can interconnect as a Limited Generation Profile (LGP). This will enable the resources to join the grid without paying grid upgrade fees and delays related to upgrade work. California is the first state to enact such a resolution for distributed energy.

""Limited Generation Profiles specify the maximum amount of electric generation a DER [distributed energy resource] system will export to the grid at different times throughout the year, ensuring that the project is responsive to fluctuating grid constraints at different times,"" said the order.

The grid has physical limits on how much electricity it can accept from energy generation sources. Known as hosting capacity, this limit varies widely hour-by-hour, day-to-day and seasonally based on intermittent generation and consumption levels. In the case of solar, California afternoons and sunnier times of the year lead to peak generation levels that may exceed grid limits in some locations.

California utilities are required by law to provide an hourly model of the hosting capacity available on the local distribution grid at local node or substation. This hourly report is called an ""Integration Capacity Analysis.""

Under the new CPUC ruling, renewable energy developers can now use the Integration Capacity Analysis to ensure a project stays within hosting capacity limits, thereby becoming eligible for interconnection without triggering grid upgrade fees.

The ruling created guidelines for how an LGP is classified and controlled and sets a fixed schedule for export limits that can be adjusted 24 times per year. The LGP structuring was developed with input from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). It defines the types of power control systems eligible for LGP curtailment, the allowable format of LGP scheduling and how many times per year a project can change output levels, and instances when a utility may curtail power generation.

IREC assisted CPUC in developing the configuration for curtailment and export schedules for LGP. It said the format ""will allow projects to design configurations that take advantage of the specific daily and seasonal peak periods that arise at the project's proposed location on the grid.""

IREC said the LGP resolution ""is a satisfactory resolution that mitigates risk for project developers, while providing reasonable assurances for utilities.""

Gwen Brown, vice president of communications at IREC called the ruling ""a momentous first for the nation."" However, Brown noted that there is still room for distributed energy resource (DER) operation to evolve beyond the look-ahead fixed-schedule format created by the LGP.

""Under flexible interconnection paradigms, rather than implementing a fixed schedule, DERs would be dynamically controlled to respond to real-time conditions on the grid,"" said Brown. ""This approach offers some advantages for the grid operator as grid conditions change and needs evolve. However, the costs of deploying the sophisticated communication systems necessary for this approach are considerable and it may take many years before they are widely deployed.""

Brown said both the fixed schedule offered by LGP and more flexible approaches to distributed energy management systems (DERMS) will likely play a role in the integration of resources like rooftop solar and energy storage in the coming years.",pv-magazine.com,news,pv magazine International,Ryan Kennedy,0.3333333333333333,448780957,51,https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IREC.image_.3-1536x1136-1-280x280.png,

The Daily Tribune - www.newsofbahrain.com

Bank ABC Egypt announced the successful completion of its merger with BLOM Bank Egypt, marking the beginning of a new era of growth for the Bank.

This historic merger for Bank ABC triples it market share in Egypt and combines the strengths of the two leading financial institutions; creating a new entity that is ready to deliver a new kind of banking to its customers.

Bank ABC Group Chairman, Saddek Omar El Kaber, said, ""I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all those who played a vital role in making this merger a reality. I would especially like to thank the Central Bank of Egypt, for their guidance, approval and support throughout this process.""

Bank ABC Group CEO, Sael Al Waary, said, ""The combined Bank is poised for growth, innovation and to introduce a new kind of banking. With our combined expertise and vision for the future, we are equipped to better serve our clients.""

Since the legal merger in January 2023, a detailed integration program has examined every aspect of the Bank's business and operational infrastructure, seeking to preserve the best of both banks, to create a stronger competitive and overall customer value proposition.

The merger has doubled Bank ABC's network of branches and ATMs, with the best of both banks now integrated into a more competitive proposition. Bank ABC Egypt MD and CEO, Amr Tharwat, said, ""Now our integration is complete, we're determined to deliver on our promise of creating the best banking experience possible for our customers.

This expansion has been made possible through the implementation of data and model parallelism techniques, as well as pipelining methods, which distribute computational tasks across multiple devices simultaneously. These advancements allow for the concurrent utilization of many computing devices.

Though modifications to model architectures and optimization techniques have made computing parallelism possible, the core training paradigm has not significantly altered. Cutting-edge models continue to work together as cohesive units, and optimization procedures require parameter, gradient, and activation swapping throughout training. There are a number of issues with this traditional method.

Provisioning and managing the networked devices necessary for extensive training involves a significant amount of engineering and infrastructure. Every time a new model release is released, the training process frequently needs to be restarted, which means that a substantial amount of computational resources used to train the previous model are wasted. Training monolithic models also present organizational issues because it is hard to determine the impact of changes made during the training process other than just preparing the data.

To overcome these issues, a team of researchers from Google DeepMind has proposed a modular machine learning ML framework. The DIstributed PAths COmposition (DiPaCo) architecture and training algorithm have been presented in an attempt to achieve this scalable modular Machine Learning paradigm. DiPaCo's optimization and architecture are specially made to reduce communication overhead and improve scalability.

The distribution of computing by paths, where a path is a series of modules forming an input-output function, is the fundamental idea underlying DiPaCo. In comparison to the overall model, paths are relatively small, requiring only a few securely connected devices for testing or training. A sparsely active DiPaCo architecture results from queries being directed to replicas of particular paths rather than replicas of the complete model during both training and deployment.

An optimization method called DiLoCo has been used, which is inspired by Local-SGD and minimizes communication costs by maintaining module synchronization with less communication. This optimization strategy improves training robustness by mitigating worker failures and preemptions.

The effectiveness of DiPaCo has been demonstrated by the tests on the popular C4 benchmark dataset. DiPaCo achieved better performance than a dense transformer language model with one billion parameters, even with the same amount of training steps. With only 256 pathways to choose from, each with 150 million parameters, DiPaCo can accomplish higher performance in a shorter amount of wall clock time. This illustrates how DiPaCo can handle complex training jobs efficiently and scalably.

In conclusion, DiPaCo eliminates the requirement for model compression approaches at inference time by reducing the number of paths that must be completed for each input to just one. This simplified inference procedure lowers computing costs and increases efficiency. DiPaCo is a prototype for a new, less synchronous, more modular paradigm of large-scale learning. It shows how to obtain better performance with less training time by utilizing modular designs and effective communication tactics.",marktechpost.com,news,MarkTechPost,Tanya Malhotra,0.223529411764706,448780336,1,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-8.16.54-PM.png,

Because of the uncertainties regarding the global economy and ever rising Indian stock market, advisors have been advising investors to move cautiously. In such a scenario they believe that investing in hybrid mutual funds - schemes that invest in equity and debt - may serve investors, especially new and inexperienced investors, better.

Conservative hybrid funds are the entry to the world of hybrid funds. These schemes invest mostly in debt and a small percent in equity. As per the Sebi mandate, conservative hybrid schemes must invest 75-90% in debt instruments and 10-25% in stocks. These schemes are ideal for investors looking to invest a small part of their corpus in equity to earn some extra returns.

Conservative hybrid schemes, as the name suggests, are meant for investors with a conservative risk profile.

These schemes are similar to erstwhile monthly income plans or MIPs. MIPs were extremely popular at one point. They used to invest a small part of their portfolio in stocks. But their USP, as the name suggests, was regular income in the form of dividends. However, regular dividends stopped when the market got into a bad phase. That was the end of MIPs. The lesson: do not bank on hybrid funds to secure a regular income.

If you are looking for regular income, it is always better to opt for a systematic withdrawal plan or SWP. However, be careful about how much you withdraw if you don't want to touch your capital. Always withdraw less than what you make if you want to preserve your capital.

If you want a ready-made scheme that would help you to take a small exposure to equity, here are our recommended conservative hybrid schemes. However, you should always remember, especially if you are investing in stocks for the first time, that stocks are risky. Stocks do not offer predictable or assured returns year after year. They can also lose money during a downturn. In short, it is the risk you are taking when you are investing in stocks, even if it is a maximum 25% of your investment.

Canara Robeco Conservative Hybrid Fund, one of our recommended schemes, has been in the third quartile for the last four months. Note, the scheme has been part of our recommended funds in the last year, too. You don't have to worry about short-term underperformance. We closely watch the performance of these schemes and update you about it every month. Please follow monthly updates if you are investing in these schemes.

Here's our methodology:

ETMutualFunds has employed the following parameters for shortlisting the Hybrid mutual fund schemes.

1. Mean rolling returns: Rolled daily for the last three years.

2. Consistency in the last three years: Hurst Exponent, H is used for computing the consistency of a fund. The H exponent is a measure of randomness of NAV series of a fund. Funds with high H tend to exhibit low volatility compared to funds with low H.

i) When H = 0.5, the series of returns is said to be a geometric Brownian time series. These types of time series are difficult to forecast.

ii) When H <0.5, the series is said to mean reverting.

iii) When H>0.5, the series is said to be persistent. The larger the value of H, the stronger is the trend of the series

3. Downside risk: We have considered only the negative returns given by the mutual fund scheme for this measure.

X = Returns below zero

Y = Sum of all squares of X

Z = Y/number of days taken for computing the ratio

Downside risk = Square root of Z

4. Outperformance

i) Equity portion: It is measured by Jensen's Alpha for the last three years. Jensen's Alpha shows the risk-adjusted return generated by a mutual fund scheme relative to the expected market return predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Higher Alpha indicates that the portfolio performance has outstripped the returns predicted by the market.

Average returns generated by the MF Scheme =

[Risk Free Rate + Beta of the MF Scheme * {(Average return of the index - Risk Free Rate}

ii) Debt portion: Fund Return - Benchmark return. Rolling returns rolled daily is used for computing the return of the fund and the benchmark and subsequently the Active return of the fund.

5. Asset size: For Hybrid funds, the threshold asset size is Rs 50 crore.

The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal require most of their staff to come into the office three days a week, while the other companies allow teams to determine their own in-person work requirements.

Why haven't digital publishers gone back to working fully in person? The answer seems to be that employees are happy with the flexibility they've been given with hybrid work, and employers are willing to continue to offer that to them.

""Forbes continues to offer employees flexibility on work location where it meets the needs of our roles and the business. This model has been working for Forbes for several years now, and we've received positive feedback from our employees,"" said a Forbes spokesperson.

A ""vast majority"" of The New York Times' workforce is also hybrid, according to a company spokesperson. They did not specify if certain roles were required to come in full-time. ""We believe that allowing people the flexibility to work together in the office at times and remotely at other times benefits everyone by ensuring that we maintain the strong, collaborative environment that has come to define our culture and drive our success,"" they said.

The Wall Street Journal's reporters are required to work either in their office or in the field three days per week, a system that's been in place since November 2022, said Tim Martell, executive director of Dow Jones' union IAPE. Senior editors and managers, however, have been encouraged to work in-office on a full-time basis, he added.

""We are still negotiating a contract with Dow Jones and our current proposal regarding in-office work would cap mandatory office days at three per week. Until recently, management had been proposing an end to days-per-week limits effective March 31. The company withdrew that proposal last month,"" said Martell. The Wall Street Journal declined to comment.

Union pushback to return to office mandates also have contributed to continued hybrid working models. Newsroom unions argue that return to office arrangements are mandatory subjects of bargaining, or topics that must be negotiated between unions and management as a legal requirement, and have pushed employers to walk back mandated returns to in-office work.

A Reuters Institute report released in December found that about two-thirds (65%) of senior newsroom leaders surveyed said their employers had implemented flexible and hybrid working models - up slightly from 61% in the same ""Changing Newsrooms"" report conducted in 2022. Only 16% had returned to the pre-pandemic model, which is defined as the majority of employees' time being spent in-person in the office, down from 20% in 2022.

Thirty-percent of respondents said staff are required to be in the office some number of fixed days per week and their company is enforcing the rule (down from 49% in 2022). But 22% said that no one is checking if they really are going into the office as often as they are required to. (The report surveyed 135 senior industry leaders from 40 countries.)

Hybrid work has ""been a dramatic improvement"" to work-life balance for Hearst Union members, said Zach Lennon-Simon, senior video editor at Delish and Hearst Union member. He added that, despite the fact that employees are encouraged to come into the office a few days a week, he had not heard of any members getting penalized for not doing so.

One common issue with hybrid working models is that employees come into the office when they want - and find that no one else from their team is there, so they end up participating in virtual meetings anyway.

BDG is testing a different approach this year to mitigate that problem. The company has adopted a ""core week model,"" where the company has identified about 25 weeks of the year (around key events or busy coverage periods) that employees are encouraged to come into the New York office from Tuesday through Thursday, according to a spokesperson.

""Giving employees flexibility is what [they're] looking for,"" said Paul Wolfe, a former HR exec and author of ""Human Beings First."" ""It's also something free that a company can give to their employees, that doesn't really cost them anything if they do it in the right way [that can] keep them happy and engaged when they're given a choice about how and when they do their work.""",digiday.com,news,Digiday,Sara Guaglione,0.223529411764706,448776220,1,https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/hybrid-work-single-01.jpg,

Instagram reels. The endearing videos of Jasmeen showcasing her latest sarees and suits to potential clients even caught the attention of Bollywood stars and their hundreds of millions of followers. As a woman entrepreneur in India, Jasmeen was riding the wave of India's economic growth and using the tools at her disposal to beat the competition. Yet, for women like her, it is not just the power of digital marketing that is reshaping their business potential, but India's revolutionary approach to Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) known as the 'India Stack'.

The India Stack is a set of digital public infrastructure components that comprise three pillars: digital identification; payments; and data management. India's approach to digitalisation has fundamentally changed lives, giving biometric identification to those previously not identifiable, banking the unbanked, and giving people control and privacy in managing their own data. For women like Jasmeen, the ubiquity of the Stack means she can receive payments from consumers, share legal documents with her bank or lawyer, pay her suppliers, receive loans or investments, and coordinate delivery payments through the fast, easy, and cheap technology.

Given how Indian society and economy is now structured around DPI, and with its enormous diaspora across the globe, there is significant opportunity to unlock the country's economic potential to international markets. This article argues that as countries pursue economic diversification and grapple with the digitisation of the global economy, they should look to the India Stack for learnings in how to effectively unlock economic potential in their bilateral relationships and for their own digital public infrastructure. As developed countries seek to reform legacy financial systems or developing countries build new ones, India has a world-leading solution that can revolutionise how global economies engage with India and with each other. Integrating India's DPI means international markets can go from ""just looking"" at the India opportunity, to building deep integration with its economic system.

The first section describes India's approach to DPI and its key components, with a focus on its digital identification and payments systems. The article then outlines the international opportunity as exemplified by the case of Singapore and India's DPI cooperation. The third section includes key lessons that other countries and markets can learn from India's DPI experience. The essay concludes by offering a key takeaway: that India has revolutionised DPI with the India Stack, and global economies can benefit from integration.

India's Approach to Digital Public Infrastructure

Digital Public Infrastructures are the railways of digital technology. For India, its approach to DPI is based on the foundation of open-source, interoperable, and scalable technology along with transparent, accountable, and participatory governance frameworks. A layered 'stack' of open-source Applications Programming Interfaces (APIs) are owned and maintained by different government agencies, and developers can build software using these DPIs to deliver cheap products to the market. This technology has laid the foundation for a robust digital services infrastructure, and it fosters innovation and entrepreneurship leading to the development of a wide range of applications and services across sectors, including finance, healthcare, and education, contributing to economic growth and technological advancement.

By design, India's DPI was built to be universally accessible for adoption, reuse, and replication by countries worldwide. India's example demonstrates that collaborative digital solutions are a way to deliver vital services to the population in a way that is scalable. This type of DPI not only propels innovation, competition, and inclusivity but is also underpinned by regulatory frameworks that facilitate its operation. It is further supported by a robust technological layer, a well-defined governance framework, and a diverse multistakeholder ecosystem.

As the foundational layer to the India Stack, the Aadhaar programme is a biometrically secured digital system that has since brought over 1.3 billion people online. Aadhaar has enabled electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) with simultaneous identification, which means that citizens can open bank accounts in minutes instead of the two to four weeks it would take previously. This is coupled with the Indian government's financial inclusion programme, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (Jan Dhan), which has brought over 500 million people -- the majority of whom are women -- into the banking system. In the 10 years between 2011 and 2021, India's bank account ownership doubled to 71 percent of the population, with a gender gap of effectively zero.

The sheer scale of Aadhaar meant it became the base layer that enabled the integration of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) -- a real-time payments system that enables users to link multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application. Today, over 68 percent of transactions in India are conducted using UPI, with 10.6 billion transactions taking place in August 2023 alone. UPI is facilitated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). That UPI is built upon the Aadhaar and other layers of the open-source Stack, overall transaction costs in the economy are significantly reduced. This not only benefits businesses by making transactions more cost-effective for consumers, but also encourages the shift from cash-based transactions, leading to greater transparency and accountability in the financial ecosystem.

In addition to the Aadhaar and UPI, a third layer to the India Stack is the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) -- a regulated framework introduced by the RBI and the NPCI that empowers users to share their data through a Consent Manager. DEPA accords individuals control over their personal data and facilitates the seamless and secure sharing of this data with third-party service providers. DEPA is designed to enable the portability of user data between different service providers while ensuring privacy and security as data cannot be stored, and is instead transferred by 'go-betweens' or 'fiduciaries'. The architecture involves the creation of consent-based data-sharing mechanisms, allowing individuals to selectively share their data with authorised entities. This is a very different model to data governance seen in other countries, where data aggregators tend to offer services in exchange for data which is then sold.

These key layers of the India Stack have brought economic and social impact at an unmatched scale anywhere else in the world. The India Stack has contributed to financial inclusion by providing a secure and accessible platform for digital transactions. This has enabled millions of Indians, including those in rural areas who make up 64 percent of the population, to participate in the formal economy.

Prior to the India Stack and DPI, there was no central digital identification system in the country. The fragmented, paper-based identification systems that did exist have been described as ""systematically tainted"" and excluded the most vulnerable who could not afford to pay bribes, among other fraudulent activities. Alongside the lack of digital ID, in 2016 Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, taking more than 86 percent of cash out of circulation. At the time, the prime minister was heavily criticised for demonetising an economy where 90 percent of the population, especially women and the poor, relied on cash payments. In an article for the Harvard Business Review, Bhaskar Chakravorti described it as ""Modi's war on cash"" and asked whether the forced digitisation of India would work; fast forward to 2024 and the answer is yes, it did.

The Global Opportunity for the India Stack

The India Stack, and particularly the UPI, have not only transformed India's financial system but also hold immense potential for influencing the global economy. As the landscape of global finance is undergoing a paradigm shift, with technological innovations reshaping traditional systems, the India Stack has enabled the country to leapfrog legacy financial and payments systems of developed countries. Furthermore, the Indian diaspora is the world's largest, and is therefore driving demand for international access to UPI for easier trade, tourism, international entrepreneurship, and cross-border remittances. International markets including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and France have all either adopted or are looking to adopt UPI technology.

Indeed, the economic and strategic case for greater integration with India makes sense. India is the world's fifth largest economy, with a nominal GDP of US$3.3 trillion. The population of 1.4 billion, which is the largest of any country, are young and have considerable potential. The economy is also growing at a very fast rate of around 6-8 percent annually and will soon be the world's fastest growing large economy. The consumer and aspirational classes are also growing, and they have increased demands for goods, services and education. The macroeconomic story of India is remarkable, and the result of smart policy decisions from economic liberalisation starting in the 1980s. This has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty, and infant mortality and life expectancy have improved. India's diaspora is spread across the world with significant populations in West Asia, Southeast Asia, North America, Africa, and Australia. They make an enormous contribution to the global economy, whether they are sending home remittances from the Gulf or running multinational companies in the United States.

This is all against a backdrop of increasing global strategic competition and a push for greater economic diversification and reduced trade reliance on China. It is no wonder, then, that countries around the world are starting to look to greater integration with the India Stack.

The Singapore example is one that developed countries can consider for experience in bringing the UPI into global markets. Singapore is a developed and advanced economy with a large Indian migrant population and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). Both countries were seeking ways to build digital infrastructure that could deliver faster, cheaper, cross-border payments that could accommodate future volumes of remittance traffic. Doing this required an extensive partnership between the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the RBI, and both countries' payment system operators, payment scheme owners, and participating banks and non-bank financial institutions.

In February 2023 the MAS and RBI signed a Memorandum of Understanding where, unlike at similar such events typically characterised by political formalities, the prime ministers of the two countries transferred money to each other in real-time from their respective locations. This could be achieved through bilateral cooperation between both private sector and government actors and demonstrates how developed countries can integrate their payment systems with the India Stack. As UPI integration scales in Singapore, there remains enormous potential for non-Indian diaspora to access the Indian financial system through the UPI where there is both political will and innovation.

Recommendations for International Adoption of the India Stack

To unlock the potential of economic integration and trade with India, international markets need to make structural changes in how they approach international payments with the country. International transfers to India, as with other countries, can be slow and bureaucratic; in contrast, domestic payments in India are fast, efficient, and low-cost. The India Stack and UPI has accelerated India's economy and has opened the banking system for over a billion people -- it is this scale that can benefit both developed and developing countries the world over. There are a number of lessons that global markets and governments can learn from India's DPI experience:

Conclusion

The India Stack may seem like an overnight success story yet was one that took ten years to build. Any observer of or participant in India's economy over the last decade would have witnessed a transformation not seen anywhere else globally. Today, the world's largest country by population is structured around the India Stack, and particularly its UPI. This has led to widespread financial inclusion across the country, which is an essential element of the India growth story.

While countries look to India for economic diversification and with the huge Indian diaspora across the globe, there is both a demand and a need for integration into the Indian economic payments systems. This is significant, because there is no other similar comprehensive structural transformation in a developing country that developed countries are looking to adopt. India has jumped ahead of traditional payments models in advanced economies through its bottom-up approach to digital public infrastructure. To respond to this transformation, other countries and markets will need to adapt to India -- and not the other way around -- if they truly want to move beyond ""just looking like a wow"", when looking at the India economic opportunity.

""We're not sure that the diesel, if it were available to us, would offer more in terms of drivability and capability for consumers - so at the moment, it's not something we're considering.""

As for the plug-in hybrid powertrain offered overseas, it's on GWM Australia's radar.

""It's something that we can look at. [Tank 500 PHEV] is not necessarily available for us to take right here today if we want, but it is under consideration longer-term,"" said Mr Maciver.

The company already offers regular hybrid versions of its Haval Jolion, Haval H6 and Tank 300 SUVs, with the larger Tank 500 coming here exclusively - at least at first - with hybrid power.

GWM is also expected to bring the Cannon Alpha ute here with hybrid power, while it already has one electric vehicle (EV) in the small Ora hatchback with another EV expected to follow.

But while the company offers plug-in hybrids in markets like China and Thailand, none have arrived here yet.

The Tank 500 PHEV has a 37.1kWh lithium-ion battery pack, an front-mounted electric motor, a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine, and a four-wheel drive system.

Claimed combined outputs are 300kW of power and 750Nm of torque.

A plug-in hybrid Tank 500 was recently snapped at GWM Australia headquarters in Melbourne, and GWM Australia this week confirmed it's looking at slotting in plug-in hybrid models to meet looming emissions standards Down Under.

""The devil, of course, is in the details. We don't know exactly what the final judgment of the announcement is going to be, but we do believe that GWM is well-placed with the range of vehicles that we've got today,"" Mr Maciver told media.

""Obviously, when we understand final outcome of the legislation, we will study that more closely, and if that means we have to look at other alternatives and other technologies such as plug-in hybrid, that's something we can look at.

""But I can confidently say... the level of investment into powertrain technology is impressive, and that gives us the confidence to stand here today and say we're going to be relatively well-equipped to offer the right powertrain choices once we understand exactly what the new vehicle emissions standards look like.""

Depending on which option the Australian Government pursues for its New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES), the Tank 500's turbo-petrol 3.0-litre V6 could be offered here.

Offered in China, the V6 pumps out 265kW and 500Nm.

""It's a powertrain that we could have available potentially, but for [emissions regulations] reasons we're going to have to consider very carefully what that means from an emissions perspective,"" said Mr Maciver.

""V6, probably, we think is not the right choice for us at this stage - but we'll watch carefully, if we can make it work, it's a consideration, but at this stage it's not available.""

Numerous nanophotonic and metamaterials capable of radiative sky cooling have been reported over the past decade. However, the cooling power density of such materials is approximately one magnitude lower (100 W m▫$^{-2}$▫) compared to terrestrial solar irradiation. Furthermore, improved optical characteristics could yield a modest increase in cooling power density due to the blackbody radiation limit. We report a rationally designed AsymSkyCool method (Asymmetrically sized heat-source-on-radiative-Sky-Cooling-coated-substrate) for radiative sky cooling thermal concentration (tcRC). The tcRC concept yields over 2000 W m▫$^{-2}$▫ at night and close to 1000 W m▫$^{-2}$▫ at 493 W m▫$^{-2}$▫ solar irradiation. The nearly tenfold improvement over the state-of-the-art sky cooling-based concentrators is enabled by advanced thermal management utilizing radiative energy concentration and localization. As climate plays a crucial role in the radiative sky cooling material performance, the concept has been experimentally verified in three geolocations, including Ljubljana, Slovenia (46.04°N), Shanghai, China (31.02°N), and Kunming, China (24.86°N).

Shore connection enables the diverse fleet of dredgers, offshore construction and support vessels to avoid carbon emissions by shutting off their engines and drawing on shore power while at berth. Headquartered in Belgium, DEME is a leading contractor in the fields of offshore energy, environmental remediation, dredging and marine infrastructure.

DEME has set itself a goal of cutting 40 percent from the greenhouse gases generated by its fleet by 2030 compared to 2008, moving significantly ahead of the revised emissions reduction target set by the International Maritime Organization in 2023. ABB will install shore power to connect to suitably equipped vessels calling at Vlissingen's DEME base by the end of 2024, as part of the ""Temporary Shore Power Grant Scheme for Marine Vessels 2022 - 2023"", a government-supported initiative that stimulates the construction and use of shore power facilities in Dutch seaports.

Offering a key route for ship owners to make measurable progress towards decarbonization, connecting to shore power for energy needs while at berth is expected to become mandatory at main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network from 2030, under FuelEU Maritime regulations.

""This project is part of DEME's wider strategy to integrate its sustainable business goals with daily operations,"" Marc De Boom, Department Manager, DEME Base Vlissingen. ""DEME has high ambitions regarding CO? reductions, and we are proud to be the first Belgian marine contractor who achieved the highest level of the CO? performance ladder, which is widely used in the Netherlands and Belgium. We are happy to collaborate with ABB, an experienced and reliable technology leader with a solid track record in shore connection installations.""

Awarded after a private tender process, the DEME contract provides a strong example of the way ABB aligns with local interests to ensure that its solutions are flexible in helping meet decarbonization milestones. Ultimately planned as a 2MvA converter, ABB's shoreside shore connection will run at a lower 1.75MvA until the local grid can deliver sufficient capacity between the substation and the power outlet at the dock. In a straightforward installation, the entire solution will be housed in two ISO containers - one 40-ft unit and one 20-ft unit.

""We are delighted to have secured this significant shore connection contract and look forward to working with DEME to support its ambitious commitments for maritime decarbonization,"" said Frank van Delden, Account Manager, ABB Marine & Ports. ""Given the diversity of the DEME fleet, this is a key reference for our shore power technology, showing that almost any type of vessel can avoid emissions by connecting to shore power at the quay.""

Established as the market leading supplier of shipside shore connection solutions, ABB delivered the world's first shore power supply system to the Swedish port of Gothenburg in 2000 and the first shipside installation in 2001. Today, ABB shore connections can be installed on a standardized, pre-assembled basis for integration with all shipboard electricity consumers.",maritime-executive.com,news,Maritime Executive,,0.2862745098039217,448768262,1,https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Ports/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-9.23.26-PM.2d3127.png,

Quesnel's city council voted unanimously to denounce a book the Lhtako Dene Nation says downplays the harms of residential schools, after the First Nation and councillors raised concerns the mayor's wife was distributing it to residents in the city about 630 kilometres north of Vancouver.

Several copies of Grave Error: How the Media Misled Us (and the Truth about Residential Schools) by C.P. Champion and Tom Flanagan have been circulated by Pat Morton, Mayor Ron Paull's wife, city council members said in a meeting on Tuesday, after receiving a letter of concern about the issue from the First Nation.

Morton did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CBC News.

The Lhtako Dene Nation said statements in the book like ""the truth has been turned into a casualty"" deny the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission by ""implying that cultural genocide did not occur"" in the residential school system.

""It just rips your stomach out,"" the First Nation's administrator Maynard Bara said on Wednesday. ""It's just absolute bigotry and hatred.""

Paull voted with the rest of the council to denounce Grave Error and to accept the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Tuesday night.

A motion to reaffirm the city's memorandum of understanding (MOU), which formalizes a collaborative relationship with the Lhtako Dene First Nation, was also approved unanimously. In addition, council accepted an invitation to visit the First Nation's longhouse to hear from Elders and residential school survivors.

In a social media post Tuesday night, Morton said that as the mayor's wife, she cares about truth and that there should be room for the ""good stories"" about residential schools.

Paull said in Tuesday's council meeting that he had not read the book. When pressed by Coun. Scott Elliott, Paull said he did not support his wife's actions and that he doesn't always agree with her.

""You'd love to be a fly on the wall,"" he said in a Wednesday interview with CBC. ""We get talking about things like First Nations, residential schools, COVID and Donald Trump, but at the end of the day, we're best friends.""

The First Nation said many of its members survived residential schools and continue to deal with its traumatic effects.

""The book adds to that hurt,"" Bara and other Lhtako Dene leaders wrote in a letter dated March 19 to Paull and the council.

The book also contests findings of evidence of unmarked graves at several residential schools across Canada in recent years.

""The calling into question of what our nation went through is a slap in our people's collective faces and it is very hurtful to them,"" they said in the letter.

Coun. Tony Goulet, who is Métis and whose father is a residential school survivor, said Morton gave a copy of the book to his mother.

""It's very, very, very traumatizing, it's very, very, very disrespectful to an Indigenous community and especially [an individual] to receive this book,"" Goulet said in an emotional statement to city council.

""And especially with my dad going through residential school ... [Morton] brought up a lot of stuff.""

The book was also mailed to the Quesnel Board of Education, which denounced it in a Thursday news release.

A picture of the First Nation's letter posted on social media by Elliott Tuesday evening has drawn more than 200 comments from community members, the vast majority of whom disagreed with Morton's actions.

Tuesday's motion is the second time city council has had to restate its commitment to the MOU due to Morton's actions, Coun. Laury-Anne Roodenburg said during the meeting.

Social media comments by Morton about the ""good sides"" of residential schools prompted the Lhtako Dene to write to Paull and city council on Nov. 1, 2022 shortly after he was elected, Roodenburg told CBC on Wednesday.

Denialism is ""the last step in genocide,"" according to Canada's independent special interlocutor for missing children and unmarked graves associated with residential schools.

""Denialism is violence. Denialism is calculated. Denialism is harmful. Denialism is hate,"" Kimberly Murray said last June.

On Wednesday, an interim report from an international group hired to provide advice on identifying and locating the unmarked graves of children who attended residential schools said Canada should continue funding searches beyond 2025.

The report from the International Commission on Missing Persons, based in The Hague, also recommended Ottawa ratify the United Nations International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

An estimated 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools across Canada.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the development of the functionality that lets users enable cross-posting and view Mastodon likes in a Thursday post.

Threads showcased fediverse integration at FediForum this week. Fediverse lets users on other servers locate and follow their profile, watch their postings, engage with their content, and share it with everyone on and off their server, according to The Verge.

Notably, Fediverse sharing requires a public account, per Meta's help page.

Once enabled, Mastodon users may access your Threads profile, like, repost, and share your content with numerous audiences. This lets you connect with folks using social media applications other than Threads.

But there are limits. For instance, threads won't show who liked or reacted to your posts from different servers. Users cannot share poll posts, either.

Meta's Peter Cottle demoed at FediForum this week and said that Threads was addressing the issue. Despite the challenges, Meta has been adding Threads to the decentralized social network system for eight months after introducing the program.

""With our beta experience, Threads users aged 18+ with public profiles can now choose to enable sharing to the fediverse. If they do, they'll be able to publish posts on threads that will be viewable on other ActivityPub-compliant servers. Threads users will also be able to see aggregated like counts on their posts from other Fediverse servers directly from the Threads app. If people on other fediverse servers follow federated Threads profiles, they'll be able to see, reply to, and repost Threads posts (if their server allows it),"" Meta stated in its blog.

After testing ActivityPub integration last year, Threads has entered the fediverse. According to Meta, Threads was always intended to be a decentralized social networking app in the fediverse, where federated networking allows users more control over their online identity and information, despite the platform.

In December, the business stated it was testing the functionality on Mastodon and other ActivityPub networks, according to TechCrunch. The tech company describes the fediverse as a ""social network of interconnected servers"" where people can ""follow other people on different servers to see and interact with their content-similar to how email allows people to communicate regardless of the services they choose.""

To enable the Fediverse functionality, go to Threads account settings, choose Fediverse sharing (Beta), and follow the steps.

This development follows Threads' announcement of a new feature, 'Trending Now,' which displays the most popular social media discussions. As TechTimes reported, Meta's Threads previously mentioned this feature, which enables users to browse trending material in the 'For You' stream.

Since its introduction less than a year ago, Threads has added new, user-friendly features to provide a top-tier social networking experience.

With this new Trending Now feature, Threads users may now follow popular topics and online discussions.

In both versions, these widgets appear at the bottom of the lock screen. However, Windows 11 offers better alignment, as the clock and time are positioned at the top of the lock screen.

Windows 11 is getting these MSN-powered lock screen widgets with the March 2024 optional update, and it will be enabled by default for consumers in April 2024 Patch Tuesday. Our tests showed that these widgets do not disrupt the experience and fit with Windows 11's design guidelines.

Of course, some of you may dislike the widgets on a lock screen, but widgets or ""weather"" and ""news"" updates are common on mobile devices, which is why some users might find them useful. Either way, you've full control over what appears on the lock screen, and you can turn off the MSN integration by following these steps:

Once done, the MSN widgets will disappear from the lock screen.

As you can see in the above screenshots, MSN widgets appear at the bottom of the lock screen. The first widget is for weather, followed by stock, traffic, and sports.

On the left side, there's a weather widget showing whether in your location or located selected in the Weather app and MSN. There's even a button to get the full weather report, but that, unfortunately, opens the Edge browser.

Next to the weather, we have a widget for the stock market with multiple slides. Each shows how the stocks are doing with up-to-date points and percentage changes. Then, there's a traffic widget with a little map that shows how the roads are looking in your location.

If there's light traffic, you'll know right away. You can also click for more details, which again opens maps in Microsoft Edge. On the far right, there's a sports widget that tells you the next games and who's playing.

Again, all these widgets open the MSN website in Microsoft Edge rather than the app pre-installed in Windows. That is something Microsoft needs to improve in the next update, but I am told it is being worked on.

Microsoft may justify the new widgets on the Windows 11 lock screen as a new way for users to stay updated on the weather, stocks, traffic, and sports.

By Lee Min-hyung

GOYANG -- Few would anticipate such a smooth driving experience from a minivan, but that is indeed the case when one drives Hyundai Motor's flagship minivan, the Staria. The vehicle is equipped with a hybrid powertrain, which makes one quickly realize that times have changed in the minvan segment.

Once regarded as an unattractive-looking commercial vehicle lacking any clear upsides beyond its seating capacity of over seven, the Staria is now shedding its antiquated image, thanks to Hyundai's integration of the flagship van into its hybrid lineup.

When you first step in as a passenger, you can immediately spot how spacious the middle and rear seats are in this vehicle. But the main attraction is its silent low-speed driving experience. The Staria hybrid comes with a 1.6-liter turbo hybrid engine, offering a maximum fuel efficiency of 13 kilometers per liter.

Moreover, the vehicle's acceleration proves to be sufficiently smooth for navigating urban environments. During a test drive spanning approximately two hours between the cities of Goyang and Paju in Gyeonggi Province, both located northwest of Seoul, this reporter found the vehicle's 245 horsepower to be more than enough for most road conditions nationwide.

The hybrid engine generated less noise than typical vehicles that are powered by diesel engines, but it demonstrated weak performance during rapid acceleration.

The silent yet decent driving experience -- enabled mostly by the hybrid powertrain -- gave this reporter the impression that the vehicle can sometimes be a good alternative to SUVs for those who enjoy frequent outdoor activities or need more space.

The demand for vehicles tailored for leisure activities is growing rapidly here. According to Hyundai Motor data, domestic sales of the Staria totaled 39,780 units last year, marking an 18.9 percent increase from the previous year.

The recent launch of the Staria hybrid also coincides with this growing trend. Hyundai is also going all out to equip more vehicles with hybrid powertrains, as part of its efforts to offset a slowdown in electric vehicle sales.

Additionally, the Staria is making headlines due to its resemblance to Hyundai Motor's recently unveiled commercial vehicle platform -- the Service Type1 (ST1). ST1 is widely considered an electric purpose-built vehicle based on a hardware platform similar to the Staria.

Hyundai Motor expects the launch of the Staria hybrid to meet the growing demand of customers who seek quiet, energy-efficient and multi-purpose vehicles.

""The Staria hybrid boasts a spacious interior and eco-friendly features, and the vehicle will become a key strategic model to attract more customers' attention,"" a spokesman at Hyundai Motor said.",koreatimes.co.kr,news,The Korea Times,,0.1058823529411765,448760060,1,https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/cec648f8c18541c48b12dd0597cfbca8.png,

A hybrid acts as a middle ground when it comes to traditional versus more environmentally sound options.

Running on electricity and fuel, they are built with an electric motor, internal combustion motor, and gas tank.

It still feels familiar enough to the driver who doesn't like too much change all at once. Let's explore the types of hybrid cars available, their batteries, and the pros and cons that are associated with driving one.

Full hybrids are also known as ""parallel hybrids."" They utilize an engine as well as an electric motor to drive the vehicle. You can usually use them simultaneously or separately.

This is the most popular option amongst hybrid drivers. The battery isn't overly large but maintains a small electrical charge. Because of this, it boosts gas mileage.

Typically, full hybrid vehicles can drive by electricity only, but because of the battery size, can only maintain that charge at decreased speeds and smaller trips.

The greatest advantage to having a smaller-sized battery in your full hybrid vehicle is you don't ever have to plug it in because the battery gets charged by its engine.

Like the full hybrid car, mild ones (or MHEVs) use a low-output electric motor and internal combustion engine (ICE) as well. The biggest difference is that they can't be switched on separately.

The mild in the name refers to the slight electrical charge that helps the engine run. Although, nowadays, auto manufacturers are trying a different kind of system. What happens then, is it saves on gas by using energy to make the car's supplementary systems work.

It's also known as the 48-volt system. It can't drive the car independently, but this system normally starts up your vehicle and slows and stops it as well.

As the car is braking, it salvages the movement (or kinetic energy) that is happening as it slows down. This is known as ""regenerative braking.""

The energy turns into electricity and is saved in the battery. The system will take the energy that's being saved to aid the internal combustion engine to move from a full stop. This will help a bit when it comes to saving on gas.

This classification of hybrid cars is also known as PHEVs. As the name suggests, you can plug in your vehicle to recharge the battery.

The electric-only mode has a bigger range than a full hybrid as well. If you were to charge your car for a long period, you could drive for a while without the need to use gas.

You have more choices when driving a hybrid. Depending on the type, it can run on gas or electricity (or both).

They cost less than purchasing an electric car, and maintenance is lower than it would be with a conventional vehicle. This also means you won't have to change your oil as frequently.

It's an environmentally friendly option, and you save on gas (since you aren't using it as much with a hybrid).

There are many style and model options available (as compared to electric vehicles). They are also equipped with many safety and advanced features. Not to mention, the tax incentives available to you when you have a hybrid car.

If you are going to take the plunge and buy a car, (whether it's a hybrid or not) it's essential to read the Buyer Guide, which is typically posted on the vehicle's side window.

This document informs of what warranties are included with that car. Car Buyers who read the Auto Dealer Buyers Guide are more equipped to make an intelligent buying decision.

Check out the MBR Marketing website for more information on Auto Dealer Buyers Guides at mbrmarketing.com dealer supplies.

Indeed, they don't emit as many emissions as classic vehicles, but they do compared to an electric car.

You usually pay out higher costs at the beginning. It doesn't occur very often, but when maintenance or repair is needed, it can be costly.

It's not as powerful as traditional vehicles but surpasses electric ones.

Hybrid batteries are on the expensive side. They are built to last an extended period, so you won't be buying several ones.

Since hybrid vehicles are becoming more common and the demand is increasing, the prices are sure to drop in the future for them.

A hybrid battery's life cycle depends on a few things, but overall, they were created to last. It's estimated to pass eighty thousand miles, and even have lasted as long as two hundred thousand miles.

The way you drive, the model of the car, age, and weight are all factors that can affect your battery. Many auto manufacturers that produce hybrid cars also include outstanding warranties.

Lithium-ion is a kind of hybrid battery. Even though it's energy-saving, it also gives off a lot of power. Despite the heavy price tag associated with this battery, it's light in weight.

The Nickel Metal Hydride Battery (or NiMH) is a popular choice for hybrid cars. They have been around for years and therefore modestly priced. However, they don't store as much energy as the lithium-ion battery.

The Lead-acid battery has been out the longest of the three options and is inexpensive. They have a good safety reputation and are installed in both common and hybrid vehicles. This battery is often used in mild hybrids.

Soon, it will be ""out with the old and in with the new"" when it comes to vehicles in the future. Globally, there seems to be a consensus that car manufacturers will aim to stop making gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles as of 2035.

It will be a newer and greener environment due to less emissions from classic cars. If you want to be more environmentally responsible and you want to help decrease vehicle emissions, consider a hybrid car.",business-review.eu,news,Business Review,Horia Tomescu,0.03529411764705892,448758232,1,https://business-review.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/A-Guide-To-Hybrid-Cars-.jpg,eng-9405780

The Thermal Club wasn't the right choice. - The Checkered Flag,"Credit: James Black/Penske Entertainment/Courtesy of IndyCar

IndyCar is racing this weekend, but not for points.

That's a sentence that hasn't been written since 2008. But this weekend, the series heads to The Thermal Club, a unique motorsports ""country club"" in California's Coachella Valley for a combined open test and exhibition race dubbed the ""$1 Million Challenge"". The first two days of the weekend will feature over nine hours of testing, with Sunday featuring two heat races followed by an ""All-Star Race"" on Sunday night.

But there is one big reason why this exhibition is happening: Texas Motor Speedway's annual date was removed from the calendar, leaving what would have been a six-week gap between of the opening race of the season in St. Petersburg and the following event in Long Beach.

Mark Miles, President and CEO of Penske Entertainment, has his ears open for fan feedback for the series' first major exhibition event in over a decade:

""I think we'll see how fans react. And you know, because you do it all the time, that you'll have a good sense from social media on the fan reaction to the racing... People really enjoyed being there [for testing in 2023]. Maybe raised some of the questions you asked about racing. I hope we've addressed them, and we expect to have a really good weekend that people enjoy.""

Miles touches on an interesting point there. That being the fact that The Thermal Club isn't necessarily built for racing. As a matter of fact, IndyCar has to use a combination of two of the club's three circuits just to construct a layout complete enough to test and race on.

After last year's inaugural test at Thermal, Andretti Global's Colton Herta expressed some concerns with the layout:

""I think it really comes down to tire deg, what people are showing with that... It will be tough to pass, right? A lot of the good braking zones, you're coming off of high-speed corners, so it will be hard to follow.""

Besides the lack of raceable (that's a word, right?) corners, The Thermal Club isn't made for spectators. While there is no inherent problem with that, there certain is an issue when the decision is made by America's top open-wheel racing series to hold an event, albeit an exhibition there. While a made-for-television event probably looks attractive to sponsors and to NBC, I am a firm believer that the best way for any racing series to gain new fans is to get them to the track to see and hear the cars in person.

Nevertheless, Thermal doesn't seem to be permanent for IndyCar. NBC analyst Townsend Bell hinted at this in a press conference with IndyCar headman Jay Fryre and other leaders earlier this week in a slightly cryptic manner:

""I think first it's important to clarify to Jay that failure is an orphan. Success has many fathers. Let's see where we stand on Monday.""

The bottom line here is that The Thermal Club and IndyCar don't have any business working with each other. Thermal is a private country club meant for wealthy people to race cars, not to hold a race at. While I appreciate the need to close a rather large gap in the schedule (one that has existed for the past few years), I can't help but to think that there was a better option out there somewhere for the fans.",thecheckeredflag.co.uk,news,The Checkered Flag,Gabe Perrin,0.2862745098039217,448757654,1,https://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Marcus20Ericsson20-20Photo20Credit_20James20Black_Large20Image20Without20Watermark_m72953-2.jpg,eng-9411275

Here's what to know if your car has an open recall.

Kia has recalled almost 50,000 cars for increased crash risk due to potential loss of driving power, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The recall, submitted to NHTSA by Kia on March 14, affects certain EV6 hybrid models.

According to Kia, impacted vehicles may experience issues with the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU), which enables the cars' charging. The ICCU may become damaged and stop charging the 12-volt battery, which can then discharge while driving and progressively reduce motive power, resulting in a total loss of drive power.

Approximately 48,232 EV6 vehicles with model years 2022-2024 are affected. According to the company, the following are subject to recall:

Customers seeking more information about their specific vehicle should contact the Kia Customer Care Center or their Kia dealer.

Kia advises that EV6 cars may give warning signals when something with the ICCU goes wrong, such as the damage that can cause power loss. These signs include audible warning chimes and one or more of the following:

How to get your Kia fixed

Owners of affected vehicles can go to a Kia dealership to have the ICCU and its fuse inspected and replaced if necessary. The dealers will also update the ICCU software, all for free.

Owners may contact Kia customer service at 1-800-333-4542. Kia's number for this recall is SC302.

It's like having a second set of eyes on challenging, complex situations. The COVID-19 pandemic set the stage for growth in telehealth, but the technology used could be about to take a giant leap forward and give doctors and their patients a better chance for a successful outcome.

The Mayo Clinic has partnered on a pilot with OPTAC-X on a hybrid LTE-global SATCOM telehealth technology that allows doctors to hear and see what is happening with a patient either in the ambulance or in the field. It gives the doctor and the hospital a head start on treating that patient with clearer, more informed communication that is less susceptible to being interrupted than typical cellular communication.

The doctors reported that a recent cellular service outage had no negative effect on the pilot program. The hybrid system operates on both cellular/LTE telecommunications and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) satellite communications systems that allow paramedics to connect with doctors inside or outside of the ambulance regardless of local Wi-Fi or cellular availability.

""We've had just a few cases so far as the pilot is just starting and it's working very well,"" said Dr. Christopher Russi, current emergency medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""Physicians here, including myself, are really excited about the potential and what this means about the ability to come on and help our paramedics and flight team medics.""

Russi said the use cases are infinite.

With the OPTAC-X technology, the medic wearing the device can be mobile -- up to 500 feet or more from the ambulance -- and hands-free. ""I, as a physician, can be there in real time with that paramedic seeing what they're seeing, hearing what they're hearing and guiding them on procedures and just being a second set of eyes on things that are complex or challenging,"" Russi said.

""They've talked about 300 meters [nearly 1,000 feet] minimum if you have a good line of site,"" said Dr. Patrick Fullerton, president and CEO of OPTAC-X. ""The terrain, mountainous terrain is going to be more challenging. If you have regular, flat terrain, you're talking about miles of connectivity.""

He said the cognitive burden on paramedics is extremely high. There are just two of them and one has to drive the vehicle. The other has to take care of a really sick patient.

""What it means for the patient,"" said Fullerton, ""is you literally have whatever physician you need onsite to help you care for patients early. How many times do we get calls from EMS, and they tell us by antiquated radio what they have and their arrival time, which is really fragmented.""

Fullerton said having the ability to see inside the ambulances or from wherever the EMT is gives the hospital and doctors the opportunity to start treatment even before the patient arrives.

""[Paramedics] are on the ground, they have a gunshot wound, and we can help them stabilize that gunshot wound even before they put him into the rig,"" Fullerton said. ""Then we can monitor that patient with the medic and we can see what they see, communicating directly with the medic and we have audio and visual capabilities.""",govtech.com,news,Government Technology,,-0.01960784313725494,448756243,1,https://erepublic.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f55203c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1215+0+1422/resize/1440x700!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ferepublic-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2F2d%2F33ac2a104ed0945e9de8084a0625%2Ftelehealth.jpg,

Sales of all plug-in hybrid models were up 12 percent for the month, ACEA said.

Sales of plug-in hybrid models grew faster than those of battery-electric vehicles in Europe in February, reversing a long trend.

Plug-in hybrid sales rose 12 percent to 72,376 last month compared with February 2023, while BEV sales increased by 10.3 percent, according to figures from industry association ACEA released on Thursday.

Preliminary figures from market analyst Dataforce - minus statistics for several smaller countries -- showed that plug-in hybrids and BEVs grew at the same pace. Full-electric car sales were up 11 percent, while plug-in hybrids gained 10.9 percent, Dataforce figures showed.

Significantly, plug-in hybrids outpaced the overall market, which was up 10.3 percent, according to ACEA. Dataforce figures showed market growth of 10.3 percent.

Plug-in hybrid sales have also surged in the U.S.

Plug-in hybrids, seen as a transitional technology on the road to full electrification, have regained momentum this year as BEV sales growth slows.

Automakers are increasingly relying on them to meet their CO2 emissions targets, with the latest plug-in models recording WLTP emissions as low as 19 grams per km, with more than 100 km of electric-only range.

Critics say that plug-in hybrids are ""compliance"" vehicles that have much higher real-world emissions, because users do not keep them fully charged. The EU has begun monitoring plug-in hybrids with onboard diagnostics and is expected to revisit their homologation requirements in the coming years.

The need to build in separate battery and ICE drivetrains has also kept their costs high.

Executives at Europe's premium brands said recently that they are preparing for stable or increasing plug-in hybrid sales. On Thursday, BMW sales chief Jochen Goller said he expected plug-in hybrid sales to hold steady in 2024, with growth in full-electric models. If needed, Goller said, ""We can always mix in more plug-in hybrids,"" and he cited the BMW X5 as a strong seller.

Audi CEO Gernot Dollner said Wednesday that Audi was reserving a similar flexibility among EVs, plug-in hybrids and ICE models for the next decade. ""We're fully committed to electric mobility,"" Döllner said, ""But if there are waves or fluctuations in the transition we can react to them.""

Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius said at the end of last month ""We think plug-in hybrids will stay relevant for many years.""

In another sign of plug-in hybrids' continued relevance, the Chinese automaker BYD said it would launch a plug-in version of the Seal midsize SUV, its only non-EV offering in its European lineup.

Plug-in hybrid sales lagged the market sharply in 2023, according to ACEA. Sales were down by 2.4 percent compared to 2022 in a market that rose 13.7 percent. At the same time, EV sales were up 28.2 percent.

Market share in the EU (excluding the UK and EFTA) for plug-in hybrids stood at 7.7 percent at the end of 2023, a 7 percent drop from 2022, according to ACEA. In February, their EU share was 7.3 percent, as sales of full-hybrid models surged by more than 24 percent.

The best-selling plug-in hybrids in February were the Volvo XC60, with 4,277 sales, followed by the Porsche Cayenne at 3,596, the Mercedes GLC at 3,399, the Ford Kuga at 2,984, and the BMW X1 at 2,570.

Volvo Cars' chief commercial officer, Bjorn Annwall, said recently that the company was giving more ""love and care"" to its mild- and plug-in-hybrid models such as the XC60.

Stylists clearly have a lot of sway at Toyota, because the new C-HR hybrid looks sensational.

From the supercar-like bonnet and headlights to its steeply raked windscreen, flush-mounted doorhandles and wiperless rear window, it looks like a concept car.

Check out the way ""Toyota C-HR"" is now embedded into the blade of light running across its rump, replacing old-school chrome badges in a nod to modernity.

Lots of cars have a wide-screen infotainment system and digital dashboard. Some have 64-colour LED ambient lighting in the cabin. Few sync the colour and brightness of the car's mood lighting to the time of day - warm and bright in the morning, cool and soothing at night.

Environmental concerns also held sway in the development process.

There are no animal products anywhere in the car - not in the leather-look seats, the hidden adhesives, or the insulation used to dampen vibrations.

The paint is now water based. The amount of recycled plastic used throughout the car has doubled, reducing reliance on new petrochemical products.

The hybrid battery swaps nickel metal hydride chemistry for greener lithium ion technology.

These are all good things. They are also expensive, which is why the Toyota C-HR GR Sport shown here costs about $61,000 drive-away. That's a lot for a little SUV. A hell of a lot.

Toyota defends its price strategy by claiming expensive tech such as pedestrian detection, driver monitoring and fuel-saving hybrid systems are pretty much mandatory for new cars.

Ever stricter safety requirements pushed the C-HR's airbag count into double digits with the addition of a 10th unit placed between the driver and front passenger.

The cabin has more features than before, but feels surprisingly snug for a new model. It's decent from a driver's perspective, but passengers are hemmed in by a deeply sculpted dashboard and upswept window line.

There are no air vents or power outlets in the rear of cheaper models, and no rear armrest at any level in the price range. Score a point for the bean counters. Designers returned serve with a shapely rear that has no space for a spare tyre, and not much in the way of cargo room.

Engineers won their way in this GR Sport by fitting a sophisticated all-wheel-drive hybrid system that combines a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with electric motors in the front and rear.

As in the larger RAV4 Hybrid, there is no physical link from the engine to the back wheels, which are driven only by an electric motor.

The combination uses 4.1L/100km to deliver 146kw of combined power - strong numbers for performance and efficiency.

Cheaper models priced from about $48,000 drive-away make do with a less powerful 1.8-litre hybrid that uses 4.0L/100km to make 103kW of combined power. Both engines are linked to CVT automatic transmissions.

The smaller engine gets the job done without feeling impressive. It's a noisy unit compared to turbo petrol rivals, but you'll struggle to match its efficiency in rival metal.

The GR Sport is a better bet.

Quieter, thanks to its extra hybrid oomph and a bigger engine that requires fewer revs, it's a smooth unit that delivers easy progress.

Toyota's mastery of the hybrid art results in seamless responses from the brake system, meshing nicely with sweet steering to deliver a satisfying drive.

Low-profile tyres on the 19-inch rims of the GR Sport return a ride that can be unsettled over big bumps that ask difficult questions of its suspension.

There are more polished performers at this price - particularly if you consider a switch to zippy electric cars.

The overall driving experience is good but not great, and the dollars involved don't result in a bargain buy. After all, the designers won this war.

VERDICT 3.5/5

Head-turning looks and impressive hybrid efficiency are undermined by a high price and middle-of-the-road drive.

In an indictment filed April 2023, authorities said Dr. Kirsten Van Steenberg Ball, 69, of Arlington, directed her medical office manager, Candie Calix, to recruit individuals to join an oxycodone distribution scheme between 2012 and April 2022.

Over the course of 10 years, Calix's mother, husband and other family members became patients of Ball's practice, and regularly would receive prescriptions from Ball for as many as 360 oxycodone pills per month ""without regard to whether (they) had any actual medical need"" and despite the fact that they exhibited signs of drug abuse and drug-seeking behavior, the indictment says. Calix's family paid for Ball's malpractice insurance.

Ball issued the prescriptions often without scheduling appointments or conducting examinations of the patients, the indictment says. She continued to prescribe oxycodone despite her knowledge that the pills were then being sold by her patients.

The indictment identifies nine patients, including Calix, who received oxycodone prescriptions for amounts ""far more than a person could ordinarily tolerate safely, let alone that they would genuinely need."" Ball reportedly instructed the patients to have the prescriptions filled at an independent pharmacy in Falls Church after retail pharmacies refused to provide the pills.

The owner of the Falls Church pharmacy also was a patient of Ball's, the indictment says.

According to the indictment, Ball continued to write prescriptions for Calix on multiple occasions during which Calix was pregnant, in spite of the risks associated with opioid use during pregnancy.

In 2019, Ball was informed that her practice was under federal investigation, the indictment says. Nevertheless, Ball continued prescribing oxycodone to patients less than a week after she learned of the probe.

As a part of the investigation, an undercover FBI agent posing as a relative of one of Ball's patients told Ball that he was sharing pills with family members, court records show. Ball informed the agent that distributing prescribed drugs is a felony, and advised him against telling anyone else. She also noted she would not include the admission in his medical file.

On April 7, 2022, FBI agents conducted a search of multiple patients' homes and recovered thousands of oxycodone pills that had been prescribed by Ball, according to court records. Ball was arrested in April 2023, and was convicted in December on one count of conspiracy to distribute oxycodone and 19 counts of distribution of oxycodone.

In addition to her prison sentence, Ball was ordered to forfeit $750,000 and pay an additional $50,000 in community restitution.

Ball's practice previously was investigated in 2015, resulting in a formal reprimand from the Virginia Board of Methods for her failure to preform adequate physical examinations, obtain patients' medical records, recognize signs of drug abuse or report positive tests for illicit substances, and for prescribing narcotics in excess.

Ball provided falsified records to the Virginia Department of Health Professions in the course of the 2015 investigation, court records show. After the probe's conclusion, Ball instructed Calix to begin going by the alias Nicole Thomas to conceal Calix's role as both an employee and a patient of the practice.

Calix was sentenced in September 2022 to seven years in prison for her role in the scheme.

This approach, which leverages California's public grid data, can reduce the need for costly infrastructure upgrades and support higher levels of renewables on the grid.

The decision is the first of its kind in the United States and is a major milestone in enabling distributed energy resources (DERs), like solar PV and energy storage, to operate in flexible ways that align with conditions on the grid. The decision was significantly shaped by recommendations from the nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC).

At any given time, the electric grid can accept a finite amount of power export from generating systems without needing grid upgrades. This amount, known as hosting capacity, varies throughout the day and year based on grid conditions. In California, utilities are required to produce detailed hourly models of the hosting capacity for each node on their distribution system (known as the ""Integration Capacity Analysis""). Under the Commission's decision, clean energy developers can use the Integration Capacity Analysis to design an LGP to ensure that a project stays within hosting capacity limits, rather than paying for grid infrastructure upgrades that would otherwise be required. As defined in the order, ""Limited Generation Profiles specify the maximum amount of electric generation a DER system will export to the grid at different times throughout the year, ensuring that the project is responsive to fluctuating grid constraints at different times.""

In addition to ruling that utilities in California must allow project developers to use LGPs based on the Integration Capacity Analysis in the interconnection process, the commission resolved other key issues in its decision including:

The Commission ruled that certified power control systems, devices that electronically control the power output of generating facilities, will be the primary option that developers can use to manage the LGPs of interconnecting systems. The LGP option will become effective nine months after UL includes the scheduling function in its certification standard for power control systems.

Another key issue addressed in the decision concerns the format of the LGPs, specifically how many different export levels a renewable energy system would be allowed to have throughout the year, and how often those levels may change (referred to as an ""LGP configuration""). The decision approves using a 24-value configuration recommended by IREC, in which a system's export levels can vary up to 24 times per year.

As IREC stated in comments cited by the Commission, ""This approach will allow projects to design configurations that take advantage of the specific daily and seasonal peak periods that arise at the project's proposed location on the grid."" This stands in contrast to a competing proposal put forth by utilities that would have limited LGP configurations to no more than one different value per month, which would have failed to capture the important peak load periods during the day, and would have rendered the LGP of limited value to DER developers.

The commission adopted three different formats of 24-value configurations; customers can choose the format that makes the most sense given the conditions at their project site. It is unfortunate, however, that the Commission passed on the opportunity to ensure the 24-value formats align with the precise time periods reflected in the time of use rate it has adopted (for example allowing blocks from 4 to 9 p.m.). It would be ideal if project developers could also propose custom schedules (still limited to 24 changes per year) to better align with local grid conditions and time-of-use rates. Nevertheless, IREC commends the decision overall, as it is a significant advancement for enabling the flexibility and grid support benefits that DERs can provide.

A third, critical issue addressed in the decision pertains to instances in which utilities would be permitted to permanently curtail the power output of a renewable energy system (outside of emergency situations) in ways that deviate from the agreed-upon LGP due to changing grid conditions. Utilities expressed concerns that if grid conditions changed in the future grid, grid upgrades might be required after an LGP project is interconnected to allow it to continue to export power at the levels agreed upon in the LGP.

If such a case arose, utilities wanted permission to permanently curtail power generation from affected LGP-interconnected systems or to require the project developer to pay for the cost of needed upgrades. Aligning with recommendations from IREC, the Commission limited the instances in which long-term or permanent curtailment would be allowed, thus better protecting project developers from financial risk. Such curtailment may only be done in instances when there is a ""sustained load reduction."" The Commission additionally asserted that the utility is responsible for upgrades to avoid such situations. In exceptional cases, a utility may ""apply for a tariff deviation to request permission for permanent curtailment if they believe that undertaking an upgrade is not a reasonable use of ratepayer funds or is unreasonably costly...""

IREC believes that this outcome is a satisfactory resolution that mitigates risk for project developers while providing reasonable assurances for ratepayers. The Commission also ordered the collection of data to track the prevalence of required curtailments and grid upgrades for LGP facilities, and it left open the possibility of making future changes to this policy.

California's forthcoming adoption of Limited Generation Profiles in the interconnection process leads the way for more innovative interconnection approaches that unlock the full capabilities of DERs.

The 2024 Workplace Flexibility Trends Report -- went live this week examining the state of where, when and how people work and collaborate. The report revealed that nearly 75% of respondents say their employers haven't trained managers to lead a distributed team, established team or meeting norms or adopted best practices to support working across distances. Considering that nearly 60% of employees now have the option to work remotely, it's concerning that employers and managers either still don't know how to manage hybrid teams, or they are being reluctant. So, what's the deal here?

Just five years ago, less than five percent of employees had the option to work remotely on a regular basis. Today, the report finds 58% now have that option at least some of the time. But while a majority of employers have embraced a change in ""where"" people work, many have not adopted the new practices to ""how"" they need to do it well.

""The pandemic forced the majority of organizations into hybrid work practically overnight, with no time to consider how to support new practices,"" says Wendy Hamilton, CEO of TechSmith. ""Unfortunately, some businesses are reverting back to in-office because they haven't committed to meeting the needs of a flexible workforce. Instead, organizations need to redesign meeting protocols, tech stacks and collaboration approaches. Returning to office full-time instead of investing in flexibility will hurt productivity, recruiting and employee engagement.""

According to Kate Lister, president, Global Workplace Analytics, the Workplace Flexibility Trend Report elevates the conversation from whether employees should work remotely or in the office to the crux of the deeper issue: how to best support employees wherever they and their teams can do their best work. ""The near overnight shift in where people work gave organizations little time to think about how work practices and processes needed to change,"" she points out. ""Remote and hybrid work didn't create the need for more effective work practices -- it revealed them.""

Lister points out that the problems of too many meetings and too much email existed long before the pandemic. She explains that the sudden shift revealed that managers had not been trained to manage by results rather than counting heads. ""The report reveals the pain points in how people are working in addition to offering nuanced insights into the demographic differences that necessitate bespoke rather than one size fits all solutions,"" she insists, adding that companies should be asking, ""How can we empower our employees to do their best work wherever they do it"" versus whether they should work in an office, remotely or some combination of the two.

The report unearthed six adaptive practices related to work and collaboration that employers can address to support a shift to flexible work and boost employee productivity.

1- Asynchronous communication. Real-time communication outpaces asynchronous collaboration 55% to 45% -- but the majority want more asynchronous alternatives. Despite real-time communication slightly edging out asynchronous communication, nearly 70% of employees believe email could replace over a quarter of their meetings. Many respondents also believe video and images could enhance asynchronous communication with nearly seven in 10 respondents using video messaging sometimes or often in workplace communication and another 22% interested in trying it. Emails containing images or videos are favored nearly 50% over plain text.

2- Interruptions. In-office workers face more interruptions than their hybrid counterparts with reduced productivity. Compared to hybrid employees, in-office workers are nearly twice as likely to be interrupted more than 25 times a day (83% higher), and more than three times more likely than full-remote workers. Nearly half of respondents (46%) indicated that unwanted interruptions more than six times a day reduced their productivity or increased their stress.

3- Unplanned meetings. Respondents consider ad hoc and unplanned meetings to be the lowest value meeting by far at seven percent. In comparison, decision-making meetings were considered the highest value of any meeting type by only 24% of respondents. Meetings related to project feedback (18%), training (18%), brainstorming sessions (17%) and status updates (16%) followed closely behind.

4- Generation and job status. Generation and level in the organization greatly influence flexibility. Managers (44%) are more tethered to an office than senior leaders or individual contributors (less than 27%). Baby Boomers have far more flexibility than Gen Z in ""where"" (74% compared to 63%) and ""when"" (49% compared to 30%) they work.

5- Size of company. Fully-remote is increasingly becoming a small business luxury. The smallest companies, between one and nine employees, are far more likely to allow full remote (23%) compared to mid-sized (four percent) and large companies (nine percent).

6-In-office flexibility. In-office employees experience significantly less flexibility around working hours than hybrid workers. Hybrid workers have nearly four times more access to flexibility around core working hours (71% compared to 18%), greater than three times more access to flexibility in the days they work (70% compared to 21%) and over 70% more access to full-choice in when they work when compared to completely in-office employees.

Hamilton concludes that employers must take five actions to close the gap: (1) check in with employees through anonymous workplace surveys to assure adequate support (2) be more disciplined in discouraging low-value meetings, considering that 70% of employees believe an email could replace a quarter of their meetings (3) invest in asynchronous communication best practices, articulating the best type of interactions benefiting in-person time or a virtual meeting (4) require working arrangement agreements to establish agreed upon norms (5) designate focus areas in the office. While some in-person collaboration is important, two-times as many in-office employees are reporting being excessively interrupted when compared to hybrid employees.

Lester insists that too many organizations are acting on feelings rather than facts. ""Leaders feel people are less productive and less engaged when they are not in the office. They feel their culture and innovation are suffering,"" she notes, concluding, ""But the research overwhelmingly shows giving people flexibility in where they work has a positive impact on not just people performance but organizational performance as well.""",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.08235294117647052,448754007,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/61f7d0658ba8f82e488fba36/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,eng-9418958

In this post, we provide step-by-step guidance on how to get started with near real-time operational analytics using this feature. This post is a continuation of the zero-ETL series that started with Getting started guide for near-real time operational analytics using Amazon Aurora zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift.

Challenges

Customers across industries today are looking to use data to their competitive advantage and increase revenue and customer engagement by implementing near real time analytics use cases like personalization strategies, fraud detection, inventory monitoring, and many more. There are two broad approaches to analyzing operational data for these use cases:

The zero-ETL integration is focused on simplifying the latter approach.

The extract, transform, and load (ETL) process has been a common pattern for moving data from an operational database to an analytics data warehouse. ELT is where the extracted data is loaded as is into the target first and then transformed. ETL and ELT pipelines can be expensive to build and complex to manage. With multiple touchpoints, intermittent errors in ETL and ELT pipelines can lead to long delays, leaving data warehouse applications with stale or missing data, further leading to missed business opportunities.

Alternatively, solutions that analyze data in-place may work great for accelerating queries on a single database, but such solutions aren't able to aggregate data from multiple operational databases for customers that need to run unified analytics.

Zero-ETL

Unlike the traditional systems where data is siloed in one database and the user has to make a trade-off between unified analysis and performance, data engineers can now replicate data from multiple RDS for MySQL databases into a single Redshift data warehouse to derive holistic insights across many applications or partitions. Updates in transactional databases are automatically and continuously propagated to Amazon Redshift so data engineers have the most recent information in near real time. There is no infrastructure to manage and the integration can automatically scale up and down based on the data volume.

At AWS, we have been making steady progress towards bringing our zero-ETL vision to life. The following sources are currently supported for zero-ETL integrations:

When you create a zero-ETL integration for Amazon Redshift, you continue to pay for underlying source database and target Redshift database usage. Refer to Zero-ETL integration costs (Preview) for further details.

With zero-ETL integration with Amazon Redshift, the integration replicates data from the source database into the target data warehouse. The data becomes available in Amazon Redshift within seconds, allowing you to use the analytics features of Amazon Redshift and capabilities like data sharing, workload optimization autonomics, concurrency scaling, machine learning, and many more. You can continue with your transaction processing on Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora while simultaneously using Amazon Redshift for analytics workloads such as reporting and dashboards.

The following diagram illustrates this architecture.

Let's consider TICKIT, a fictional website where users buy and sell tickets online for sporting events, shows, and concerts. The transactional data from this website is loaded into an Amazon RDS for MySQL 8.0.28 (or higher version) database. The company's business analysts want to generate metrics to identify ticket movement over time, success rates for sellers, and the best-selling events, venues, and seasons. They would like to get these metrics in near real time using a zero-ETL integration.

The integration is set up between Amazon RDS for MySQL (source) and Amazon Redshift (destination). The transactional data from the source gets refreshed in near real time on the destination, which processes analytical queries.

You can use either the serverless option or an encrypted RA3 cluster for Amazon Redshift. For this post, we use a provisioned RDS database and a Redshift provisioned data warehouse.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture.

The following are the steps needed to set up zero-ETL integration. These steps can be done automatically by the zero-ETL wizard, but you will require a restart if the wizard changes the setting for Amazon RDS or Amazon Redshift. You could do these steps manually, if not already configured, and perform the restarts at your convenience. For the complete getting started guides, refer to Working with Amazon RDS zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift (preview) and Working with zero-ETL integrations.

Configure the RDS for MySQL source with a customized DB parameter group

To create an RDS for MySQL database, complete the following steps:

Zero-ETL integration works by using binary logs (binlogs) generated by MySQL database. To enable binlogs on Amazon RDS for MySQL, a specific set of parameters must be enabled.

In a couple of minutes, it should spin up an RDS for MySQL database as the source for zero-ETL integration.

After you create your source DB cluster, you must create and configure a target data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The data warehouse must meet the following requirements:

For our use case, create a Redshift cluster by completing the following steps:

Your resource policy should resemble the following screenshot.

To create a zero-ETL integration, your user or role must have an attached identity-based policy with the appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. An AWS account owner can configure required permissions for users or roles who may create zero-ETL integrations. The sample policy allows the associated principal to perform the following actions:

Complete the following steps to configure the permissions:

Create the zero-ETL integration

To create the zero-ETL integration, complete the following steps:

You can choose the integration to view the details and monitor its progress. It took about 30 minutes for the status to change from Creating to Active.

The time will vary depending on the size of your dataset in the source.

Create a database from the integration in Amazon Redshift

To create your database from the zero-ETL integration, complete the following steps:

The integration is now complete, and an entire snapshot of the source will reflect as is in the destination. Ongoing changes will be synced in near real time.

Analyze the near real time transactional data

Now we can run analytics on TICKIT's operational data.

Populate the source TICKIT data

To populate the source data, complete the following steps:

The following is an example. Note that the input CSV file is broken into several files. This command must be run for every file if you would like to load all data. For demo purposes, a partial data load should work as well.

Analyze the source TICKIT data in the destination

On the Amazon Redshift console, open the query editor v2 using the database you created as part of the integration setup. Use the following code to validate the seed or CDC activity:

You can now apply your business logic for transformations directly on the data that has been replicated to the data warehouse. You can also use performance optimization techniques like creating a Redshift materialized view that joins the replicated tables and other local tables to improve query performance for your analytical queries.

Monitoring

You can query the following system views and tables in Amazon Redshift to get information about your zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift:

To view the integration-related metrics published to Amazon CloudWatch, open the Amazon Redshift console. Choose Zero-ETL integrations in the navigation pane and choose the integration to display activity metrics.

Available metrics on the Amazon Redshift console are integration metrics and table statistics, with table statistics providing details of each table replicated from Amazon RDS for MySQL to Amazon Redshift.

Integration metrics contain table replication success and failure counts and lag details.

The zero-ETL integration will automatically initiate a resync if a table sync state shows as failed or resync required. But in case the auto resync fails, you can initiate a resync at table-level granularity:

A table can enter a failed state for multiple reasons:

Clean up

When you delete a zero-ETL integration, your transactional data isn't deleted from the source RDS or the target Redshift databases, but Amazon RDS doesn't send any new changes to Amazon Redshift.

To delete a zero-ETL integration, complete the following steps:

In this post, we showed you how to set up a zero-ETL integration from Amazon RDS for MySQL to Amazon Redshift. This minimizes the need to maintain complex data pipelines and enables near real time analytics on transactional and operational data.

To be honest, all the best mattresses these days are hybrid mattresses. If you shop any of our mattress recommendations -- be it firm mattresses, soft mattresses, or cooling mattresses -- it's mostly made up of hybrid mattresses. Our favorite brands like Purple and Saatva all specialize in hybrid mattresses. The only exceptions would be cheap mattresses, budget mattresses, and classic mattress-in-a-box offerings. Beyond those, it's all hybrids around here.

Why is that, though? And what even is a hybrid mattress? Well, hybrid mattresses are the bridge between old-school innersprings and cheap, trendy memory foam mattresses. A hybrid mattress typically has a bed of coils that offer support, and one, two, or even three layers of foam or latex that provide pressure relief. It's a best of both worlds scenario.

As for which hybrid mattress to buy, we've tested them all, and we know what's what. It all depends on what you want within that best of both worlds scenario. Do you prefer soft and comforting? Or, do you want firm and supportive? Somewhere in the middle? Doesn't matter, we've found you something for you. These are the best hybrid mattresses on the market.

Classic

We recommend a lot of mattresses, but Saatva's Classic might be the one we talk about the most. There's not many other mattresses that can please so many different sleepers. This one is the perfect fastball down the middle. Everyone can find something to like about it.

As far as the things that make it a great hybrid mattress, it's got to be the dual coil units. At the base, you've got traditional steel coils. In the middle, you've got new age pocket coils. Together, they give this mattress incredible support. Some sleepers might find this makes the mattress too firm, but for the most part it's welcomed support.

Luxe 12-Inch Bed

There's a lot we can talk about when it comes to mattresses. We can go round and round about how the coils on one feel or the topper on another sits. But, one thing we can't debate is the price of this Allswell mattress. For $400, you've got a queen-sized hybrid mattress in your home. That's incredible.

It'll feel a bit more basic than the other options on this list -- don't expect it to fix whatever problems you have. But, the selling point is its a solid mattress that'll do the job, and it's dirt cheap.

RestorePlus

If you're dipping your toe into the luxury mattress market, I'd encourage anyone to check out Purple. This is the specific mattress I sleep on, and I love it. It's the perfect compromise for my girlfriend and I who prefer soft and firm mattresses, respectively.

Personally, it's a bit soft for me. The Purple GelFlex grid topper always makes this mattress feel squishy. If you want something firm, I'd look elsewhere. That said, I cannot deny it's given me the best sleep of my life. Every night I fall asleep immediately. In the morning I wake up actually rested. It's taught me to love a mattress that hugs you, that you sink into a bit.

Beyond all that, It's phenomenal for motion transfer. It's also quite porous, between the coils and the GelFlex grid, so it sleeps nice and cool.

Snow Max

If cooling is your main focus, Casper's Snow Max -- which is a reinvention of the Casper Nova -- is our favorite mattress for the job. Casper has a lot of strangely named tech in this mattress -- Snow cover, Heat Delete bands, and phase change material. Trust us when we say, the result is exceptionally cool sleep. Nothing is better at regulating temperature.

Beyond that, it's another medium firmness mattress that trends towards soft. So, diehard firm mattress people might not love it, but anyone who likes or tolerates soft will love this mattress. The foam hugs you, but the coils offer support. It's a best or both worlds deal.

Elite Hybrid

We've got a whole story dedicated to side sleepers, but this is one of the standouts. The reason is that it's incredibly plush, especially if you go for the soft firmness.

If you're a side sleeper, this is the mattress that's going to cradle you without letting you sink down to the floor. It's soft top is squishy, but the coil base that makes it a hybrid keeps you supported.

The Mattress

The whole organic or natural mattress thing can be a bit of a rabbit hole. When do we call something natural? Does it really matter if latex is organic? These are subjective things. One thing that's not subjective is that Parachute makes an incredible mattress without the use of latex or foam.

Ok, does that even qualify it as a hybrid mattress? Not sure! But, I'm going to lean towards yes. It's an innerspring mattress with thick layers of material to soften it up. The materials in this case just happen to be cotton and wool.

Wool? Won't that make you hot when you sleep? Not necessarily! Wool is actually a great sweat wicking fabric. (Think of merino wool, which is a great base layer for outdoors clothing.) This mattress just replaces classic derived materials with sheep wool. The result is a natural mattress that's firm and supportive without being rock hard.

What to Consider When Buying a Mattress

Sleep Style - This is the most important aspect of mattress shopping. Know how you sleep and what that means. Stomach sleepers need firm. Back sleepers are versatile. Side sleepers need soft.

Coil Topper - Hybrid mattresses are all just classic innersprings with some sort of solid topper. All those toppers offer different benefits. Memory foams are great for conforming to the body. Latex sleeps cooler, and natural materials like wool are case-by-case.

Trial Period - The more time, the better. It'll take you about 30 days to adjust to a mattress, so don't give up within a month. After the first month, assess how much you really like a mattress.

Why Trust Esquire?

Because we've become the sleep experts of the Internet. What started as our targeted campaign against the endless ""Best Sleep I Ever Had"" stories turned us into some sort of authority figure. And you know what... we wouldn't trust anyone else. The rest of the Internet wants you to sleep on a piece of shit mattress for the rest of your life. Not us. We're only recommending the best of the best, because that's what you deserve.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has passed a decision allowing distributed renewable energy resources like residential solar and battery energy storage to interconnect to the grid without triggering grid impacts that require costly infrastructure upgrades.

Under the rulemaking decision, distributed resources can interconnect as a Limited Generation Profile (LGP). This will enable the resources to join the grid without paying grid upgrade fees and delays related to upgrade work. California is the first state to enact such a resolution for distributed energy.

""Limited Generation Profiles specify the maximum amount of electric generation a DER [distributed energy resource] system will export to the grid at different times throughout the year, ensuring that the project is responsive to fluctuating grid constraints at different times,"" said the order.

The grid has physical limits on how much electricity it can accept from energy generation sources. Known as hosting capacity, this limit varies widely hour-by-hour, day-to-day and seasonally based on intermittent generation and consumption levels. In the case of solar, California afternoons and sunnier times of the year lead to peak generation levels that may exceed grid limits in some locations.

California utilities are required by law to provide an hourly model of the hosting capacity available on the local distribution grid at local node or substation. This hourly report is called an ""Integration Capacity Analysis.""

Under the new CPUC ruling, renewable energy developers can now use the Integration Capacity Analysis to ensure a project stays within hosting capacity limits, thereby becoming eligible for interconnection without triggering grid upgrade fees.

The ruling created guidelines for how an LGP is classified and controlled and sets a fixed schedule for export limits that can be adjusted 24 times per year. The LGP structuring was developed with input from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). It defines the types of power control systems eligible for LGP curtailment, the allowable format of LGP scheduling and how many times per year a project can change output levels, and instances when a utility may curtail power generation.

IREC assisted CPUC in developing the configuration for curtailment and export schedules for LGP. It said the format ""will allow projects to design configurations that take advantage of the specific daily and seasonal peak periods that arise at the project's proposed location on the grid.""

IREC said the LGP resolution ""is a satisfactory resolution that mitigates risk for project developers, while providing reasonable assurances for utilities.""

Gwen Brown, vice president of communications at IREC called the ruling ""a momentous first for the nation."" However, Brown noted that there is still room for distributed energy resource (DER) operation to evolve beyond the look-ahead fixed-schedule format created by the LGP.

""Under flexible interconnection paradigms, rather than implementing a fixed schedule, DERs would be dynamically controlled to respond to real-time conditions on the grid,"" said Brown. ""This approach offers some advantages for the grid operator as grid conditions change and needs evolve. However, the costs of deploying the sophisticated communication systems necessary for this approach are considerable and it may take many years before they are widely deployed.""

Brown said both the fixed schedule offered by LGP and more flexible approaches to distributed energy management systems (DERMS) will likely play a role in the integration of resources like rooftop solar and energy storage in the coming years.",pv-magazine-usa.com,news,pv magazine USA,Ryan Kennedy,0.3333333333333333,448753052,51,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/IREC.image_.3.png?w=640,eng-9410225

To minimize disruption and ensure interoperability between systems facing integration, the agency has published guidance on secure cloud business applications.

""CISA developed this Hybrid Identity Solutions Guidance to help readers better understand identity management capabilities, the tradeoffs that exist in various implementation options, and factors that should be considered when making implementation decisions,"" says the document. While on-premises systems are certain to linger, secure integration is possible. ""However,"" says the report, efforts must be ""tightly coupled with broader plans to adopt zero trust architectures.""

CISA specifies that the document is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of hybrid models, but rather a ""basic toolset"" motivated by ""the need for agencies to authenticate and authorize users and entities to access business applications hosted in the cloud.""

The toolset includes two primary recommendations regarding cloud-based systems. First, ""CISA recommends that agencies plan to migrate to cloud-based, passwordless authentication via either (1) their existing investments in public key infrastructure (PKI) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Common Access Card (CAC) to authenticate to the identity services, or (2) by leveraging FIDO2 and the Web Authentication standard.""

Moreover, ""CISA also recommends that agencies transition from traditional on-premises-based federation approaches to a cloud-primary authentication (italics in original) approach using modern authenticators and open standards-based protocols and relying on cloud services for their primary source of identity when authenticating users and entities for most access needs.""

In urging organizations to put the emphasis on cloud-based authentication and identity management, ""CISA recognizes that this identity transition is a journey"" that ""can require a great deal of planning, resources, and effort."" But, says the agency, ""agencies will find that achieving this mature hybrid identity model is well worth the time and effort required.""

The document outlines several hybrid solution models that agencies can review to select the hybrid identity architecture that best suits their specific needs and risk tolerances. These include, in the order listed in the guidelines: federated authentication, pass-through authentication, password synchronization, cloud primary authentication; multi-factor authentication (MFA) including knowledge, possession and inherence such as biometric indicators; single sign-on options; FIDO2; password managers; and context-based access control.

Each option is covered with a diagram and description of its architecture, a review of security and implementation considerations, and advice for deployment. Regarding inherence and the question of biometric authenticators, CISA says ""biometric authentication can be resistant to phishing when used locally to unlock a cryptographic key. However, depending on the quality of the scanner and algorithm, impersonating someone's biometric data is possible. Another issue with biometrics is the inability to reset or disable a human's biometrics.""

""Agencies should be selective in the quality of biometric sensors and algorithms implemented. Some biometrics, such as voice recognition, should be avoided as they are not secure due to the potential for impersonation."" That said, the report concedes that MFA is a powerful security tool, and that ""agencies can move into passwordless MFA options, such as FIDO2, to achieve stronger security while easing the authentication experience for their users.""",biometricupdate.com,news,Biometric Update,,0.3803921568627451,448750951,1,https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20160147/passwordless-authentication-enterprise-scaled.jpg,eng-9409357

Hybrid work, where people spend time in the office and time working from home, has moved from an emerging trend to the preferred option in this post-pandemic world. But how are New Zealand couples navigating working from home, together?

University of Auckland researcher Dr Joanne Mutter and Associate Professor Kaye Thorn (Massey) investigated the experiences of professional couples who work from home and in the office.

Dr Mutter, a lecturer in management and international business, says one aspect of her motivation for the study was an interest in determining strategies to make working from home more manageable for couples.

""Flexible working has so many benefits, but it can also create this work/life conflict and people can end up having no separation between the two.""

""We looked into the different tactics working couples use to make their hybrid work situations suit them.""

When it comes to managing working at home with your significant other, Mutter says it's valuable to determine whether your partner is an 'integrator' or a 'separator.'

""We found that people tend to fall into two categories - you are either the person who is happy to integrate everything, so you'll be answering emails at night and then going to the supermarket during the day.

""Or you will be a person who likes to keep life and work very separate. You'll like starting work at a certain time in the morning, finishing at a certain time, and switching off from checking emails or doing anything else work related outside of your specific work hours.""

""It helps to understand what your partner is because, for example, one woman who was very much a segregator said in her interview, 'He goes back to work at nights, so I may as well too.' But this isn't healthy from a work/life balance, wellbeing, or life satisfaction perspective, and they needed to talk about how to better manage the situation.""

The researchers also found that some couples were taking extreme actions, such as moving house, because they realised the importance of having separate spaces.

""They wanted working from home together to be sustainable, so moving house was considered appropriate for some.""

Other couples repurposed spare bedrooms and garages or renovated to ensure their space was suitable for hybrid working.

For people who don't have a dedicated office, new rites of passage are particularly important, says Mutter.

""Activities such as leaving the home office in the garage, walking around the block and entering the house served as that 'circuit breaker' that was once the commute.""

Turning off from work was another issue the couples found themselves managing, according to the study.

Mutter says some people would write themselves a list of tasks for the next day. Others, when they were making dinner, would have an 'end-of-workday' catch-up.

""People need to harness these kinds of strategies, or else they won't turn off. You might think, 'oh, I've got all this flexibility, so it's good for my work-life balance, therefore it must be good for my wellbeing'. But if work-life flexibility means that someone is constantly thinking about work, then it's having the opposite effect.""

Mutter and Thorn, who undertook in-depth interviews with 32 people (16 couples), also found that in some circumstances, if one person had more flexibility in their role, they tended to pick up more family and household responsibilities and, therefore, ended up with less flexibility.

Organisations can support employees' flexibility by making sure their culture is open to diverse work styles, says Mutter.

""Some organisations say 'right, no emails after hours', and they think that's good for everyone because they're allowing you the right to disconnect. But for some people, that doesn't work because they want to answer emails at a certain time, although they don't expect a reply.

""If you want to segregate, you need to know that your organisation culturally accepts that and that your boss isn't going to send you an email and expect a reply at 7pm.""

Dr Joanne Mutter and Associate Professor Kaye Thorn's research saw them awarded ""Best Paper Aligned to the Conference Theme - Common Good Human Resources Management"" at the 5th Human Resources International Conference.

Within this project, significant developments are underway regarding the potential acquisition of second-hand steam turbines from decommissioned nuclear power plants in the United States as an economic option.

A group of technical consultants, comprising retired experts with extensive experience in public institutions, now serving as technical advisors to the Holding, has received information suggesting that these second-hand steam turbines may be procured at very competitive prices. Consequently, preliminary discussions and negotiations have been initiated through intermediaries.

The second-hand steam turbines under consideration are two units of 500 MW each, as manufactured by GE and designed for single high-pressure inlet. However, the compatibility of these decommissioned nuclear power plant steam turbines with the requirements of the new investment project at the Afşin Elbistan Thermal Power Plant is a significant concern. Therefore, senior executives and technical personnel have decided to conduct a preliminary study to evaluate whether these turbines align with the pressure, temperature, and capacity specifications of the steam boilers.

As part of this preliminary study, the compatibility of the second-hand steam turbines, to be procured through intermediaries, with the design of the steam boilers will be thoroughly examined. The goal is to identify the most suitable and efficient steam turbines for the Afşin Elbistan Thermal Power Plant. However, several factors must be considered during the selection process. For example, the turbines' single-pressure operation and the need to incorporate large ESP and FGD designs suitable for low-calorific indigenous coal in the new design are significant considerations.

Furthermore, lessons must be drawn from examples where local investors purchased cheap second-hand steam turbines and scrap boilers, which later proved to be less cost-effective or even problematic.

The new investment project by the Holding is regarded as a significant step in Turkey's energy sector and is expected to make a substantial contribution to meeting the country's energy needs. With this project, efforts to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly energy production and to contribute to the national economy are expected to intensify. Therefore, meticulous preliminary studies are crucial to ensuring that informed decisions are made.

Furthermore, engineers from the Holding company have engaged with software developers via intermediaries to seek a design for a steam boiler compatible with low-calorific Afşin coal (approximately 1000 BTU per lb). We have recommended them to obtain suitable software or partner with a software provider. It's imperative to ensure the utilization of a reputable and reliable thermal power plant design software before finalizing such a significant investment.",eurasiareview.com,news,Eurasia Review,Eurasia Review,0.09019607843137245,448748261,1,https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/b-41-e1684366409749.jpg,eng-9411628

The primary factor that causes ecological pollution is fossil fuels because of their use in energy production and industrial fields. No doubt, finding a new energy source has become necessary to reduce the use of fossil fuels and their emissions. Among the robust proposed solutions is renewable energy, like solar and wind energy. The demand for renewable energy as an alternative source is growing. Solar energy is one of the most popular sources because it is limitless and spotless to produce energy without harmful emissions. Depending on the photovoltaic (PV) effect, a solar cell converts the irradiation into electrical energy through many physical processes. Even though all the PV cells have enticing features, their energy conversion efficiency is still relatively low. Figure 7 shows the power-voltage (P-V) diagram for a PV array, demonstrating the variation of the PV power concerning PV voltage under various amounts of temperature and irradiance. It is clear that only under steady-state environmental conditions does the PV cell provide the highest operating point, called the maximum power point (MPP). To achieve this point, we must employ a critical device known as a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. Today, researchers worldwide seek to develop and create new methods to extract as much power from PV panels. In the literature, we can find various classifications of these MPPT techniques.

Among the classical MPPT techniques, we mention Perturb and observe P&O, Incremental Conductance (INC), and Hill Climbing (HC). However, each technique has specific strengths and weaknesses; for example, P&O and HC are simple and require fewer sensors than other techniques. In, a modified perturbation and observation have been proposed to avoid the drift due to the traditional P&O's incorrect choice. The INC algorithm was introduced to resolve P&O issues. In, an improved MPPT strategy based on INC is suggested to increase productivity and efficiency under fast-changing irradiance. Ref, has been proposed an improved P&O using simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance in varying weather conditions and partial shading Nevertheless, the classical MPPT methods and even those developed are still weak under varying environmental conditions and rapid oscillations around the maximum power.

In terms of dynamic weather-varying conditions, intelligent MPPT techniques are often used, including fuzzy logic control (FLC), artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), sliding mode control, and Gauss-Newton method-based MPPT. These techniques are very efficient and faster for tracking the MPP. Nevertheless, they require many data sets to train and improve tracking accuracy, especially ANN and ANFIS-based MPPT; their implementation can be challenging.

Recently, bio-inspired algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm have been widely used in PV systems to determine the maximum power point, especially under partial shading conditions. In a new MPPT called the slime mold golden sine algorithm was proposed in order to address the partial shading problem, the proposed SMGSA method exhibits superior effectiveness and enhancement. Most of these strategies follow an identical sequence or procedure to accomplish optimization. Although bio-inspired solutions can effectively handle the challenge of partial shading, their efficacy depends entirely on the parameters chosen and the starting conditions.

Combining bio-inspired algorithms with other MPPT approaches can overcome this restriction in bio-inspired algorithms. In, an invented P&O with adaptive variable step size based on a PID controller optimized using the Genetic Algorithm was introduced. It shows less oscillation around the MPP and improves efficiency. Ref. has suggested a fuzzy logic controller optimized through the cuckoo strategy optimization approach (COA-FLC) for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) under various meteorological conditions. This COA-FLC has improved the convergence time and minimized the output ripple power. A fractional order based MPPT enhanced using different metaheuristic techniques was suggested in, The results obtained demonstrated a high level of accuracy and increased robustness.

To avoid such improbable and substantial variations during the transitory phase, researchers proposed a two-level MPPT control architecture. In, the ripple correlation control algorithm was the initial loop of control, while the model reference adaptive controller MRAC was the second. The separation of these control algorithms results in the attainment of MPPT while ensuring the entire system's stability. Another solution is described in; an improved model reference adaptive controller was associated with incremental conductance. A set of tests and simulations using PSIM and experimental tests are employed to verify the effectiveness of the suggested methodology. However, most plants have PV systems and boost converters, mathematically modeled as second-order systems. Indeed, the performance of traditional MRAC tracking systems could be better for second-order systems. To improve MPPT performance, a novel MRAC structure has been expanded from the first to the second order.

Nevertheless, one of the significant issues caused by non-linearity is determining MRAC adaptation gains according to specific methods. As described in references, the authors investigated the influence of changing the adaptation gain on the overall system's performance, including the time response and the oscillation in the response. In this article, meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to overcome this difficulty. Two optimization techniques are applied to tune the parameters of MRAC and improve its dynamic performance, namely the genetic algorithm (GA) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). In addition, an adaptable Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been employed to produce voltage references for maximum power capacity, which a designed controller subsequently tracks; Fig. 1 illustrates the block diagram of the developed system.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section ""Mathematical modeling of photovoltaic array"" describes a photovoltaic array's mathematical modeling and the boost converter's mathematical representation. The neuro-fuzzy network and the proposed optimal model reference adaptive controller, OMRAC, are presented in Section ""Dynamics modeling of the DC-DC boost converter"".

Solar energy, in particular, has emerged as a cornerstone of this transition. However, the unpredictable and variable nature of sunlight poses a significant challenge for accurately predicting energy yields. This uncertainty not only hampers innovation, but unnecessarily delays the sun's use in global energy production.

While a solar cell's conversion efficiency is conventionally measured in a controlled environment, its real-world performance, influenced by diverse weather conditions, can significantly deviate. For stakeholders such as solar farm managers and energy providers, the paramount concern lies not in the cell's efficiency percentage, but in understanding its actual annual power generation in a specific location. With this (financial) yield uncertainty, the full potential of solar panels -- and their integration into buildings, car roofs or agricultural applications -- might remain unharnessed.

Predictive models of energy yields currently exist, aiming to enhance accuracy and applicability across various photovoltaic (PV) technologies. But traditional 'grey box' models are often reliant on historical data and empirical insights, struggling to provide the precision required for optimizing solar installations.

In response to this pressing need for precision, imec's Energy Systems team at EnergyVille, Belgium, presented their own model in 2017. Unlike conventional approaches, the model adopts a bottom-up approach -- it delves into the intricate interplay of light, temperature, and electrical dynamics within solar panels, with a physics-based model of their interactions. This holistic approach is crucial, especially as the renewable energy landscape expands into uncharted territories of integrated photovoltaics, such as integration in infrastructure.

The system model weaves together three interlinked components: an optical, a thermal, and an electrical model.

The optical model employs sophisticated ""ray tracing"" techniques, simulating how solar modules respond optically. By also considering reflection or absorption across various wavelengths and angles, the model excels in capturing the nuances of sunlight interaction with different panel technologies.

Second, the thermal model takes a leap beyond global module temperature estimates for solar panels, by factoring in local variations. This distinction is particularly significant for building-attached installations, where adhesion to e.g., concrete walls can be done seamlessly or by including space for airflow. Understanding these local '""chimney"" effects is key to accurate temperature modeling and provides more nuanced predictions.

Last, delving into the core of power generation, the electrical model considers various factors, such as the specific type of solar cell and the presence of (acoustic) absorbing material. It provides insights into the generated current and identifies potential areas of efficiency loss.

""The synergy of these three models, responding to environmental inputs like meticulous meteorological data and positioning, paints a comprehensive simulated 3D picture. Besides the straightforward impact of direct sunlight, factors like elevated temperatures and diminished wind currents can adversely impact solar panel yields.

""The model's focus on local meteorological intricacies ensures a more accurate and dynamic representation of real-world conditions, enabling the model to predict the daily or yearly energy yield of solar cells under varying meteorological and irradiation conditions,"" emphasizes Prof. Michaël Daenen, Principal Investigator at imo-imomec/EnergyVille.

Beyond theoretical simulations, the Energy Yield model has since served as a practical guide for optimizing PV integration -- with experimental energy yields being compared to the simulated ones.

The Interreg Rolling Solar project, for example, focused on the integration of PV systems into public infrastructure, envisioning large-scale electricity generation without the need for additional land. Among others, a concrete noise barrier wall was built at EnergyVille, Belgium, in which existing and newly developed solar modules were incorporated, to showcase their feasibility and measure their energy yields over the course of several years.

Prof. Ivan Gordon, Department Director at imo-imomec/EnergyVille, explains the energy yield results. ""Our physics-based model gave remarkably accurate predictions, especially for crystalline silicon solar panels, within a 15-minute window. With over 95% of current PV installations being silicon-based, you can imagine the value of such accurate predictions.

""Challenges arose when we extended the predictions to thin-film technologies like CIGS modules. In response, we developed a separate electrical model for thin-film materials and included empirical corrections. With iterative refinement, we were able to significantly reduce the error (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)) of our predictions to minor margins. This showcases the model's adaptability to different materials and technologies.""

In a second phase of the Rolling Solar project, modular bifacial solar panels were included in the wall, extending the model's scope again. While bifacial PV systems can generate up to 20% more electricity, compared to monofacial PV, their energy dynamics are significantly altered since photons can enter from both sides -- highly dependent on the surroundings and varying throughout the day. These unique challenges were addressed with modifications in the optical model.

""The key strength of the Energy Yield model lies in its flexible framework,"" emphasized Dr. Arnaud Morlier, team lead of the Energy Systems team at imec/EnergyVille. ""This enables our model to evolve with real-world experimentation and progress in solar panel technologies and applications. It serves as a foundational framework that can be expanded to incorporate different materials and applications, providing insights into energy generation under different conditions.""

A precise energy yield prediction of a specific application offers numerous advantages: a module engineer can assess the real-world impact of technical adjustments made to solar cells without the need for physical production. Additionally, a virtual presentation can aid in optimizing and testing scenarios for solar panel placement, considering factors like angle adjustments. From the design of PV-integrated solutions to estimating its energy yield in a specific location and optimizing investment strategies, the Energy Yield model can be a guiding beacon throughout the entire journey.

Together with the software company PVcase, imec has transformed the predictive model into a commercially available simulation software, tailored for solar parks. The software is versatile, incorporating bifacial and other state-of-the-art technologies, allowing for easy design and accurate prediction of the energy yield in PV power plants.

The predictive model continues to play a crucial role in designing and optimizing curved solar panels for car roofs. Recognizing that current solar roofs offer only a limited increase in driving range, the SNRoof project integrated highly efficient solar cells into car roofs. Simultaneously, the HighLite project explored the development of cost-effective solar car roof modules, aiming to contribute to a competitive EU PV manufacturing industry. Currently, the Energy Systems team is evaluating the optimal placement of solar cells to facilitate the development of fully autonomous electric vehicles.

More recently, building on the success of Rolling Solar, the SolarEMR project was finalized. This 18-month endeavor focused on demonstrating cost-effective automated PV module production and electric interconnection of solar cells, for both building and infrastructure integration. Interestingly, the project also considered aspects beyond technical and financial optimization, such as regulatory frameworks and business viability, paving the way for large-scale PV projects.

By collaborating with energy market providers, the simulation model was used to not only create more efficient solar cells, but also improve installation techniques, and micro-grid stability -- a collaborative effort thus enabling quicker green solutions.

Take, for instance, the profitability of investing in solar-integrated sound barriers -- a venture that hangs in the delicate balance of their placement. With roads winding and meandering, at times veering away from the sun's rays, the integration of PV technology into sound barriers may not always be a straightforward choice. Enter the Energy Yield model, offering insights for the seamless execution of such large-scale projects based on intricate road maps, solar cell properties, and local weather conditions and regulations.

Beyond design and optimization, an accurate virtual presentation of PV-integrated applications can also aid in its operation and maintenance. When an experimental energy yield is not reaching its simulated one, this can indicate e.g., damage to the solar panels or overgrowing grass which needs to be cut, offering a way to detect anomalies. This enables a centralized operating system, reducing the need to visit the solar-site -- beneficial for remote or isolated solar farms.

Ongoing projects utilizing the prediction model involve the improvement of accurate weather forecasting (E-TREND) and ""nowcasting"" (TRUST-PV) with the help of sky-imagers and artificial intelligence (AI).

The prospects for precise solar energy modeling hold immense promise, spanning from individual installations to entire energy networks. Finally, consider this: to guarantee its stability, it is crucial for supply and demand to always be balanced. A simulation model predicting energy yields with a 15-minute window of accuracy, can not only assist in grid management for large manufacturing facilities or urban areas, but can also enable countries to trade energy more efficiently on the international market.",techxplore.com,news,Tech Xplore,,0.2392156862745098,448746724,1,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/predicting-energy-yiel.jpg,eng-9409422

Operational and integration challenges on some of Signet Jewelers' digital banners resulted in lower fulfillment in the retailer's fiscal 2024 ended Feb. 3, CEO Gina Drosos said in a March 20 earnings call with investors.

These digital issues have continued into Signet's fiscal 2025, Drosos added. The challenges with integrating subsidiary Blue Nile with production partners resulted in lower conversion rates in the last six weeks of Signets fiscal Q4. That reduced overall North American same-store sales by one point, she said.

Signet Jewelers Limited reported that total sales for its fiscal Q4 were $2.5 billion. That's down $168.6 million year over year, or 6.3%. Same-store sales -- which include those from physical stores and ecommerce -- decreased 9.6% in the period. Signet began including Blue Nile in same-store sales in Q3 of its fiscal 2024.

For the full year, Signet sales decreased to $7.17 billion from $7.84 billion in its fiscal 2023.

In North America, Signet's Q4 total sales were $2.4 billion, which is a $152.9 million (or 6.1%) decrease. Meanwhile, same-store sales declined 10%, 1% of which Signet attributes to the digital integration issues.

""These issues are solely related to the James Allen and Blue Nile integration and are not tied to, nor are they impacting the ecommerce channels of our core banners which are performing well,"" said Joan Hilson, chief financial, strategy and services officer.

Drosos said the digital operational issues with its James Allen and Blue Nile were related to replatforming.

""Frankly, we thought we had it all wired and that the pipes were connected well but they weren't,"" Drosos said. ""And we had, unfortunately, some problems integrating Blue Nile with its production partners, which caused us to see a dip in conversion with much longer fulfillment times.""

Signet acquired Blue Nile for $360 million in August 2022.

""We are working to resolve these issues and expect to have fixes implemented later this year,"" Drosos said.

Hilson elaborated slightly, saying that Signet expects to resolve the issues in its digital banners in the second half of the year.

Signet Jewelers Ltd. is No. 60 in the Top 1000. It is also the highest-ranked retailer in the database's Jewelry category. The Top 1000 Database ranks North America's largest online retailers by their annual web sales. Before Signet acquired it, Blue Nile ranked No. 143 in the Top 1000.

Early Valentine's Day shopping was down mid-teens, Hilson said, adding that that's consistent with January's performance.

""Since Valentine's Day, same-store sales have improved notably up 2 to 3 points to the fourth quarter and a further point when excluding our digital banners,"" she said.

Signet expects $160 million to $180 million in 2024 capital expenditures, Hilson said. That includes opening 20 to 30 new stores and renovating about 300 locations. The renovations will mostly be for 200 Kay stores and 50 Jared stores.

Signet also intends to invest between $40 million and $50 million ""in digital and technology in support of our consumers and team member experiences,"" including connected commerce capabilities.

In the U.K., Signet is closing up to 30 Ernest Jones locations as part of an effort to shift those sales to digital, Hilson said.

Social scientists often describe the integration of Russian-speaking Estonians as a bilateral process, dependent also on ethnic Estonians' readiness to accept Russians into their midst. Martin Ehala, editor of Fookus, suggests this view is oversimplified.

Integration, in fact, involves three parties, the third being Vladimir Putin himself, or more specifically, his identity politics. Estonian citizenship data vividly illustrates this point.

Number of Russian citizens is growing

An analysis of the citizenship dynamics among Russian-speaking individuals in Estonia based on three census data (2000, 2011, 2021) reveals significant trends, particularly when breaking down the data by generations and observing the changes in the number of Estonian and Russian citizens in each generation over two decades.

Generations are categorized into six, starting with the oldest, the Stalin-era generation, comprising individuals born before World War II. This group initially had a higher count of Russian citizens, though it has largely diminished over the last 20 years (refer to chart).

This trend of the number of Russian citizens increasing over the past 20 years also characterizes younger generations who are not yet nearing the end of their natural lifespan.

The post-war generation comprises people born between 1941-1955. At the time of the 2000 census, they were aged 45-60, and by the 2021 census, aged 65-80. This generation too has seen a decline over the last decade due to natural mortality, resulting in a decrease in both Estonian and Russian citizens compared to 2011. Importantly, between the 2000 and 2011 censuses, the share of Russian citizens in this generation rose by 26 percent.

This trend of the number of Russian citizens increasing over the past 20 years also characterizes younger generations who are not yet nearing the end of their natural lifespan. The percentage increases are staggering: in the generation born during the Thaw (1956-1970), the share of Russian citizens increased by 36 percent between the censuses; in the generation born during the Era of Stagnation (1971-1985) by 35 percent, in the post-Soviet generation (born 1986-2000) by a notable 46 percent, and in the youngest, the 21st-century generation (born 2000-2011) by 7 percent.

Although the absolute numbers are not exceedingly high (none of the four younger generations have as many Russian citizens as the two older generations once did). The younger generations' shift towards Russian citizenship does not make up for the decline in Russian citizens among older generations (from 86,000 to 81,000 this century). The notable choice of Russian citizenship by many young people born after Estonia's re-independence, along with the increasing trend, warrants an explanation.

Number of Estonian citizens in decline among the Russian-speaking community

It appears that the increase in the number of people with Russian citizenship during the interval between censuses is not only because stateless individuals have opted for Russian citizenship, but there is also a noticeable trend of renouncing Estonian citizenship, particularly in the post-Soviet generation. However, the pattern is more complex.

At the start of the 21st century, younger generations were actively acquiring Estonian citizenship - between 2000 and 2011, it increased by 32 percent in the post-Soviet generation and by 20 percent in the Stagnation Era generation. In contrast, between 2011 and 2021, there has been a slight reversal in all generations, with the largest in the post-Soviet generation at 9 percent. Notably, even the youngest generation, whose members automatically obtain Estonian citizenship if their parents are stateless permanent residents of Estonia, experienced a slight decline (1.5 percent).

It is important to note that all generations of Russian descent have decreased in size over 20 years, likely due to emigration. Changes in national self-identification among some individuals cannot be ruled out, either. Considering these factors, the renunciation of Estonian citizenship in the post-Soviet generation drops to about five percent, and in other generations, the decrease is likely not due to renunciation of Estonian citizenship.

Factors behind integration dynamics

The integration of Russian Estonians has undoubtedly depended on both Estonia's integration policy and Estonia's broader success story. However, as Ilmar Raag points out, for the Russian-speaking community in Estonia, integration means choosing between the Estonian and Russian identity narratives. Putin's identity politics might be a stronger factor than Estonia's integration policy and economic success combined.

When it comes to the integration of non-ethnic Estonians throughout the entire history since Estonia's re-independence, it can be observed that integration was most active when Russia was relatively chaotic both economically and socially, while Estonia was developing rapidly in all areas - namely, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was also a time when Russians had little to be proud of - the Soviet Union had collapsed, the project of communism had failed, and the horrific crimes of totalitarianism had been exposed to the public.

Integration was most active when Russia was relatively chaotic both economically and socially, while Estonia was developing rapidly in all areas - namely, in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The turning point came around 2004 when Putin began transforming the victory in World War II into a grand historical act of heroism for the Russian people. This was also the time when Putin's identity politics began to stir around the Bronze Soldier in Estonia. The consequences of this for the integration of the Russian-speaking community fully manifested between the 2011 and 2021 censuses, during which a significant increase in the acquisition of Russian citizenship in younger generations, along with some renunciation of Estonian citizenship, could be observed.

The effects of the war in Ukraine are presently difficult to gauge. Reportedly, there are people seeking to renounce their Russian citizenship, which is not possible under the current circumstances. Among those aged under 50, the number of people with Russian citizenship had not changed by the beginning of 2023. However, some insight is provided by the latest integration monitoring survey.

Integration monitoring data

Traditionally, Estonian integration monitoring has considered citizenship as an indicator of integration. However, the latest 2023 monitoring survey hypothesizes that neither citizenship nor language proficiency accurately reflects the degree of integration, as there are many individuals with Estonian citizenship among the Russian-speaking community who are quite critical of Estonia. The monitoring refers to this group as ""weakly integrated, critical, and active."" According to the survey, they account for 15 percent, and 60 percent of the group are Estonian citizens, with a higher than average proportion of people with higher education and women in this cluster.

Alongside, there is a considerable number of locally integrated individuals who are satisfied with Estonia, even if they do not speak Estonian. The survey calls them ""locally integrated patriots,"" omitting what kind of patriots they are. This cluster covered 23 percent of the respondents, with a higher proportion in East-Viru County. 26 percent of them have Russian citizenship, 20 percent are stateless, and 37 percent are Estonian citizens.

It is quite certain that obtaining honest opinions from Russian-speaking individuals about their sentiments during the war in Ukraine is difficult, especially if the person has Russian citizenship, as those with views against the state could be deported to Russia. In this regard, people with Estonian citizenship find it easier to express their views, as deportation is not a direct risk for them.

It is quite certain that obtaining honest opinions from Estonian Russian-speaking individuals about their sentiments during the war in Ukraine is difficult, especially if the person has Russian citizenship, as those with views against the state could be deported to Russia.

Therefore, the dynamics of fear might explain why a large portion of Russian citizens and stateless persons appeared generally more positive towards Estonia in the integration monitoring survey than some well-educated Estonian citizens of Russian descent with good Estonian language skills. However, the positive sentiment displayed to researchers could be as far removed from actual sentiment as day is from night.

The latest monitoring survey likely paints an unrealistically rosy picture of the integration of the Russian-speaking community.

Hence, the latest monitoring survey likely paints an unrealistically rosy picture of the integration of the Russian-speaking community. It is highly probable that the so-called ""locally integrated patriots"" are largely as critical internally as the 15 percent, the ""weakly integrated, critical, and active."" And together with the cluster of ""unintegrated passively opposing"" individuals (28 percent), the proportion of dissatisfied and oppositional individuals among the Russian-speaking community is currently 66 percent, or two-thirds.

The future of integration depends on the fate of Russia

Summarizing the impact of Putin's rule's on the integration of the Russian-speaking community, the direct and stark conclusion is that it has hindered integration and increased the proportion of people identifying with Russia in all younger generations to such an extent that it has almost compensated for the Soviet-identified Stalin-era and post-war generations passing away.

Although the younger generations of the community have improved their Estonian language skills, the acquisition of Estonian citizenship has ceased and even turned into more Estonian citizenships being renounced. Meanwhile, the acquisition of Russian citizenship has shown consistent growth over the last 20 years.

Although the younger generations of the community have improved their Estonian language skills, the acquisition of Estonian citizenship has ceased and even turned into more Estonian citizenships being renounced.

The integration of the Russian-speaking community in Estonia thus largely depends on the fate of Putin and Russia. If Putin achieves his goals, even partially, and there is no purge in Russia due to the war in Ukraine, we can expect to see a continuation of increasing opposition in Estonia, intensifying further in response to any stringent policies Estonia might adopt towards its Russian-speaking residents. Temporarily removing the right to vote may not yield the desired result.

A meaningful shift in integration may only arise if the war in Ukraine triggers a reevaluation in Russia akin to that caused by the Soviet Union's collapse -- when a dialogue emerges on the war's immorality and its grievous toll on both Russia and Ukraine, essentially putting the Russian chauvinistic and imperialist identity into crisis. Whether and when this will happen is currently impossible to predict.

Prowind will not be moving forward with its wind turbine project in the Cassel and Innerkip areas of East Zorra-Tavistock.

A well-behaved, standing-room-only crowd of about 120 people attended Wednesday's East Zorra-Tavistock meeting in Hickson to hear presentations from Helmut Schneider, Prowind's Vice-President of Renewable Energy, and local farmer David Cunningham from Wind Concerns EZT.

A resolution was passed by council saying, ""Be it resolved that the Township of East Zorra-Tavistock declares itself to be an unwilling host for wind turbine developments."" Councillor Jeremy Smith asked for a recorded vote, and it was passed unanimously followed by loud cheers from most in the gallery.

Councillor Steven Van Wyk declared a conflict of interest and was not in chambers for the presentations, discussions, or the vote. He is employed by Stubbe's Precast in Hickson, the company that supplied concrete to the Gunn's Hill wind project and could have potentially done the same for any EZT wind farms.

After a few minutes of discussion on if and how council should proceed with a potential resolution, clerk Will Jaques read the motion which was followed by words from Mayor Phil Schaefer. ""I believe that renewable energy is important, and I also believe wind turbines may form a part of that. But I don't understand why the most valuable farmland in the township and the county would be proposed for a massive wind turbine development. It produces energy, yes, intermittently, but it also produces division. It pits neighbour against neighbour and puts a price on friendship. I will support this resolution.""

After his presentation, Cunningham asked council to pass a resolution declaring the township as an unwilling host and in the end, that is exactly what happened. He said he's thrilled council made their decision so quickly, not letting the issue linger on and cause anxiety. ""A little unexpected. I thought they might take a day or two to consider it and then vote, but thoroughly happy with the decision. It supports the community."" His Wind Concerns EZT partner, Rick Hommes, added the resolution was unexpected. ""I thought about it but never expected it to happen. And unanimous.""

Councillor Scott Zehr spoke following the presentations and said the response from residents was overwhelming and he thanked Cunningham and Hommes for their efforts. ""I think you guys did a great job of rallying the community and educating folks. From the amount of emails I received personally, people spoke up.""

Both men agreed the residents in attendance did help their cause. ""100%. It was a community effort, that's what it was,"" added Hommes. ""I am big on consensus, and they saw a small sampling of what the community was saying,"" said Cunningham who added it was a focused effort over a few months. ""Since just before Christmas our heads were down, we were like sponges trying to get as many facts as we could to keep the emotions out of it to focus on the vital few things we thought were important. The community rallied together quickly.""

Schneider said he is disappointed with the resolution and was hoping for more time to build relationships in the area. ""The reason we did not make an ask of council is that we felt it was important for (them) to get to know us and to see if we are sincere in our community engagement process. Do we use this process to make sure we build trust in the community? We did not ask for a council resolution, but it has been made and we have to deal with that."" He added the company will regroup and see what it means for their proposed developments. ""We do have other developments in Oxford and Ontario and for us, it is more comfortable to work with a willing host so that is what we will focus on.""

Despite the company's setback in East Zorra-Tavistock, Schneider said he did have a lot of support for the project with 19 land option agreements for turbines signed to date. ""I don't think it is correct to assume that all the people in that room were in opposition because I did recognize several people who had written letters to council in support of this project. It is a bit of a false assumption, but the majority of people came here because they were requested to. We did not ask anybody to come and support us. We did not think there was a need for that because we didn't have an ask for a resolution.""

One of the lighter moments of the meeting came when a resident shouted, ""Look outside at the trees.

A well-behaved, standing-room-only crowd of about 120 people attended Wednesday's East Zorra-Tavistock meeting in Hickson to hear presentations from Helmut Schneider, Prowind's Vice-President of Renewable Energy, and local farmer David Cunningham from Wind Concerns EZT.

A resolution was passed by council saying, ""Be it resolved that the Township of East Zorra-Tavistock declares itself to be an unwilling host for wind turbine developments."" Councillor Jeremy Smith asked for a recorded vote, and it was passed unanimously followed by loud cheers from most in the gallery.

Councillor Steven Van Wyk declared a conflict of interest and was not in chambers for the presentations, discussions, or the vote. He is employed by Stubbe's Precast in Hickson, the company that supplied concrete to the Gunn's Hill wind project and could have potentially done the same for any EZT wind farms.

After a few minutes of discussion on if and how council should proceed with a potential resolution, clerk Will Jaques read the motion which was followed by words from Mayor Phil Schaefer. ""I believe that renewable energy is important, and I also believe wind turbines may form a part of that. But I don't understand why the most valuable farmland in the township and the county would be proposed for a massive wind turbine development. It produces energy, yes, intermittently, but it also produces division. It pits neighbour against neighbour and puts a price on friendship. I will support this resolution.""

After his presentation, Cunningham asked council to pass a resolution declaring the township as an unwilling host and in the end, that is exactly what happened. He said he's thrilled council made their decision so quickly, not letting the issue linger on and cause anxiety. ""A little unexpected. I thought they might take a day or two to consider it and then vote, but thoroughly happy with the decision. It supports the community."" His Wind Concerns EZT partner, Rick Hommes, added the resolution was unexpected. ""I thought about it but never expected it to happen. And unanimous.""

Councillor Scott Zehr spoke following the presentations and said the response from residents was overwhelming and he thanked Cunningham and Hommes for their efforts. ""I think you guys did a great job of rallying the community and educating folks. From the amount of emails I received personally, people spoke up.""

Both men agreed the residents in attendance did help their cause. ""100%. It was a community effort, that's what it was,"" added Hommes. ""I am big on consensus, and they saw a small sampling of what the community was saying,"" said Cunningham who added it was a focused effort over a few months. ""Since just before Christmas our heads were down, we were like sponges trying to get as many facts as we could to keep the emotions out of it to focus on the vital few things we thought were important. The community rallied together quickly.""

Schneider said he is disappointed with the resolution and was hoping for more time to build relationships in the area. ""The reason we did not make an ask of council is that we felt it was important for (them) to get to know us and to see if we are sincere in our community engagement process. Do we use this process to make sure we build trust in the community? We did not ask for a council resolution, but it has been made and we have to deal with that."" He added the company will regroup and see what it means for their proposed developments. ""We do have other developments in Oxford and Ontario and for us, it is more comfortable to work with a willing host so that is what we will focus on.""

Despite the company's setback in East Zorra-Tavistock, Schneider said he did have a lot of support for the project with 19 land option agreements for turbines signed to date. ""I don't think it is correct to assume that all the people in that room were in opposition because I did recognize several people who had written letters to council in support of this project. It is a bit of a false assumption, but the majority of people came here because they were requested to. We did not ask anybody to come and support us. We did not think there was a need for that because we didn't have an ask for a resolution.""

One of the lighter moments of the meeting came when a resident shouted, ""Look outside at the trees. No wind!""

The absolute content of carbazole compounds and their derivatives were calculated by the following formula: Compound content (μg/g) = (area of compound peak/area of internal standard peak) × weight of standard sample (μg)/weight of sample (g).

The content of carbazole compounds in coal source rocks at the different pyrolysis temperature was shown in Table 3. Carbazole, methylcarbazole, dimethylcarbazole, ethylcarbazole and benzocarbazole are the main carbazole compounds. Figure 2 showed the distribution characteristics of carbazoles at different maturity levels.

There is a close relationship between the content of carbazoles and the maturity in coal source rocks. With the increasing maturity, the content of carbazoles showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. In the low mature stage of R < 0.7%, the total amount of carbazole compounds increased slowly with the increasing maturity, and the total content was less than 160 μg/g (Table 3). From 0.7%R, the total content of carbazole compounds rapidly increased during the mature stage (0.7% < R < 1.3%) and high mature stage (1.3% < R < 2.0%), and reached its maximum (10,668.5 μg/g) at 1.48%R. With the maturity continued to increase, the total content of carbazole compounds began to decrease rapidly after reaching the maximum. In the over-mature stage (R > 2.0%), the total content of carbazole compounds was only 48.42 μg/g at 2.26% R. In the stage of R > 3.0%, carbazole compounds were hardly detected in the samples.

The content of various derivatives of carbazole compounds also exhibited similar changes, including carbazole (Fig. 3a), methylcarbazole isomers (Fig. 3b), dimethylcarbazole isomers (Fig. 3c,d), ethylcarbazole (Fig. 3e), and benzocarbazole isomers (Fig. 3f). In the low mature stage, the content of carbazole, methylcarbazoles, dimethylcarbazoles, ethylcarbazole and benzocarbazoles were all lower than 70 μg/g (Fig. 3a). Among all the carbazole compounds, dimethylcarbazoles and ethylcarbazole showed the highest (maximum 67.32 μg/g) and lowest (lower than 2 μg/g) content, respectively. Ethylcarbazole, dimethylcarbazoles and methylcarbazoles were rapidly generated in the mature stage, with maximum values of 19.53 μg/g (1.2%R), 1233.47 μg/g (1.33%R) and 2878.16 μg/g (1.48%R), respectively. Carbazole and benzocarbazoles were rapidly generated in the high mature stage, and both reached the maximum values at 1.48%R, and the corresponding maximum of their content were 6686.10 μg/g and 355.48 μg/g, respectively. Cleeg et al. discovered that the concentrations of carbazole, methylcarbazoles, C-carbazoles, benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[c]carbazole increase signicantly and eventually reach a maximum at 360 °C (1.4% R) during the hydration and pyrolysis of organic rich source rocks in the Ghareb Formation (Upper Cretaceous, Jordan). With the increasing maturity, the content of carbazole compounds rapidly decreased after reaching their maximum. At 2.26%R, except for carbazole, with content of 25.95 μg/g, the content of other carbazole compounds were below 10 μg/g. The content of ethylcarbazole and dimethylcarbazoles began to decrease after reaching the maximum earlier. Thermal stress may cause the alkyl side chain to crack, and even converted into methylcarbazoles or the product of intramolecular rearrangement. From the perspective of chemical stability, the more and longer the branches connected by carbon sites, the more likely to break. The carbazole content increased sharply at 1.33%R, indicating that the carbazole may be partially derived from the product formed by the demethylation of ethylcarbazole and dimethylcarbazoles. When the content of carbazole compounds reached its maximum, the content showed a trend of carbazole > methylcarbazoles > dimethylcarbazoles > benzocarbazoles > ethylcarbazole, alkylcarbazoles > alkylbenzocarbazoles. However, both dimethylcarbazoles and methylcarbazoles were higher than carbazole in the early mature stage (R < 1.20%), which may be a result of the initial exfoliation of hydrocarbon in the samples rather than related to thermally-induced selective alkylation and dealkylation.

The change law of the content of carbazole compounds depends on the rate of formation and cleavage of carbazole compounds with the increasing maturity. When the formation rate is higher than the cleavage rate, the content increases, otherwise it decreases. The main formation stage of carbazoles is later than that of hydrocarbon generation, but its formation curve is close to that of hydrocarbon generation. The content of carbazole compounds is relatively low in the low mature stage, and rapidly increases in the mature and high mature stages. However, carbazole compounds are almost undetectable in coal source rocks after the over mature stage. It can be seen that carbazole compounds may not be completely inherited from organic sediments, and their content increases significantly with the appearance of the main hydrocarbon generation period. According to the theory of kerogen oil generation, under certain thermal maturation conditions, cracking can occur and oil generation can begin. Therefore, carbazole nitrogen-containing compounds may also be based on a certain degree of maturity, and they may also arise from cracking. This article argues that maturation plays a key role in controlling carbazole distributions in coal source rocks.

In addition to carbazole, methylcarbazoles is also the main component of carbazole compounds. Methylcarbazoles can be divided into four isomers according to the different conditions of carbon site substitution by methyl, namely 1-MCA, 2-MCA, 3-MCA and 4-MCA. The GC/MS data of carbazole compounds showed that the content of methylcarbazole isomers also changed regularly with the increasing maturity (Fig. 3b). In the low mature stage, the content of the four methylcarbazole isomers were all below 20 μg/g, with 1-methylcarbazole as the highest(17.55 μg/g), followed by 4-MCA, 3-MCA and 2-MCA. The distribution characteristics of 2-, 3-, and 4-MCA isomers showed an asymmetric ""∨"" type in the low mature stage (Fig. 4). In the mature stage, the content of methylcarbazoles increased rapidly, with 1-MCA (38-680 μg/g) and 2-MCA (16-600 μg/g) increasing rapidly. The content of 1-MCA had an advantage at the stage of R < 1.3%, while the content of 4-MCA gradually decreased and became the lowest. After entering the high mature stage, 2-MCA generated at a faster rate, and the content gradually exceeded 1-MCA. At this time, the distribution characteristics of the three isomers of 2-, 3-, and 4-MCA were asymmetric ""∧"" type (Fig. 4). The content of the four methylcarbazole isomers all reached the maximum at 1.48%R. Among the methylcarbazole isomers, the content of 2-MCA was the highest (maximum 986.31 μg/g), followed by the content of 1-MCA (744.85 μg/g), and the content of 4-MCA was lowest (505.24 μg/g). With the maturity continued to increase, the content of the four isomers decreased rapidly at the stage of R > 1.48%, and the content of the four isomers were all lower than 4 μg/g at 2.26%R. The methylcarbazole isomers were almost undetectable at 3.0%R. Zhang et al. studied the Tertiary source rocks in the salt lacustrine facies environment of the Qaidam Basin, suggesting that 1-MCA in methylcarbazoles is the isomer with the highest content among the four isomers regardless of maturity. Li et al. believed that 1-MCA is the isomer with the lowest content and 4-MCA is the isomer with the highest content in the shale from Liaohe Basin. Source rock type and depositional environment have a great influence on the content and composition distribution characteristics of methylcarbazoles.

With the increasing maturity, the relative abundance of 2-MCA gradually increased from 19 to 37%, with a large change range. The relative abundance of 4-MCA gradually decreased from 28 to 17% (Fig. 5). The relative abundance of 1-MCA gradually increased from 31 to 45%, then gradually decreased to 27%, and the maximum relative abundance appeared at 1.11%R. The relative abundance of 3-MCA varied only between 16 and 22%, and the variation range was relatively small (Table 3).

Dimethylcarbazoles can be divided into shielded isomers (the H atoms at the 1-carbon position and the 8-carbon position are substituted by alkyl groups, referred to as G1 type), semi-shielded isomers (only the H atoms at the 1-carbon position are substituted by alkyl groups, referred to as G2 type), and exposed isomers (the H atoms at the 1-carbon position and the 8-carbon position are not substituted by alkyl groups, referred to as G3 type) based on the position of carbon substituted by alkyl groups.

With the increasing maturity, the total content of shielded isomers, semi-shielded isomers and exposed isomers all first increasing and then decreasing (Fig. 6a). In the low mature stage, the total content of the three types of isomers were all lower than 40 μg/g. After entering the mature stage, the content of the three isomers increased rapidly, and the content all reached the maximum at 1.33%R (maximum 76.94 μg/g, 664.90 μg/g and 498.95 μg/g, respectively). With the maturity continued to increase, the content of the three isomers began to decrease rapidly, and the content of the three isomers were all below 4 μg/g at 2.26%R. The content of semi shielded isomers and shielded isomers were the highest and lowest within the entire maturity range. The exposed isomers show higher abundance compared to the shielded isomers, which is consistent with the thermodynamic equilibrium principle. From a chemical perspective, the chemical stability of the exposed isomer is higher than that of the shielded isomers.

In the dimethylcarbazoles, the ratio of shielded isomers to semi-shielded isomers content remained essentially unchanged, varying only between 0.09 and 0.12 over the entire maturity range (Fig. 6b). G1/G3 and G2/G3 showed a large change in the maturity stage, which first increasing and then decreasing, and reached maximum at 1.11%R.

The content of each monomer isomer of dimethylcarbazoles was lower than 10 μg/g in the low mature stage (Table 3), and all increased rapidly in the mature stage. Except that the content of 1-EC reached the maximum at 1.20%R, the rest of the dimethylcarbazole isomers are either exposed isomers (2,6-DMCA and 2,4-DMCA), shielded isomers (1,8-DMCA), or semi-shielded isomers (1,7-DMCA and 1,3-DMCA), with maximum at 1.33%R. At this stage, the content of 1,7-DMCA is the highest (153.80 μg/g) and the content of 3,4-DMCA is the lowest (18.96 μg/g) (Table 3). With the maturity continued to increase, the content of dimethylcarbazole isomers decreased rapidly. The content of each dimethyl isomer is below 1 μg/g, and dimethylcarbazole isomers were almost undetectable in the samples at 2.26%R (Fig. 3c-e).

Over the entire maturity range, the content of 1,7-DMCA, 1,6-DMCA, and 2,6-DMCA were higher than those of 1,2-DMCA, 1,3-DMCA, and 2,3-DMCA replaced by symmetric carbon sites, while the content of 2,4-DMCA and 2,5-DMCA were basically the same (Table 3). 1,7-DMCA and 2,7-DMCA existed with the highest abundance in semi-shielded and exposed isomers, respectively, followed by 1,6-DMCA and 2,6-DMCA. However, those isomers with adjacent substituents such as 1,2-DMCA, 2,3-DMCA, and 3,4-DMCA were always detected with less abundance. The general distribution of C-carbazole is similar to the reported studies.

With the increasing maturity, the relative abundance changes of the semi-shielded isomers and the exposed isomers were completely different. The relative abundance of 1,7-DMCA gradually increased from 7 to 16%. The relative abundance of 1,4-DMCA gradually decreased from 15 to 4%. The relative abundance of 1,5-DMCA is between 9 and 11% over the entire maturity range, and remains basically unchanged. The relative abundance of 1,8-DMCA showed a significant increasing and then decreasing trend during the mature stage, with maximum (8.25%) at 1.11%R However, the relative abundance remains basically unchanged after 1.5%R (Fig. 7a). The relative abundance of 2,4-DMCA, 2,5-DMCA, 2,6-DMCA, and 2,7-DMCA showed a significant decrease and then increase during the mature stage, and the minimum also appeared at 1.11%R. Their relative abundance remained basically unchanged after 1.5%R. The relative abundance of 2,3-DMCA gradually decreased from 4.23 to 2.53% (Fig. 7b).

Over the entire maturity range, 1,3-/1,6-DMCA remains basically unchanged, ranging between 0.79 and 0.88 (mean value of 0.83, the standard deviation of 0.03) (Fig. 8a). Zhang et al. found that the neutral nitrogen-containing compounds in crude oil from the Pearl River Mouth Basin also had a similar situation.

The positive correlation between the content of 1,3-DMCA and 1,6-DMCA is shown in Fig. 8b, with R of 0.9988, and showing no change with the increasing maturity. This shows two points: ①1,3-DMCA and 1,6-DMCA may come from a common precursor; ②1,3-DMCA and 1,6-DMCA form in the same mechanism and at the same rate. Considering the structural characteristics of 1,3-DMCA and 1,6-DMCA, the kerogen matrix with the structural characteristics of 1-methylcarbazole is obviously the most likely to be the common precursor of both. That is, a formation mode of 1,3-DMCA and 1,6-DMCA is formed by the methylation of 1-methylcarbazole at the 3,6 carbon sites, respectively. Theoretically, 1,4-/1,5-DMCA should exhibit the same characteristics as 1,3-/1,6-DMCA. However, over the entire maturity range, 1,4-/1,5-DMCA gradually decreased from 1.44 to 0.39, which was greatly affected by maturity. This may be due to the co-elution of 3-EC and 4-EC at the 5-carbon and 4-carbon positions. As shown in Fig. 2, the content of 1,4-DMCA is higher than that of 1,5-DMCA, and the content of 1,4-+1,5-DMCA is higher than that of 1,3-+1,6-DMCA in the early mature stage. With the increasing maturity, the content of 1,5-DMCA has a stronger advantage over 1,4-DMCA, while the content of 1,3-+1,6-DMCA has a stronger advantage over 1,4-+1,5-DMCA (Fig. 8c). The ratio of 1,3-+1,6-DMCA/1,4-+1,5-DMCA gradually increases from 0.64 to 1.36. (Fig. 8d).

The exposed isomers exhibited a different variation pattern from the semi-shielded isomers. The relative abundance between 2,4-DMCA and 2,5-DMCA remained almost unchanged with the increasing maturity, with the 2,4-/2,5-DMCA ratio ranging between 0.99 and 1.10, with a mean of 1.03 (≈ 1) (Fig. 9a). The ratio did not change due to changes in the content and maturity of the two isomers.

Figure 9b showed the correlation between the content of 2,4-DMCA and 2,5-DMCA (R = 0.9994), and 2,4-/2,5-DMCA also did not change with the increasing maturity. Similarly, 2,4-DMCA and 2,5-DMCA were formed at the same rate, based on the same formation mechanism and a common precursor. Kerogen matrices with 2-methylcarbazole are most likely to be the precursors of the two, namely, a formation mode of 2,4-DMCA and 2,5-DMCA is formed by methylation of 2-MCA at the 4-carbon and 5-carbon sites, respectively (Fig. 10). 2,4-/2,5-DMCA is almost 1 throughout the entire maturity range, indicating the consistency of 4-carbon and 5-carbon methylation in the further methylation process of 2-MCA, and the consistency of 4-carbon and 5-carbon chemical activity.The relative abundance of ortho-substituted 2,3-DMCA was always relatively low over the entire maturity range, so the 2,3-/2,6-DMCA ratio decreased with the increasing maturity, indicated that the content of 2,6-DMCA was more dominant than 2,3-DMCA (Fig. 9c). 2,3-+2,6-/2,4-+2,5-DMCA only varied in a small range of 0.63-0.75, which indicated that 2,4-+2,5-DMCA was more dominant than 2,3-+2,6-DMCA over the entire maturity range (Fig. 9d). The inconsistency of their contents may indicate that 2-MCA has a competitive reaction mechanism at the 3- and 6-carbon, 4-carbon and 5-carbon sites during further methylation.

Most studies have shown that linear benzo[a]carbazole and subspherical benzo[c]carbazole typically exist in high abundance in benzocarbazole isomers, while benzo[b]carbazole is usually detected in low abundance. Except for coal samples containing high abundance of benzo[b]carbazole, the distribution of benzocarbazole isomers in most samples is similar.

Coincidentally, with the increasing maturity, the content of the three benzocarbazole isomers showed a pattern of first increasing and then decreasing (Fig. 3f). In the low mature stage, the content of the three benzocarbazole isomers was all lower than 3 μg/g, the content of benzo[c]carbazole was slightly higher than that of benzo[a]carbazole, and the content of benzo [b] carbazole was the lowest (1.17 μg/g). With the increasing maturity, benzo[a]carbazole was produced at a larger rate than benzo[c]carbazole, and the content gradually exceeded benzo[c]carbazole. Molecular mechanics data on these two benzocarbazoles indicate that benzo[a]carbazole is more unstable than benzo[c]carbazole, thus indicating that the prominence of benzo[a]carbazole is caused by specific precursors within the kerogen. The content of benzo[a]carbazole, benzo[b]carbazole and benzo[c]carbazole reached their maximum at 1.48%R, with maximum values of 158.62 μg/g, 75.37 μg/g and 121.29 μg/g, respectively. With the maturity continued to increase, the content of benzocarbazole isomers rapidly decreased. The content of all three isomers were below 3 μg/g at 2.26%R. The relative abundance of benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[c]carbazole was greatly influenced by maturity, ranging from 30 to 50% and 31 to 54%, respectively. With the increasing maturity, the relative abundance of benzo[a]carbazole continued to increase (Fig. 11), while the relative abundance of benzo[c]carbazole continued to decrease (Table 3). The relative abundance of benzo[b]carbazole showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing maturity, ranging from 15 to 31%, with maximum at 1.11%R.

According to the migration and fractionation mechanism of carbazole compounds, the concentration changes of carbazole compounds have been widely applied in hydrocarbon migration. The above has proven that thermal maturity has a significant impact on the distribution of carbazole compounds in coal source rocks. Coincidentally, this study also found that thermal maturity also affects the ratio of carbazole compounds, but the degree of influence varies. When applying parameters of carbazole compounds with significant differences in maturity, it is necessary to treat them differently and fully consider the impact of thermal maturity.

In the methylcarbazole isomers, with the increasing maturity, the ratios between the isomers showed different changes (Fig. 12). In the mature stage, 1-/4-MCA and 1-/3-MCA undergo wide range of 1.4-3.0, with a pattern of first increasing and then decreasing. The maximum appeared around 1.11%R, and the ratio remained basically unchanged after 1.5%R. 2-/3-MCA and 2-/4-MCA linearly increased with the increasing maturity and showed a good correlation with maturity, which may be potential maturity indicators (Fig. 12a).

In the dimethylcarbazole isomers, with the increasing maturity, the ratios of the content of shielded isomers (1,8-DMCA) to the content of exposed isomers (2,7-DMCA, 2,6-DMCA, et al.) showed a similar variation pattern (Fig. 12b). In the mature stage, the ratios all showed a significant change of first increasing and then decreaing, ranging from 0.7 to 1.8 (maximum at 1.11%R). After R > 1.5%, the ratios remained almost unchanged. The ratio of the semi-shielded isomer to the exposed isomer is such as 1,4-/2,6-DMCA, and the ratio gradually decreased from 2.55 to 0.46 with the increasing maturity. 1,5-/2,6-DMCA also exhibits a significant increase and then decrease in the mature stage, while the ratios remained basically unchanged after R > 1.5%. The ratio between semi shielded isomers, such as 1,7-/1,4-DMCA linearly increased from 0.49 to 3.8 with the increasing maturity. 1, 8-/1,8-+1-EC increased with the increasing maturity, with limit range between 0.60 and 0.82(Fig. 12c). The dealkylation of 1-ethylcarbazole was suggested to have an equivalent mechanism to 4-ethyldibenzothiophene, as the dealkylation of 1-ethylcarbazole leads to the formation of 1-methylcarbazole. If dealkylation occurs, an increase for this ratio can be reasonably expected.

In the benzocarbazole isomers, maturity had a great influence on the abundance of benzocarbazole in source rocks and isomers ratios, but relatively limited influence on [a]/[a] + [c]. [a]/[a] + [c] and [a]/[c] gradually increased with the increasing maturity, [a]/[c] showed a large range of changes from 0.56 to 1.58. Clegg et al. previously reported that the benzocarbazole a/c ratio was initially low and then rose rapidly in the classical Posidonia Shale maturation series from the Hils Syncline, Germany (0.48-1.45% Rr). Harrison et al. observed a similar feature for the Hekkingen Formation, Norway and Westphalian coals, Germany (0.4-1.0% Rr) and Li et al. documented a strong maturation influence for the Duvernay Formation, Canada. [a] /[a] + [c] only varies within a relatively small range of 0.36-0.61, showing limited maturity dependence (Fig. 12d), which is similar to the findings of some scholars who believe that maturity has a certain impact on the distribution of carbazole in source rocks, but has a very limited impact on [a]/[a] + [c]. Studies have shown that [a]/[c] can be used as tracers for oil-gas migration, and their absolute concentrations in crude oil decrease with the increasing migration distance. Therefore, the changes that occur with the increasing maturity [a]/[c] are opposite to the changes that occur with migration distance.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.1686274509803922,448744473,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-57520-1/MediaObjects/41598_2024_57520_Fig1_HTML.png,

In an interview with Sky News, Laurent Michaud, the director of Olympic Village, said the organizers of the 2024 Paris Games plan to provide 300,000 condoms to 14,250 residents staying in their quarters.

""We are aiming to have 300,000 condoms here at the disposal of the athletes in the village. It's a quantity that makes sure that everybody will have what they're expecting and what they need,"" Michaud told Sky News.

""We wanted to create some places where the athletes would feel very enthusiastic and comfortable, so they can have some conversations, discussions, and to share their core values about sport,"" he added.

This reverses the Olympic policy that was set in 2020.

Even though condoms were distributed at the Tokyo Games, athletes were prohibited from having intimate relationships because of the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to prevent the outbreak of the deadly disease, the residents of the Tokyo Olympic Village were advised to avoid sexual relations and to keep a six-and-a-half-foot gap between them, reported the People.

Michaud said the athletes will have to wait until they've left the Olympic Village to enjoy all the champagne France has to offer.

""We have made a village club also, with a lounge, with a sports bar with Coca-Cola, no alcohol of course over there, but it's going to be a great place, so they can actually share their moment and the environment here,"" he said.

""No champagne in the village, of course, but they can have all the champagne they want in Paris.

Washington Post reported that the practice of handing out condoms at the Olympics is not new. About 8,500 condoms were handed out during the 1988 Seoul Olympics to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 70,000 condoms arranged by the organisers fell short and they had to order an additional 20,000.

As per Sky News, the Olympics 2024 are encouraging athletes to mix with each other. ""It is very important that the conviviality here is something big,"" said Michaud. He said, ""Working with the athletes commission, we wanted to create some places where the athletes would feel very enthusiastic and comfortable.""

Sky News reported that the organisers of Rio Games 2016 distributed 450,000 condoms, three times more than the London Games four years earlier, with 100,000 female condoms available for the first time. About 175,000 packets of lubricant were also supplied.

Michaud also shared about the food which will be served to athletes. ""We will have more than 350 metres of buffet with the world food... and I'm sure that the athletes will be very happy to have some French specialities made over here. But the variety will first respond to the athletes' needs for their nutrition and their performance,"" he told Sky News.

""It might be for elections...but in reality they did something for us. It has a real impact,"" said Thulani Manzana, who has lived in Amarasta informal settlement in Alexandra for over two decades.

Manzana was speaking to Daily Maverick as celebrations began in Amarasta on Wednesday night, 20 March, following the launch of the first microgrid in Gauteng, that was switched on Wednesday evening, giving power to 200 households, and 500 people, in Amarasta who had never had formal connection to electricity before.

""You are not going to solve illegal connections when people do not have access to electricity,"" said Tshifularo Mashava, CEO of City Power, a City of Joburg entity.

The Amarasta microgrid electrification project is a collaboration between City Power, the implementing agents of the Gauteng Energy Response Plan, and the Gauteng provincial government, who put down funding to install 1 megawatt of solar PV panels and 2 megawatt hours of battery storage.

The cost of R60-million also includes security features, the boundary walls, paving the dirt road to prevent dust from affecting the efficiency of the system and the electrification of the households (lights, poles, streetlights, cables), and smart meters.

""What the province has done for us is assist us not to overthink,"" said Mashava, explaining that sometimes in government too much time gets spent on planning for feasibility and not implementing.

""This was definitely just a directive on the fifth of December from the Premier. And here we are today.""

Speaking to beneficiaries at Altrec Stadium in Alexandra, Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi, said that when the provincial government (whose mandate is not typically to deal with electricity security) started 20 months ago, ""there were 2.5-million people who didn't have access to electricity. Not because of load shedding, but because transformers were stolen, vandalised, the entire electricity network was not there,"" -- which is why this project is so important.

""In this country, if you don't do anything, you get insulted; if you do something, you get insulted,"" said Lesufi. ""So I'm doing something.""

This is a first-of-its-kind project for an informal settlement in Johannesburg. City Power explained that Eskom has piloted microgrid projects before, but never run it as a mainstream section.

Standing next to the solar panels in Amarasta, Mashava told Daily Maverick, ""It's the first time that as a government, we say, it's actually an option, and it's actually a solution for informal settlements"".

The solar panels have dual technology -- getting energy from the sun on top, as well as radiation from the heat from the ground underneath. The plan is for the solar panels to feed firstly to the houses.

City Power said that the settlement will not be affected by rolling blackouts and, over and above this, the microgrid will also feed surplus energy back into the City Power grid, therefore resulting in a reduction in bulk purchases and further reducing demand on their constrained grid.

Because the microgrid is linked to the main grid, if need be, the main grid can be used as a backup should there not be enough sun -- but Anza Mudau, general manager of grid reliability and expansion at City Power, said that there is more than enough built capacity, so that shouldn't happen often.

The reason they chose Amarasta informal settlement for this pilot project is because this community has never had electrical infrastructure before, or legal connection to the grid.

Despite the basic need for electricity, this community has faced violent rifts and conflict between neighbouring communities in Alexandra over illegal connections, which also overwhelm the infrastructure, costing City Power millions every winter.

""We're going into winter -- all those houses would have no electricity because you'd have illegal connections to a mini substation down the road,"" said Mashava pointing to the rest of Alexandra township.

Mashava said in just one year, City Power had to replace mini-substations seven times, which cost them R500,000 every single time.

""I think energy quality and energy access is what we must do as a country,"" said Mashava, but added that we are not going to solve the war against illegal connections when people do not have access to electricity.

One of the priorities for Gauteng's 5 point Energy Crisis Plan was the war against illegal connections and replacing substations, which links to City Power's 10 point plan to reduce their reliance on Eskom.

Mashava said that along with guaranteeing access to electricity, with formal connections, they must provide access to free basic electricity.

The National Treasury provides a free basic electricity grant of 50 kilowatt hours to households. ""So at least there's revenue that is coming to us. And then they're also able to take care of the infrastructure,"" said Mashava.

Unfortunately for now, Mashava said, an informal settlement household would pay the same tariff as a 10-bedroom household in Bryanston, which is not affordable for most people.

""So we are going to ensure that this is affordable -- between the grant and also whatever tariff that we put in,"" said Mashava, explaining that Integrated Development Programme engagement in April, they will work to get approval from councillors and then the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to make the tariffs more affordable.

Mashava said that this project is just the start. With over 200 informal settlements across the city, they have a ""backlog of electrification"" to get through, and are planning to replicate this project in as many communities as funding will allow

Amarasta residents are partnering with City Power to secure the infrastructure, and there was a sense of jubilation and joy on Wednesday night as 200 households got light.

""But there's an outcry because there's some sections that aren't serviced,"" noted Mashava.

""It is exciting, but at the same time, when my neighbour doesn't have electricity, then what?"" said a member of the Amarasta community who wished to remain anonymous.

Thulani Manzana, who has lived in Amarasta informal settlement without electricity for over 20 years said his community is so happy.

""We've been waiting for this moment for long,"" said Manzana. ""Thanks to our councillor, he fought the battle for us.""

The full document is available to download from the financial reports section of the Company's web site at: https://www.hybridsoftware.group/investors/financial-reports.

Executive Chairman Guido Van der Schueren comments, ""2023 proved to be another difficult year for most regions of the world and for the industries we serve; packaging and industrial printing. Interest rates rose quickly to try and curb inflation but this limited capital investment by many print providers, especially in the United States. In addition, the German 'angst' over energy prices and the overall economy impacted our sales in that key region. While we can't control the macroeconomic climate in which we operate, we can and do control how we invest for the growth of Hybrid Software Group. We're deeply committed to innovation on behalf of the industry, and we listen to our customers' requests to help shape our development planning. With limited growth forecasted for 2023, we invested in carefully selected areas to prepare for future growth.""

CEO Mike Rottenborn adds, ""Wage inflation had a significant effect on staff cost, but careful cost management allowed us to deliver an adjusted net profit from continuing operations that was 137% higher than 2022. I expect to double our operating profit in 2024, as business activity is building within each of the segments, with an optimised cost structure in place and tailwinds from the Drupa show to be expected in the second and third quarter. Our Company vision, 'The Heartbeat of Industrial Printing and Packaging', is what drives the team at Hybrid Software Group every day. We partner with our customers and share their heartbeat as we work together to move our industry into the future. The last two years have been challenging but I'm excited by the prospects for 2024 and beyond.""

Financial highlights

The consolidated pre-tax result for continuing operations was a loss of €1.67 million compared with a profit of €1.84 million in 2022. The decrease in profitability of €3.51 million is due to:

Revenue for the Printing Software segment was €14.94 million for the year (2022: €15.26 million). During 2023 a new contract was agreed with an existing customer which resulted in €2.6 million of revenue being recognised (in 2022 a new contract was agreed with an existing customer which resulted in €1.6 million of revenue being recognised).

Revenue for the Printhead Solutions segment was €11.30 million for the year (2022: €8.66 million). In 2022 revenue for this segment had been severely impacted by the shortage of its most commonly used chip. In 2023 it recovered significantly throughout the year.

Revenue for the Enterprise Software segment was €21.81 million for the year (2022: €22.78 million). In 2023 a five-year licencing agreement with its largest customer ended, resulting in a decline of €3.2 million in licence revenues year-over-year. Additionally the segment experienced unfavourable business conditions in its two most important markets, the United States and Germany, leading to subpar results in these regions and for the segment as a whole. For the segment year-over-year licence royalty income declined by €2.9 million which was partly offset by an increase in maintenance and after-sale support services income (€1.49 million) and services income (€0.37 million).

Gross profit for the period decreased to 82% of revenue (2022: 84.2%), primarily due to the higher mix of printing electronics sales during the year, which have a lower level of gross margin that software because of their manufacturing costs.

Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is amortisation of €0.97 million (2022: €1.17 million) related to intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions.

Research and development expenses includes the capitalisation and amortisation of internally generated intangible assets and the amortisation of certain intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions. During the period there was a net capitalisation of development expenditure of €1.39 million (2022: €2.02 million) and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of €4.76 million (2022: €5.14 million).

The net capitalisation of development expenditure comprised €3.82 million (2022: €4.0 million) of capitalised expenditure less €2.43 million (2022: €1.98 million) of amortisation.

The third quarter of 2022 results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69,000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of €3.3 million which closed in July 2022. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as ""Other Income"" and is not included in our revenue figures, but it is accretive to EBITDA. No comparable transaction occurred in 2023.

Total operating expenses increased by €0.4 million, or 0.96% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to higher sales & marketing related expenditures and increased amortisation of intangible assets.

Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the revaluation of currency balances held at the balance sheet date and the change in exchange rates during the year.

The Company presents EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and adjusted profit when reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Group's results in a manner that focuses on what the Group believes to be its underlying business operations. The Group's management believes that the inclusion of adjusted financial results provides consistency and comparability with past reports.

Additional commentary and analysis of the Company's consolidated results for the year ending 31 December 2023 can be found in the annual report and financial statements.

Companies worldwide face more organizational challenges than ever when overseeing remote device management (RDM) solutions.

Businesses working to become technologically flexible have to overcome the challenging task of keeping tabs on an array of devices across dispersed locations. To accomplish this feat, you and your team must understand the difficulties inherent to RDM.

Everything from security compliance issues to connectivity problems demands you apply creative solutions as you figure out how to stay pliable and responsive through tech.

This article highlights the obstacles associated with RDM and gives you some efficient technological infrastructures to help you thrive in today's fluctuating remote work environment.

RDM covers software updates, security configuration, troubleshooting, and performance tracking.

Organizations like yours rely on RDM to administer, monitor, and maintain devices, eliminating the necessity for physically being present at the device and intervention while minimizing disruptions to business operations.

Implementing a more efficient RDM solution simplifies the deployment and scalability of remote monitoring systems. As a result, businesses can seamlessly integrate remote monitoring systems into their IT environments to improve their efficiency and productivity.

There are several ways in which a remote device management system can benefit businesses.

If your business wants to enhance operational efficiency in the contemporary landscape of dispersed workforces, you have to welcome RDM with open arms.

This type of tool updates software, configures systems, and troubleshoots basic problems, allowing your IT administrators to do their work both centrally and remotely. In return, you may experience a substantial downtime reduction and fewer device performance issues.

Using automated processing and proactive monitoring, RDM minimizes the time and effort traditionally spent on manual device management and teaches organizations to allocate resources more strategically while focusing on core business objectives.

RDM strengthens cybersecurity posture by enforcing consistent policies across devices, like installing anti-virus updates, setting encryption protocols, and responding immediately to vulnerabilities as they arise.

Centralized control delivers rapid responses so your IT staff can detect and handle potential breaches in real time. RDM also helps companies comply with regulatory standards and regulations.

RDM contributes directly to better performance by automating maintenance tasks and supervising remote troubleshooting.

Employees face fewer disruptions and stay focused on their primary commitments. Quick issue resolution and reduced downtime lead to happier employees and upgraded job performance.

Moreover, RDM reminds you to deploy software updates as soon as they're available so that your people always have the most cutting-edge tools and technologies.

Implementing an efficient RDM solution can save you and your staff a lot of money. With self-regulating routine maintenance tasks and decreased technical support needs on-site, businesses can reduce operational expenses associated with device management.

The centralized control RDM offers eliminates the necessity for extensive travel and on-site interventions, further lowering expenses. Not to mention that the proactive monitoring and rapid issue resolution capabilities of RDM prevent small issues from escalating into costly disruptions.

RDM lets you exert unified control over your organization's entire device ecosystem. This approach gives IT admins a comprehensive view of all devices so they are able to enforce policies, implement updates, and address issues consistently across the board.

This not only simplifies the management process but also establishes uniformity in configurations, security measures, and software versions. The centralized control is particularly valuable for maintaining a cohesive, standardized technological environment, even in the face of distance.

In the dynamic landscape of remote work, selecting an effective RDM solution is critical for error-free operations, security, and efficiency.

Here are 10 key features to consider, each integrating zero touch technology and robust data leakage protection policies.

Zero-touch deployment, a method of deploying devices without any manual intervention, allows for seamless and automated implementation across devices or systems.

Zero touch technology automates the complex task of deploying devices, making it more efficient for everyone involved. IT administrators can remotely configure multiple devices simultaneously via this feature, eliminating manual intervention while offering an effortless, standardized deployment experience that keeps up with the evolving tech needs of your team and your work.

Scalability enhancement leads to smooth adaptation as technologies shift.

Remote monitoring extends its capabilities into real-time oversight and offers IT administrators visibility into device performance, health, and security.

Continuous tracking serves as an early warning system that alerts IT of potential issues. Quick troubleshooting means few to no disruptions while optimal device functionality remains intact.

The result? More responsive IT infrastructure that meets dynamic demands.

RDM offers secure and seamless remote access and control. IT administrators can troubleshoot issues, configure settings, and perform maintenance tasks efficiently, no matter where they are.

The responsive nature of remote access and control allows for a more agile IT environment that supports the fluid demands of modern remote work settings.

Automation takes center stage with RDM's ability to update applications on remote devices.

It ensures all devices in your network run the latest software versions and security patches without much human effort, increasing device performance and maintaining constancy, security, and compliance across organizational device networks.

Implementing strong tracking mechanisms is central to zero touch RDM.

With capable trackers, you can efficiently keep tabs on remote devices at all times. By harnessing this technology, you're better equipped to address potential security threats quickly.

Integrating a data leakage protection policy into your RDM solution helps maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity structure.

From configuring firewalls to setting up encryption measures, use your policy to administer security protocol across all remote devices. With automated policy execution, you guarantee uniformity and compliance, lowering risk as much as possible and adapting swiftly to emerging threats.

Generate reports on device performance, usage trends, compliance status, and other metrics to support decision-making and optimization of device management strategies.

RDM lets you lock down devices remotely to protect your organization in the event of a security breach.

This guarantees you prevent unauthorized access while decreasing risks related to prolonged data leakage or breaches.

Sensitive data remains protected, even if devices are lost or stolen, offering organizations a reliable way of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of critical information.

Proactive alerts and notifications introduce a new dimension to the RDM landscape.

Configurable to promptly inform administrators of potential issues, security threats, or deviations from established policies, this feature ensures a proactive response to emerging challenges.

Timely alerts enable IT teams to act swiftly in mitigating risks quickly and protecting remote device environments effectively. Through automated notifications, organizations can stay aware of potential issues early, creating an active approach toward device management.

Organizing remote devices efficiently through robust grouping management features is essential for effective RDM.

Organizations can categorize devices based on specific measures, such as department, location, or user roles. This grouping capability streamlines administrative tasks, allowing for targeted configurations and management based on the unique needs of each device group.

By simplifying workflows and tailoring management to specific criteria, zero touch device grouping management enhances overall efficiency in managing a diverse and distributed device environment.

Navigating the vast landscape of RDM solutions requires a strategic approach.

By carefully considering specific needs, evaluating features, ensuring robust security, testing performance during trials, and weighing cost considerations, organizations can make informed decisions for seamless and effective device management in remote work scenarios.

Begin the selection process by pinpointing your organization's RDM needs and overarching goals. Understanding the unique requirements of your workforce and the tasks they perform lays the foundation for a tailored and useful RDM solution.

Thoroughly assess the functionalities different RDM solutions offer.

Scrutinize capabilities such as remote deployment, monitoring, access control, and automation. See to it that the selected solution aligns with your current needs and has the means to grow with you in the future.

Talk to potential vendors to confirm the inclusion of encryption, authentication mechanisms, and compliance features.

Verify each solution's ability to consistently enforce security policies across all remote devices, safeguard sensitive data, and mitigate potential cyber threats.

Optimize your decision-making by testing the connection and speed performance of RDM solutions during free trials.

Assess real-world scenarios to gauge device responsiveness, latency, and connection stability. This hands-on approach ensures that the platform integrates into your organization's infrastructure without compromising performance.

Match each solution's cost and licensing structure with your organization's budget and growth trajectory.

Consider all associated expenses, including maintenance and support charges, before committing to total ownership cost. Then, you'll be ready to carefully analyze its licensing model for flexibility, scalability, and sustainability before selecting one solution as your favorite option.

Navigating RDM requires comprehensive strategies and policies - including data loss prevention (DLP) policies - for effective execution. The risks underscore the complexity associated with managing devices across dispersed work environments.

Without physical proximity, configuring and deploying devices requires complex solutions to safeguard private data. You have to create a strong DLP so you can deploy devices and protect sensitive information at the same time.

Your plan should help you streamline the procedures associated with managing zero touch technologies remotely.

Troubleshooting technical issues and providing end-user support necessitate innovative approaches for diagnosing and solving issues without direct device access. Implementing a DLP policy keeps customer support on top of data protection guidelines to avoid exposing sensitive information during troubleshooting sessions.

Devices operating outside the traditional corporate network are vulnerable to numerous security risks, from malware infections and unauthorized access to data protection measures enforcing and securely handling sensitive data across remote devices.

A robust data loss prevention policy helps you lower risk by outlining specific data protection measures across remote devices. Encryption, multifactor authentication, and continuous security awareness training are some of the components that contribute to an effective DLP policy.

Unstable connectivity is a persistent challenge in RDM. Inconsistent network connections can impede the efficiency of device management processes, leading to delays and potential disruptions.

Establishing a DLP policy that accounts for intermittent connectivity ensures that sensitive data remains protected even in scenarios where the network connection is unstable, safeguarding against potential data vulnerabilities.

Organizations should prioritize solutions that offer offline capabilities and implement DLP measures that account for potential data exposure during connectivity lapses.

Monitoring devices remotely lacks physical oversight. Insufficient inspection can lead to security breaches or policy violations.

A comprehensive DLP policy integrates monitoring mechanisms to let organizations track and respond to deviations promptly. Implementing advanced analytics and real-time monitoring tools ensures you and your team identify potential threats early.

Adhering to privacy and compliance standards with regard to RDM means you have to navigate regulations while respecting user privacy.

A defined DLP policy helps you strike a balance between the two by outlining guidelines for data handling, storage, and transmission that align with privacy and compliance protocol.

DLP policies build a framework to protect sensitive data, comply with regulations, and mitigate associated risks related to managing devices across an enterprise workforce environment. Organizations that strategically develop DLP policies create safer RDM ecosystems.

Organizations face several challenges when remote managing devices at scale and spread everywhere, ranging from security risks to technical issues and communication barriers. However, with the right solutions in place, these challenges can be effectively addressed.

Utilizing RDM solutions and implementing robust security protocols are key steps in overcoming the obstacles associated with managing devices in a distributed workforce.

As we move towards a more distributed workforce model, organizations must prioritize RDM. By investing in secure solutions, regularly updating policies, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, organizations can ensure the seamless operation of remote devices and enhance productivity in a distributed work environment.",learn.g2.com,news,learn.g2.com,,0.3803921568627451,448740816,1,https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/remote%20device%20management.jpg#keepProtocol,

The report introduces a groundbreaking business model designed for grid-connected hybrid solar power systems, with projections indicating the potential to unlock 3.3GW of solar capacity and attract $6.5 billion in investments.

This study targets 170,000 corporations and industrial manufacturers in Nigeria, offering them substantial cost savings by transitioning from diesel-fired generators to utility-enabled solar systems with backup battery storage.

The study highlights the significant advantages of this new model, not only for C&I customers but also for electricity distribution companies (DisCos). By embracing utility-enabled solar systems, businesses can reduce energy costs, while DisCos stand to benefit from increased revenues through enhanced grid consumption and the connection of new customers to the grid.

""This feasibility study has been in the works for a long time, and we're elated to announce its results. While Nigeria's solar industry is taking off, it's still relatively in its early days, and innovative studies like this are key to deepening the market and adding more value to the business community.

We can provide even more affordable and reliable power to Nigerian businesses if we team up with distribution companies in close partnerships to solve challenges and eliminate uncertainties in the power value chain,"" said Victor Ezenwoko, Daystar Power's country Head of Nigeria and Ghana.

Pilot group results: C&I customers save on average 26% in energy costs, DisCos see up to 1,000% increase in profitability

In 2023, Daystar and RMI conducted Nigeria's first-ever feasibility study to develop custom hybrid solar power systems that integrated with the national grid for 20 C&I customers in Abuja and Lagos, working in partnership with Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), and Ikeja Electric (IE).

The study found that 17 of the 20 customers saved on energy costs, with an average savings of 26%, while the project portfolio totaled 27 MW in new solar capacity and offset an estimated 25,000 metric tons in CO2 emissions. Under the model, DisCos' profitability surged up to 1,000%.

Among the 20 customers, The Wood Factory, an Abuja-based furniture manufacturer, became the first to reach close with an agreement with Daystar and AEDC on January 19, 2024.

""RMI is very proud to have de-risked a pipeline of projects at 20+ C&I customer sites and facilitated the contract signing of the first project of its kind in Nigeria.

The business model exemplifies that unlocking sustainable grids and scaling distributed energy systems can go hand in hand and create win-win-win scenarios for customers, developers, and DisCos.

It's time for radical clean energy implementation, and we hope the project will lead to scaling distributed energy resources (DERs) in Nigeria to help improve reliability and reduce reliance on expensive, polluting fuels,"" said Suleiman Babamanu, RMI, Nigeria Program Director.

The business model is based on a tripartite agreement between the customer, Daystar, and DisCo. Daystar installs and operates a fully-financed hybrid solar system on behalf of Nigerian businesses to provide power supply during daytime peak hours (9 am to 3 pm). Meanwhile, the DisCos will extend hours of grid power to supply electricity to customers in the evening, night, and early morning hours (3 pm to 9 am). Backup batteries and generators mitigate against any grid outages and outperform generator-only backup systems in cost savings and reliability.

Illustration of the proposed utility-enabled C&I business model

A majority of C&I customers face poor reliability from the grid due to blackouts resulting from a collapse in transmission and distribution networks. Given poor grid services, many customers depend on diesel-fired generators as a primary and backup power source and pay energy costs that are three times more expensive than grid tariffs. Over the last two years, diesel prices have surged in Nigeria, rising from 260 Naira per liter in 2021 to more than 800 Naira per liter in Lagos and 850 Naira per liter in Abuja at the time of the study in 2023. Under the tripartite agreement, Daystar will finance upfront grid infrastructure upgrades by deducting DisCo payments (see diagram). With support to solve persistent infrastructure gaps, DisCos have the incentives to prioritize grid supply to C&I customers.

We start with investigating the global invariance (4), which as we demonstrate constitutes a powerful device both if is a global object or if it is locally resolved via dependence on a position. We first consider the seemingly trivial case , for which of course 〈1〉 = 1 due to the correct normalization of Ψ. The right-hand side of Eq. (4) vanishes and we obtain , i.e., the vanishing of the mean external force in equilibrium. This is intuitively expected, as can be seen by contradiction as follows. If the mean external force did not vanish, then the system would start to move on average and hence it would not be in equilibrium.

Adressing the global external force and hence setting in Eq. (4) leads upon simplifying the right-hand side via to the recently formulated global force-variance relationship . Here the auto-correlation of the global external force (left-hand side) equals up to a factor β the mean external potential energy curvature (right-hand side).

By iteratively replacing with the composite in Eq. (4), one can systematically generate higher-order sum rules, starting with , where the first term on the right-hand side allows repeated application of Eq. (4) and the second term can be written via the external potential curvature. The result is the following global second-order hyperforce sum rule:

where . The second term on the right hand of Eq. (13) side can alternatively be written as an integral over a correlation function as follows: , where is the correlation of and the local density operator. Alternatively to the present route via Eq. (4), the sum rule (13) can equivalently be derived from second-order invariance of against global shifting and hence calculating ∂A(ϵ)/∂ϵ∂ϵ = 0.

Addressing locally resolved correlation functions on the basis of Eq. (4) allows to access a higher degree of spatial resolution. We first consider the case , which leads upon re-writing the right-hand side of Eq. (4) via to the following identity:

where we recall that on the right-hand side is the averaged density profile. Hence building the correlation of the density operator with the global external force acts to spatially differentiate the density profile. We recall that the density gradient ∇ρ(r), as it occurs on the right-hand side of Eq. (14), follows alternatively from the YBG equation (1), which upon multiplication by β attains the form ∇ρ(r) = βF(r) + βF(r), where the external force density is simply given as F(r) = - ρ(r) ∇V(r).

It is interesting to note that Eq. (14), when written in covariance form as , mirrors closely the structure of the thermodynamic identity with the local compressibility χ(r). Here rather than the spatial gradient, the thermodynamic parametric derivative with respect to chemical potential occurs. Equation (14) can also be viewed as the so-called inverse Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) relation , as is obtainable from global translational invariance. Having explicit results for the density covariance is however not required in the much more straightforward form (14). Furthermore, by summing only over particle pairs with unequal indices we obtain the distinct identity , which again relates seemingly very different physical objects identically to each other. The derivation is straightforward by starting from Eq. (14), subtracting the self contribution which is the YBG equation (1) in the form - βρ(r) ∇V(r) = - βF(r) + ∇ρ(r), and dividing the result by β.

To validate the Noether invariance theory and to investigate its implications for the use of force sampling methods, we turn to many-body simulations and consider the Lennrd-Jones (LJ) fluid as a representative microscopic model. The LJ pair potential ϕ(r) between two particles separated by a distance r has the familiar form ϕ(r) = 4ϵ[(σ/r) - (σ/r)] with the energy scale ϵ and particle size σ both being constants.

As our above statistical mechanical derivations continue to hold canonically, we sample both via adaptive Brownian dynamics (BD) with a fixed number of particles, but also using Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. Spatial inhomogeneity is induced by confining the system between two planar, parallel LJ walls. Each wall is represented by an external potential contribution V(z) that we choose to be identical to the LJ interparticle potential ϕ(r), but instead of the radial distance r evaluated as a function of the distance z perpendicular to the wall, V(z) = 4ϵ[(σ/z) - (σ/z)]. The joint potential of both walls is then V(z) = V(z) + V(L - z), with L indicating the separation distance between the two walls. The specific choice of 12-6-wall potential is made for convenience only and it differs from the physically motivated 9-3-form (see e.g., Evans et al.).

The system is periodic in the two directions perpendicular to the z-direction across the slit; a sketch is shown in Fig. 1b. The wall separation distance is chosen as L = 10σ, with σ denoting the LJ particle size, and the lateral box length is also set to 10σ. The LJ potential is cut and shifted with a cutoff distance of 2.5σ. The reduced temperature is kT/ϵ = 2 with ϵ denoting the LJ energy scale. We use N = 200 particles. Sampling is started after 10 time steps that are used for equilibration. The subsequent sampling runlength is 3 × 10 time steps which corresponds to ~ 2000τ, where τ = γσ/ϵ denotes the Brownian timescale with γ being the friction constant. All results that we show for correlators are obtained from evaluation as covariances. Subtracting the residual contribution from the product of the two mean values helps to remove artifacts that occur due to finite sampling.

The density profile of the confined LJ fluid, resolved as a function of the scaled position z/σ across the planar slit, is shown in Fig. 2a. The shape of the spatial density variation features structured packing effects that appear adjacent to each wall and that become damped towards the middle of the pore. Turning to the density gradient, we present simulation results for both sides of Eq. (14) in Fig. 2b. Equation (14) in the specific planar geometry reduces to , where δ(z - z) is a one-dimensional Dirac distribution, z is the component of the vector r across the pore, L is the lateral system area, and the global external force has only a nonvanishing z-component given by . The density profile is sampled as ρ(z) = 〈∑ δ(z - z)/L〉. The comparison of the a priori very different data sets shown in Fig. 2b indicates excellent agreement. That the correlation of the density operator with the global external force operator indeed gives the gradient of the density profile, cf. Eq. (14), is surely not only at first glance very counter-intuitive.

We next consider the one-body interparticle force density operator , for which Eq. (4) yields

Equation (15) gives access to the gradient of the internal force density (right-hand side) via sampling the correlation of the local internal force density with the global external force (left-hand side). This relationship could be used in a force sampling scheme, where one obtains data for the force correlations and via spatial integration obtains the interparticle force density, which we demonstrate below. We first present simulation results to illustrate the validity of Eq. (15) in Fig. 2c. The results for carry much less statistical noise, as the need for building the numerical derivative ∇F(r) is avoided. However, this is no panacea, as accurately sampling the correlation of the interparticle force density with the global external force also poses challenges to the overall equilibration of the system.

Addressing the total force density operator requires to complement the above-considered interparticle force density with the ideal and external contributions. These two latter terms constitute mere variants of the density operator identity (14). First there is the external force density operator which yields , as ∇V(r) can be taken out of the phase space average on the left-hand side of Eq. (14). Secondly, the diffusive force density, , leads trivially to the gradient of Eq. (14).

Collecting all three terms (ideal, interparticle, and external) allows us to obtain for the choice a mixed global-local Noether identity:

We present simulation results that validate the sum rule (16) in Fig. 2d. We have checked that via spatial integration these results also validate the global variance identity , which follows from Eq. (13) with operator . For the presently considered system, the global force-force correlation on the left-hand side is only marginally (0.4%) smaller than the global mean potential curvature on the right-hand side.

We turn to the application of the locally resolved hyperforce sum rules (10) and (11). We recall from the Methods section that the seemingly trivial case reduces the local hyperforce identity (11) to the locally resolved force balance relationship . The definition of the total force operator (9) and carrying out the average gives the more explicit form - kT ∇ρ(r) + F(r) - ρ(r) ∇V(r) = 0, i.e., the first member (1) of the Yvon-Born-Green hierarchy. Typically this identity is derived from multiplying the equilibrium probability distribution function Ψ by the gradient of the interaction potential and integrating over the degrees of freedom of N - 1 particles. We emphasize that arguably the simplest possible application of Eq. (11) yields such a central result of liquid state theory with very little effort. From the Noetherian point of view the result was also obtained from applying the locally resolved transformation (5) and (6) to the free energy. At the heart of these Noetherian derivations lies the invariance of the Hamiltonian, of the phase space integration measure, and hence of the partition sum.

We next consider setting in Eq. (10). This constitutes a valuable consistency check with the above global shifting of that led to Eq. (16) and which we can identically reproduce here. Arguably even more fundamentally the sum rule (16) can be obtained by considering mixed local-global shifting invariance at second order, i.e., building the mixed derivative ∂(δΩ/δϵ(r))/∂ϵ = 0, where the grand potential is subject to the combined displacement r → r + ϵ + ϵ(r). Furthermore increasing the spatial resolution and hence selecting in Eq. (10) yields the recent Noether-constrained two-body force-correlation theory, which is discussed in detail by Sammüller et al.. The theory that is presented therein can hence be viewed as the special case of pure force-dependence within the hyperforce framework.

Reverting back to developing the general theory, here we generalize to higher orders by iteratively replacing by in Eq. (8). This leads to the following second-order hyperforce sum rule:

where evaluation of the right-hand side at ϵ(r) = 0 is suppressed in the notation and is discussed by Sammüller et al.. In case of no dependence of on momenta, i.e., , the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (17) can be made more explicit as

We proceed beyond forces by turning to energies with the aim of exploiting their thermal Noether invariance against shifting. We consider both the global external potential energy as well as the global interparticle energy . Applying Eq. (11) yields in these two cases respectively the following sum rules:

Simulation results that demonstrate the validity of Eqs. (19) and (20) are shown in Fig. 3a, b, respectively. Here we have increased the overall density by reducing the lateral box size to 5σ and we sample N = 128 particles over time periods of 2000τ (data shown in Fig. 3a, b) and of 8000τ (data shown in Fig. 3c).

The potential energy identities (19) and (20) can be supplemented by considering the kinetic energy, , which leads upon using Eq. (10) to the identity . Treating then the entire Hamiltonian, , follows from adding up all three energy contributions. The result is the compact identity: . This possibly unexpected behavior also holds for the global entropy. We choose the entropy operator and obtain from Eq. (10) , i.e., the correlation (as well as the covariance) of the entropy operator with the local force density vanishes. This behavior is very different from the nontrivial fluctuation profile that is obtained from the covariance of the density operator with the global entropy.

As a final case, we consider the center of mass ∑r/N as a purely mechanical entity. We multiply by N, such that and obtain from Eq. (11) upon multiplication by - 1 the result

Integrating Eq. (21) over position yields a simple relationship between the correlator of the global external force and the center of mass: , where the mean number of particles is . Except for an additional sum over all particles, this global relationship is akin to the equipartition theorem. We present simulation results for both sides of the locally resolved Eq. (21) in Fig. 3c. The accurate agreement of the respective profiles confirms that the identity (21) indeed offers a rather unusual route to gain access to the density profile.

Besides the unexpected insights into the general correlation structure of equilibrium many-body systems that the thermal Noether invariance delivers, our results are useful for the careful assessment and construction of computer sampling schemes. Force sampling in perhaps its most intuitive form rests on spatial integration of the YBG equation (1) such that the density profile is obtained via ρ(r) = ρ + β∇ ⋅ [F(r) - ρ(r) ∇V(r)], where ρ = const is an integration constant and ∇ is an inverse ∇ operator. The data input on the right-hand side is obtained via sampling and either or F(r) = - 〈∑ δ(r - r)∇V(r)〉. The averages denote those that are being carried out in the simulation. In the present planar geometry ∇ reduces to carrying out a simple position integral, which we make explicit below.

Summarizing, we can compare the results from four different routes: i) counting of particle occurrences in a position-resolved histogram, which constitutes the standard method, ii) force sampling according to Eq. (1), iii) hyperforce sampling according to the global external force correlation in Eq. (14) with spatial integration post-processing, and iv) center-of-mass-based hyperforce sampling according to Eq. (21). These routes are respectively given by the following explicit expressions:

Here we choose the integration constant as ρ = ρ(0) = 0 due to the divergent wall potential at z = 0. The averages on the above right-hand sides denote the actual simulation data, all vectors have been projected onto the z-direction across the pore, and z denotes the z-component of the particle position r. In more detail, the operators on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (22) and (23) are explicitly given as and , where we recall that L is the lateral system size and the z-component of the interparticle force on particle i is . Furthermore the operators on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (24) and (25) are , and .

Results for the density profile from the four routes (22)-(25) are shown in Fig. 4. The simulation parameters are identical as before [Fig. 2]. We display the four different statistical estimators for the density profile, as obtained after increasing runlength of (a) 10, (b) 10, (c) 10, and (d) 3 × 10 simulation steps. We recall that as demonstrated above both in the numerical examples as well as in the formal statistical mechanical derivations, the results from all routes are formally identical. In practice, pronounced differences can be observed and these are due to the simulation averages being mere approximations for the true statistical mechanical equilibrium.

For example the routes (23) and (24) yield less statistical noise due to the spatial integration, but they however can instead accumulate systematic deviations. The expected differences between the four methods are also consistently demonstrated by the fact that the results from the different routes mutually agree better for increasing runlengths. Nevertheless, in particular, the routes (24) and (25) that involve global quantities are very sensitive to the choice of runlength and they can hence serve as indicators of the overall quality of the sampling routine, even when quantities beyond the density profile are the very aim of the simulation. Having such tools for quality control can be particularly useful when investigating capillary and wetting phenomena where surface phase transitions pose significant challenges for reliable prediction.

The Noetherian hyperforce framework allows us to easily go beyond the density profile and we wish to address the interparticle force density as a target, rather than the mere source that it played in contributing to Eq. (23) above for the force sampling. As a demonstration we use and contrast different estimators for the interparticle force density profile F(r). The traditional counting method of filling a position-resolved histogram forms the baseline and Eq. (15) provides an alternative. These methods are respectively given by

Figure 5 presents both canonical averages obtained via adaptive BD as well as grand canonical Monte Carlo data. The chemical potential is chosen as μ/ϵ = 1 and the resulting average number of particles is 〈N〉 = 136.5. In the corresponding adaptive BD simulation runs we have set N = 136, which remains sharply fixed in the course of time. The agreement between both sets of results confirms the expectation of independence of the sum rule validity on the choice of ensemble. This is based on the fact that the theoretical derivations continue to hold with fixed N, as we have also explicitly verified. Hence the mechanical effects that the Noether invariance against spatial displacement captures are oblivious to the presence of global particle number fluctuations. We recall that the latter are precisely captured and quantified by the local compressibility.

The comparison of lower and higher quality statistical data, as obtained from sampling every step (see Fig. 5a, b) or only every 1000th step (see Fig. 5c, d) demonstrates that the force correlation method is a sensitive measure of the degree of sampling quality.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.05098039215686279,448739827,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42005-024-01568-y/MediaObjects/42005_2024_1568_Fig1_HTML.png,

FERC has affirmed its July 2023 rule, Order No. 2023, that aimed to address the country's interconnection backlog. The rule requires all public utilities to adopt revised pro forma generator interconnection procedures and agreements to ensure that interconnection customers can interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent, and timely manner.

FERC's affirmation was meant to address rehearing and clarification requests stemming from Order 2023, and to create a set of compliance orders associated with it.

The rehearing order addressed the respective roles and responsibilities of transmission providers and interconnection customers in the interconnection process. It also aimed to clarify topics ranging from public interconnection information and the cluster study process to withdrawal and study delay penalties, and the consideration of alternative transmission technologies. Additionally, it extended the deadline for transmission providers to submit their compliance filings until 30 days after publication of Order No. 2023-A in the Federal Register.

""Today the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) upheld penalties for utilities and transmission owners that fail to process interconnection applications in a timely manner,"" said Melissa Alfano, senior director of energy markets and counsel for the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""For the last decade, utilities have slow-walked interconnection applications and failed to make progress on their own, causing a massive, two-terawatt backlog of solar and storage assets waiting for permission to connect to the grid. These new rules will establish clear expectations for all parties involved in the interconnection process and outline consequences for inaction.""

FERC also acted on Order No. 2023 compliance filings by Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Carolinas, and Duke Energy Progress; Arizona Public Service Company; and Idaho Power Company. The Commission found that these filings partially comply with Order No. 2023 but directed each entity to submit a further compliance filing.

A US-led effort to help Central Asian states reshape the region's business landscape is achieving some of its initial objectives, putting the initiative on a more solid foundation for potential success. Key Central Asian governments are reacting favorably to the plan.

Heading into the inaugural meeting of what is called the B5+1 process, a primary aim was to institutionalize an annual gathering bringing together private and public sector leaders from all five Central Asian states for discussions aimed at breaking down trade barriers that hinder outside investment and promoting a regional market. That goal has been achieved. Regional governmental interest in developing the B5+1 appears strong: Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are already reportedly jockeying to host the forum next year.

In addition, the Kazakh government appears supportive of the initiative. In closing remarks made at the initial B5+1 forum, held in Almaty from March 13-15, Kazakh First Deputy Minister of National Economy Timur Zhaksylykov expressed the government's readiness to explore ways with the private sector to improve trade prospects in such sectors as agribusiness and e-commerce, as well as work toward developing a unified regional market.

The US State Department quickly issued a statement on March 15 lauding the meeting's accomplishments. ""With support from the U.S. Department of State, the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) will continue to lead B5+1 activities in pursuit of sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Central Asia,"" the statement concluded.

The United States designed the B5+1 concept as an extension of a political dialogue between Washington and the five Central Asian states - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The B in the B5 stands for business. The US role is that of facilitator: the concept rests on the expectation that Central Asian states will take ownership of efforts to integrate the region's economy via strong public-private partnerships. Private sector actors are likewise expected to shape the process.

At the Almaty forum, private sector participants issued a communique expressing an intent to coordinate work that ""improves trade, transit, and investment facilitation,"" while also striving to ""harmonize regulations in key industries"" beyond the energy and extractive sectors, which have received the overwhelming majority of all Western investment coming into the region to date. The B5+1 is prioritizing five economic sectors for development: trade and logistics, agribusiness, e-commerce, tourism and renewable energy.

The communique stated that a near-term priority is the creation of a region-wide chamber of commerce to develop and advocate for economic integration. ""By coming together and exchanging ideas, leading voices of the business community can help promote collective efforts towards dynamic economic growth and mutual prosperity,"" the statement read.

Another priority for the B5+1 is the establishment of a regional arbitration mechanism, effectively a one-stop shop to resolve commercial disputes. ""Reliable protection mechanisms will make the region more competitive in attracting investors internationally,"" according to the communique. Acknowledging that some Central Asia states may be willing or able to move faster in establishing an arbitration system than others, the communique tacitly endorsed a two-tiered system, in which some lead, and others follow. If two or more Central Asian states can quickly demonstrate the effectiveness of a dispute-resolution system, it would send a ""positive signal"" to hesitant governments and give impetus to region-wide expansion, the communique read.

Working groups covering the five priority economic sectors outlined specific next steps in the communique. A common need identified across all five sectors is the development of transnational mechanisms to harmonize regulatory and customs frameworks.

Some targeted recommendations to promote transnational trade included the development of a common digital CMR, or contractual documentation in an electronic format enabling truck-borne goods to move across borders smoothly. Many customs procedures at present are not yet digitized. Another recommendation calls for the abolishment of visa requirements for truck drivers involved in import-export activities. To promote tourism, meanwhile, the B5+1 wants governments to adopt a Schengen-like tourism visa that enables sightseers to move freely within the five regional states.

Although the B5+1 is off to an encouraging start, lots of challenges still stand in the way of success. In a region where authoritarian methods tend to shape governmental policy, it remains uncertain how much of the initiative officials are willing to cede to private sector actors. Meanwhile, private sector capabilities in such areas as policy development and advocacy are largely untested. Previous efforts to promote a greater degree of regional economic integration have fallen flat, and efforts to promote a single Central Asian market run counter to the interests of Russia and China.

If the B5+1 maintains its forward momentum, the outcome is envisioned as a well-regulated, efficient single market that opens the floodgates for Western investment. Integration under the B5+1 vision can also ensure the individual sovereignty of each Central Asian state, helping them withstand political and economic pressure exerted by neighboring states and other outside actors.

""Governments and businesses should unite efforts to position Central Asia as an attractive [investment] destination, rather than merely a transit zone in global value chains,"" the B5+1 communique reads.

Advocates of the US-led process admit that Washington is hoping to increase its influence in Central Asia with the B5+1 process, but they draw a sharp distinction between this new American approach and Russia's and China's. The B5+1's strategy aims to grow American influence in the region organically in ways that are diametrically opposite to the methods used by Moscow and Beijing.

""All FDI [foreign direct investment] is not created equal,"" Eric Hontz, who heads CIPE's Center for Accountable Investment, said during the Almaty forum. He noted that FDI can have a positive-sum effect, in which both parties in any agreement reap benefits, or zero-sum, in which any given deal has a clear winner and loser. A zero-sum approach, when employed as an FDI strategy, often aims to achieve the ""stagnation and capture"" by the investor of an entire sector of another state's economy.",oilprice.com,news,OilPrice.com,,0.4509803921568627,448736535,1,https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-03-21_huxp2al7o1.jpg,

Such an endeavor will focus on sands due to their inherently complex fabric. This work resorts to experiments performed under laterally restrained conditions to simulate the mechanics of sands at sites, aiming to replicate in-situ boundary conditions and minimize inconsistencies due to boundary effects, as discussed in previous studies for spherical beads1,4. The adopted sign convention in this work is the typical one of geomechanics and considers compressive stresses, contractive strains, and settlements as positive.

This section starts analyzing the impacts of thermal cycles on the mechanics of granular materials with reference to the influence of relative density and particle shape. As in the remainder of this work, such an endeavor resorts to two types of tests: (1) isothermal tests involving mechanical loading up to a vertical stress of MPa, followed by unloading at constant ambient temperature; and (2) non-isothermal tests involving an equivalent path of mechanical loading and unloading, with the additional application of 50 thermal cycles with a temperature amplitude of °C under a constant stress of kPa. Loose and dense sands with rounded, subangular, and angular particle shapes are considered. See ""Methods"" for details.

Figure 1 shows the impacts of 50 thermal cycles on the volumetric strain and porosity of granular materials with variable relative densities and particle shapes. The results show that granular materials expand upon heating and contract upon cooling, undergoing a hysterical mechanical response due to thermal cycling (Fig. 1a). The slopes of the thermally induced strains upon heating are consistent with those predicted by the theory of thermo-elasticity. However, the slopes of the thermally induced strains upon cooling significantly deviate from the one predicted by the theory of thermo-elasticity, especially when considering the first cycles. Therefore, irreversible contractive deformations originate upon the completion of individual heating-cooling cycles, accumulating cycle after cycle (Fig. 1b). Notably, the slopes characterizing the thermally induced strains upon successive heating and cooling cycles tend to converge to the slope predicted by the theory of thermo-elasticity as the number of cycles increases, resulting in smaller irreversible deformations. This stabilization of volumetric strain also implies a concurrent stabilization of shear strain. This behavior aligns with the definition of plastic shakedown and, since it is caused by temperature variations, it is termed as thermally induced plastic shakedown, or simply thermal shakedown.

In agreement with previous evidence referring to sands subjected to one heating-cooling cycle, the magnitude of contractive deformations affecting granular materials subjected to individual heating-cooling cycles is relatively limited. However, multiple thermal cycles result in significant bulk irreversible volumetric contractions of granular materials. Such deformations reach a cumulative value of about 0.9% after only 50 thermal cycles with an amplitude of 60 °C. Notably, deformations of about 1% are significant and can lead to problematic consequences for the operational performance of geotechnologies, such as geotechnical structures, geothermal systems, and underground thermal energy storage systems. These deformations are also expected to contribute to changes in the morphology of landforms, not only in natural environments but also in built environments increasingly affected by temperature variations in the underground.

The evolution of the porosity change of granular materials subjected to thermal cycling can be fitted with an empirical relationship (see Eq. (4) in ""Methods"") previously proposed for describing the response of sands subjected to cyclic mechanical loads (Fig. 1c). The relatively consistent value of the exponent of such formulation across different tests suggests a universal underlying physics governing the phenomenon. In alignment with the available observations for sands undergoing cyclic mechanical loads, the considered empirical evolution law suggests the achievement of a ""terminal density"" in sands and other granular materials undergoing thermal shakedown (i.e., for a very large number of thermal cycles that cannot be achieved via laboratory experiments due to their daunting duration). Accordingly, it is postulated that the application of cyclic temperature variations to granular materials characterized by different initial porosities does not cause structural reorganizations that converge into a universal value of porosity when the number of thermal cycles tends to infinity, as this phenomenon does not characterize granular materials subjected to many cycles of mechanical loading and unloading .

The results unveil that deformations caused by thermal cycling markedly depend on the relative density of granular materials, even if the porosities of such materials differ dramatically at a given relative density. The porosity changes produced by 50 thermal cycles particularly indicate that irreversible deformations depend on the initial relative density, rather than the initial porosity (Fig. 1d). Dense sands exhibit smaller irreversible deformations than loose sands. This phenomenon results from the smaller potential for microstructural reorganizations that characterizes denser compared to looser granular materials.

The results further uncover that deformations caused by thermal cycling are strongly influenced by particle shape, with more significant deformations characterizing granular materials with increasingly rounded particles. Granular materials with rounded particles arguably undergo larger deformations compared to materials with angular particles due to the larger translational and rotational freedom of rounded particles compared to angular particles upon thermal cycling. Such a greater freedom is supported by the magnitude of plastic strains and porosity changes induced by thermal shakedown for each relative density. Exceptions apply to the first few thermal cycles, where granular materials with rounded particles show smaller plastic strains compared to the materials with subangular and angular particles, in agreement with previous results addressing the impacts of one heating-cooling cycle on the same materials. In these circumstances, the larger initial porosity characteristic of sands with angular and subangular particles compared to sands with rounded particles is considered to overcome the inhibited freedom caused by particle angularity due to an initially higher potential for structural reorganizations.

Figure 2 shows the mechanical response of granular materials with irregular particle shapes before, during, and after thermal cycling by comparing the compression curves associated with the non-isothermal and isothermal tests. Both the isothermal and non-isothermal tests indicate that granular materials characterized by smaller relative densities exhibit larger deformations under the same applied mechanical load (Fig. 2a,c) or thermal load (Fig. 2b,d). Thermal cycling causes a progressive increase in contractive deformations under constant applied vertical stress (Fig. 2b,d). 50 thermal cycles of °C cause contractive strains whose magnitudes can vary from about half to a similar value of strains caused by the application of a vertical stress of MPa. This evidence characterizes sands under both loose conditions (Fig. 2a,b) and dense conditions (Fig. 2c,d).

The obtained results allow to discover a peculiar role of particle shape on the deformation of granular materials, depending on whether mechanical or thermal loading is considered. Deformations caused by mechanical loading increase with the particle angularity (Fig. 2a,c). In other words, granular materials with angular particles deform more than materials with rounded particles under the same applied mechanical load, exhibiting a larger compressibility. In contrast, deformations caused by thermal loads decrease with the particle angularity (Fig. 2b,d). In other words, granular materials with angular particles deform less than materials with rounded particles upon thermal cycles of the same amplitude.

Therefore, particle shape involves complex effects on the mechanics of granular materials. An increasing particle angularity can lead to: (a) a higher porosity, (b) fewer but sharper contacts, and (c) particle interlocking due to concave surfaces. These aspects can lead to opposite consequences. Upon mechanical loading, effects (a) and (b) appear to govern the response of granular materials through a larger potential for plastic strains, as voids can be reduced when significant particle rearrangements occur. These effects may also justify the exceptions associated with the first few thermal cycles. Upon thermal loading, effects (b) and (c) appear to govern the response of granular materials, with a progressively hampered influence of effect (a) during successive thermal cycles. Rough and concave surfaces generate larger friction and rolling resistances between particles, which hamper their relative sliding and rolling. Therefore, after the first thermal cycles, increasingly restrained particle rearrangements characterize angular sands, resulting in smaller consequent deformations for multiple thermal cycles when compared to rounded sands.

This section further explores the impacts of thermal cycles on the mechanics of granular materials with reference to the influence of the stress level. This analysis resorts to the results of (1) isothermal tests and (2) non-isothermal tests involving the application of 50 thermal cycles with an identical amplitude of °C at variable stress levels of , , and kPa. Results refer to the rounded sand. See ""Methods"" for details.

Figure 3 shows the impacts of 50 thermal cycles applied at different stress levels on the volumetric strain of granular materials at two relative densities. The results consistently indicate a clear trend: a larger applied stress prior to thermal cycling leads to smaller thermally induced irreversible strains (Fig. 3a,b). Specifically, a non-linear, inverse relationship between the magnitude of the applied stress level and the irreversible strains caused by thermal cycling is observed. Consequently, a variable applied stress level involves a considerable difference in the magnitude of contractive volumetric strains caused by thermal cycling relative to those caused by mechanical loading (Fig. 3c,d).

The hampered magnitude of thermal shakedown at elevated levels of applied stress before thermal cycling is ascribed to the heightened structural stability observed in granular materials under higher stress conditions. This enhanced stability arguably arises from the strengthened force chains and larger restraint within the materials, which occur for increasing mechanical loads and material relative densities, respectively. The underlying rationale is that more heavily loaded and denser granular structures require more substantial perturbations to yield microstructural changes associated with thermal shakedown.

This section concludes the analysis of the impacts of thermal cycles on the mechanics of granular materials with reference to the influence of the temperature amplitude. This analysis resorts to the results of (1) isothermal tests and (2) non-isothermal tests involving the application of 50 thermal cycles with variable amplitudes of , , and °C at an identical stress level of kPa. Results refer to the rounded sand. See ""Methods"" for details.

Figure 4 shows the impacts of 50 thermal cycles with different amplitudes on the volumetric strain of granular materials at two relative densities. The results consistently indicate another clear trend: thermal cycles with a larger temperature amplitude generate more significant thermally induced irreversible strains (Fig. 4a,b). Specifically, a non-linear relationship between temperature amplitude and irreversible strains is observed. As a result, doubling the amplitude of temperature variations from to °C results in more than proportional thermally induced strains. Under both loose and dense conditions, granular materials subjected to thermal cycles with an amplitude of °C show a more pronounced hysterical response (Fig. 4a) and larger plastic strains (Fig. 4b) compared to thermal cycles with an amplitude of and 30 °C. This result is consistent with previous evidence obtained for glass spheres and originates from more significant thermally induced particle deformations and interconnected variations in interparticle forces. A variable temperature amplitude involves a significant change in the magnitude of contractive volumetric strains caused by thermal cycling relative to mechanical loading (Fig. 4c,d). This result highlights, once again, the considerable influence of thermal loading compared to mechanical loading.",nature.com,news,Nature,,-0.1686274509803921,448736303,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-57503-2/MediaObjects/41598_2024_57503_Fig1_HTML.png,

The key findings are that the DB and hybrid landscape continues to shrink at a consistent rate and scheme funding levels have improved since 2022. However, updated methodology means that data in this publication cannot be meaningfully compared with previous years.

According to the report, the total number of DB and hybrid schemes has reduced by two per cent from 5,378 in 2022 to 5,297. For schemes within the landscape, the percentage closed to future accrual (excluding those in wind-up) has risen from 70 per cent to 72 per cent. In addition, the number of schemes with 100 per cent or greater technical provisions funding levels increased from 2,565 to 3,620 and the total deficit (of schemes in deficit) reduced from £63.610bn to £27.673bn.

Take a ride on the IndyCar $1 Million Challenge track in Thermal","Thermal Club Track Operations Manager Nick Rhoades takes The Desert Sun for a few sideways laps around one of their course layouts in a BMW M3.

I'm not much of a thrill-seeker. Don't love roller-coasters. Sky diving? No, thanks. Bungee jumping? Hard pass.

I consider myself an avid indoorsman but with the first-of-its-kind IndyCar $1 Million Challenge coming to Thermal this weekend, I was offered a chance to be driven around the race track by an expert to learn a little about the straightaways and corners and turns and banking of the track and get a feel for what the racers will be seeing and thinking.

""Whoa! Cool. I'd love to do that,"" I lied, already imagining how petrified I'd be in the passenger's seat, while some 23-year-old Italian professional racer, zips me around the track as I try not to embarrass myself. But after some minor goading, I figured it would be a life moment not to pass up, and at the very least it will count as one of my semi-yearly, let's-have-Shad-do-something-that-terrifies-him-and-laugh-at-his-experience columns.

So I showed up at the Thermal Club about 40 miles east of Palm Springs, an impressive mini-city that is a speed freak's Disneyland. A private club with multiple race tracks and all the amenities for car drivers, owners and enthusiasts. If you love the smell of burnt rubber in the morning, this is the place for you.

I'm not a ""car guy"" so it was a bit intimidating, like being in a foreign land. I arrived already nervous, like getting to school the day of your big speech, and grew more nervous seeing all the infrastructure and cars and mechanics and hearing the impressive vrooms from different corners of the club.

After chatting with some of the dignitaries who were kind enough to set us up with this opportunity, we moved to the side of the track that the real IndyCar racers are going to drive on this weekend. Other men and women were already zipping around and pulling into the pits, and tinkering with their cars, and zooming back out on the track.

The team was getting a car, specifically a BMW M3 Competition, ready for me and Desert Sun photographer Andy Abeyta to take a ride in.

As I milled around trying to make small talk, carburetors and such, we learned who was going to be doing the driving and it was exactly like my vision. Out of nowhere, Mateo showed up. He was in his 20s and he was from Italy. He was dressed in the full auto-racing jumpsuit, straight out of central casting. Uh oh. Not only am I scared, I'm going to be scared in front of a cool guy like Mateo.

Seconds later someone trackside said, ""you guys are green.""

I thought they were referring to the color of my skin in the gills area. ""Is it that obvious I'm queasy,"" I thought.

Fast and Furious? More like Fast and Nauseous. Days of Thunder? More like Days of Chunder. Ford vs. Ferrari? More like Shad vs. ... well I don't know how to finish that one, but there was no time anyway, they were fitting me for a helmet from a trackside helmet shelf. That's the type of place we're talking about, it has a big outdoor shelf just for racecar drivers' helmets.

I soon learned being ""green"" at a racetrack, actually means you're up. You're turn to go, as in green light. That makes more sense.

They found a helmet that fit me, and I squeezed it on over my head. Now I will say, something about putting on a racecar driver's helmet. It instantly gives you some weird confidence. Aside from the safety, you just simply feel about two notches cooler than you were before putting it on. It's weird, but I almost started to feel like ""You got this, Shad."" And then more good news.

As we approached the car, it was decided that instead of Mateo, it would be Thermal Club track manager Nick Rhoades that would be driving us instead. That way he could answer questions along the way. Whew. This gave me more a sense of ease since Rhoades was a mild-mannered man closer to my age. He was dressed more like a guy working at a golf pro shop, than an automotive daredevil.

It was time.

Andy had equipped the car with a bunch of cameras and go-pros (oh good, this is being filmed) and he got in the backseat. Wearing a polo shirt and my racing jeans, I got in the passenger seat. Being 6-foot-7 I was worried I might not fit in this BMW built for speed, but there was a surprising amount of leg room and just enough head room when you factor in the helmet. Our seatbelts clicked, we could talk to each other through our helmet microphones, and Rhoades was about to take us around the track a few times.

We'll probably ease into it, going a little faster each time around, is what I was thinking right up until the second Rhoades' foot hit the gas pedal. Instantly we were going faster than I ever have in a car before. The back of my head was one with the headrest and I quickly reached up and grabbed what can only be described as the scaredy-cat's handle as though my life depended on it.

Rhoades wasn't easing us into anything. Uh oh. Classic don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover mistake. It only took one straightaway, one turn, one hairpin turn complete with a Tokyo drift-style skid to have me internally wishing good old Mateo was behind the wheel instead.

Rhoades was giving us a very real experience out on the track and as I gathered myself enough to take a sideways glance at him, I could tell he was enjoying this. Both being behind the wheel and my clear and obvious terror. I soon realized that our first skid wasn't an accident but it was intentional in that that's how you have to attack every curve on the race track. Rhoades wasn't losing control when we drifted, he was always in total control.

Slowly it became clear that Rhoades was completely at home in this car, and that made my fear level go down. The way he masterfully and instinctively manipulated the brakes to get us into and out of the appropriate skids keeping us on the fastest line for the track was amazing. This was nothing to him. He operated this speeding car with the same innate ease that I operate my TV's remote control. Because of this, I started to feel safe.

With each lap, my stomach started to head back down from my throat toward its traditional home in the belly area.

I was struck by the jostling and the physical toll it takes on your body to be in a racecar. Each tap of the brake pedal, each turn, each drift requires some sort of physical bracing of the body that adds up over time. And I was only in Rhoades' torture chamber for just under five minutes. That gave me renewed respect for drivers in these hours-long races.

During this whole ride, Rhoades was calmly explaining what the drivers would be thinking and why the track was designed the way it was to offer specific challenges. He used the word ""chicane"" casually, which I later looked up and now know means a narrowing or turn intentionally created in a race track.

I finally gathered myself enough to talk. I asked Rhoades a few dry-mouthed questions while we were zipping around the track. How does he know how to control the skid with the extra weight of Andy and I in the car?

He said it was actually easier with more weight in the car and that for him it's all just feel at this point, from years in the business and what he called with a laugh ""some misspent youth.""

Andy said later that judging by my silence and the look on my face he was worried I was about to or may have already passed out, and that when I asked my first question, he was relieved. That's fair.

We did about eight to 10 laps, going a little faster each time. As we kept going into the skids, I eventually had a surprising reaction, laughter. It started as nervous laughter but grew impressed laughter when you're watching a magician do a particularly amazing trick, or a chess master demolishing an opponent. The laughter that says ""it's hilarious how good this person is at what I'm watching them do right now.""

We were literally and figuratively along for the ride in Rhoades' world and, wait a minute, am I having fun? As my head careened into the interior side wall of the BMW for the 15th time I thought, ""Hold up. I'm not hating this. I'm enjoying this. Is that possible?"" I'm not praying for it to end, I'm wanting it to continue. Whoa. Plot twist.

As fate would have it, soon after I came to this realization, our ride was over. It was one of the scariest and best five minutes I've had in a long time.

I peeled myself out of the car and thanked Rhoades. I was actually happy to be back on solid ground as it turns out. That's where I belong, but I had to admit the feel of zipping around the track -- apparently we topped out at around 130 miles per hour -- was exhilarating and maybe even a little life-changing.

We took some photos posing around the car, even a couple with me in the driver's seat making it look like I belonged out there as sort of a lanky extremely poor man's Tom Cruise. My time as a racecar passenger had ended, and I was happy it happened. Thanks to Thermal Club owner Tim Rogers and member Don Cusick for making it a reality.

As I put my helmet back on the helmet shelf, Mateo walked by.

""You let Nick take you out? That's brave,"" he said.

The Solana USDC integration push comes with the launch of Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) only a few days away. This development is likely to be a game changer for the Solana ecosystem in the long run. The scheduled date for the CCTP launch on the Solana mainnet is March 26, and Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire touted the coming event on X when he noted that a big launch is coming.

USDC issuer Circle is preparing for the launch by putting structures into place to facilitate the smooth implementation. Consequently, the firm declared that it has enhanced developers' capacity to build out integration on the Solana devnet by updating the necessary information.

Noteworthy, CCTP was initially introduced by Circle as its proprietary stablecoin transfer protocol. The CCTP was launched on Arbitrum last year weeks after the launching of USDC on the same network. This makes Solana the second non-AVM chain to welcome the CCTP function. These launches are aimed at facilitating the easy movement of the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling network.

Precisely, CCTP runs as an on-chain utility protocol that improves USDC transfer between different blockchains. It leverages native burning and minting to complete its activities.

Above all, the CCTP brings a lot of benefits to give it a competitive edge amongst which is capital efficiency and a reduction in trust needs during USDC transfer between blockchain networks. Developers can now utilize the CCTP to build innovative cross-chain apps that cut across the capabilities of trading, loans, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), payments, and even gambling.

The implementation of the CCTP and the Solana USDC integration is bound to impact the utilization and adoption of SOL.

In terms of price, the crypto has been performing well and it even outperformed Ethereum (ETH) recently when it breached the $200 resistance. At press time, SOL was trading at a price of $186.35 with a 6.75% increase within the last 24 hours.

To showcase its bullish outlook, some analysts still believe that the crypto would bag up to a 70% gain in the coming weeks. The Solana USDC integration and CCTP launch may just be the key driver that the token needs for such a mega boost.

It explores how such securitization, particularly in the context of language assessments, can contribute to exclusionary practices and reinforce societal inequalities. Specifically, language borders often neglect important socio-linguistic features such as language variation, change, and the dynamic nature of linguistic belonging.

The policy paper identifies the following policy recommendations:

In conclusion, this policy paper advocates for a transformative approach to language assessment, aiming to move away from securitization objectives and to weaken rigid language borders. This shift towards a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of linguistic repertoires is seen as essential for promoting linguistic justice and equity in diverse societies.

Linguistic diversity is inherent to human societies and multilingualism can be defined as the norm in most societal contexts, yet the concept of monolingual nation-states is still a persisting bias with very tangible consequences in terms of political discourses and actual implemented policies. Specifically, when minority languages are perceived as threatening this homogeneous ideal, disputes over linguistic rights can raise questions on national identity, ethnic belonging, and social cohesion. Eventually, language may become a politicized vehicle for conveying broader exclusionary sentiments tied to linguicism (Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1996) and group discrimination. Indeed, the securitization of language is historically linked to the nation-state's development in the Western world, since language has been a principal basis for nation-building, leading to linguistic standardization and homogenization. In this context linguistic minorities are often perceived as problematic, challenging the monolingual norm and hierarchy of languages within society (Marko & Medda-Windischer 2018), especially in the presence of arising structural phenomena such as changes in demographic balance among linguistic groups and/or alterations in the socio-economic conditions affecting the social status and prestige of the language (Carlà 2007). Linguistic disputes within this securitizing frame are viewed as zero-sum games, with any perceived threat to the 'purity' of language considered a danger to the survival of linguistic groups (Medda-Windischer & Carlà 2022).

This policy paper aims to underscore the divergence between, on one hand, monolingual perspectives regarding language, language use, and language affiliation, and on the other hand, the actual plurilingual practices and dynamic identities evident in the real world, and how such divergence (un)consciously contributes to processes of language securitization through language bordering. The analysis focuses specifically on issues revolving around language proficiency and language variation/standardization, highlighting how they are often approached in securitization terms in the design and implementation of language policies, especially when dealing with linguistic diversity stemming from migratory phenomena. It seeks to identify strategies for overcoming rigid approaches within language policies and advocating for linguistic justice in societies experiencing growing linguistic super-diversity.

Concepts: institutional approaches vs real-world manifestations

In the EU framework, 'multilingualism' has been defined as encompassing both ""the ability of societies, institutions, groups, and individuals to engage, on a regular basis, with more than one language in their day-to-day lives"" and ""the co-existence of different language communities in one geographical or geo-political area or political entity"" (European Commission 2007: 6). In contrast, the Council of Europe (2007: 8) distinguishes 'plurilingualism' as ""the repertoire of varieties of language which many individuals use"" and defines 'multilingualism' as ""the presence in a geographical area, large or small, of more than one variety of language, i.e., the mode of speaking of a social group whether it is formally recognized as a language or not."" The introduction of the term 'plurilingualism' seeks to underscore that ""learning languages throughout life for various purposes and with different degrees of proficiency is an educational process involving conscious, holistic planning, and specific monitoring"" (Council of Europe 2007: 31). In this context, 'plurilingualism' is proposed to replace a series of overlapping definitions of the same holistic approach to the knowledge and use of multiple languages, including active, dynamic, integrated multilingualism, and translanguaging (Piccardo 2019). Central to this vision is the concept of a linguistic repertoire, ""understood as the set of resources available for a person to act socially, through production and interpretation of meanings, [including] linguistic varieties, dialects, discursive genres, and common speech acts in a given community [...] as well as multimodal forms of expression (gestures, movement, facial expressions, etc.) that are discursively and culturally embodied in and among social groups"" (Vallejo & Dooly 2020: 5). Consequently, plurilingualism extends beyond individuals with proficiency in different languages to include those who consider themselves monolinguals, acknowledging that every language is a composite of ""different varieties, sociolects, and borrowings and is intrinsically dynamic in its constant change"" (Piccardo 2019: 190).

However, the institutional understanding of multilingualism often deviates from its real-world manifestation, resulting in a gap between official standards and fluid, culturally hybrid forms of language use in informal settings (Pujolar 2007). This dichotomy reflects an established division between transparent or discrete language ideologies and a hybrid language ideology (see De Schutter 2007). Discreteness embraces well-defined linguistic structures and identities, characterized by monolingualism and distinct linguistic boundaries. In contrast, hybridity acknowledges the prevalence of bi- and multilingualism in our linguistic world, advocating for vague boundaries and linguistic pluralism. The normative conclusion drawn from this perspective leans toward language policies that respect hybrid linguistic identities, promoting bilingual rights and shared public spaces. Indeed, a functional hybrid approach to multilingualism, emphasizing actual language use in daily contexts, proves more practical than focusing solely on linguistic competence at the monolingual level. Plurilingual individuals possess a unique linguistic configuration where multiple systems coexist and interact (Grosjean 1989; García & Wei 2014). A prevalent monolingual perspective may lead bilingual individuals to underestimate their language abilities, potentially contributing to language loss, as observed with immigrant parents favoring English over their heritage language in English-speaking countries (Grosjean 1989; Winsler et al. 2014; see also Kim & Starks 2010).

Given this dichotomy, the process of linguistic recognition and inclusion is constrained by both ideological, functional, and socio-economic issues associated with managing linguistic diversity. This limitation culminates in a state of oligolingualism (Blommaert 1996). Oligolingualism refers to the reduction of ""the number of (societally, and thus economically, valuable) languages in use"" within a specific territory (Blommaert, Leppänen and Spotti 2012: 6; Blommaert 2018). In this context, language communities occupy differing societal positions linked to their access to resources and power. Consequently, the statuses assigned to languages reflect and reinforce the relative statuses of the communities that speak them (Rindler Schjerve 2007).

Although rooted in underlying social, economic, and political tensions, with language often serving as a symbolic ""stand-in"" for broader conflicts over status and resources (Haslinger 2022), language conflicts may materialize through forms of linguistic bordering (Khan 2022). As scrutinizing citizens at borders serves as a performative act that asserts state sovereignty and national identity, exclusion at linguistic borders reflects and reinforces a nation's sense of linguistic identity and desire for security in the face of permeability and diversity (Blackedge 2005; Salter 2008; Khan 2022). The performative acts that take place at linguistic border may take the form, for instance, of language testing for the accession to citizenship, residency or other specific services. While claiming to promote inclusion, linguistic barriers contribute to create acute social, political and economic disparities, especially if intersectional concerns are also taken into account. Indeed, immigrants with lower education levels, professional work experience in their own language, elder age or significant family caregiving duties imposed by gender dynamics may be disadvantaged in acquiring citizenship under these language requirements (Bassel and Khan 2021). Furthermore, testing instruments designed to evaluate language ability as a neutral form of knowledge frequently have long been proven to encode cultural biases that can have significant discriminatory effects (Djiwandono 2001), while frameworks of reference to evaluate the desired level of language proficiency have been criticized for becoming immigration control instruments (Tracy 2017).

Language border regimes: beyond majority language testing

Following the categorization introduced by Khan (2022), one can identify at least three forms of language border regimes related to language testing:

However, securitization dynamics in language assessment go beyond the evaluation of language proficiency in the majority language of the country of residence.

On the one hand, there are instances in which language border regimes are implemented at substate level, that is, in the case of territorial autonomies for linguistic minorities such as Catalonia or South Tyrol. In these cases, the bordering dynamics already present at state level are simply replicated, while exclusionary attitudes are often motivated by the so-called threat-hypothesis, that is, ""the belief that historical groups frequently perceive large-scale migration as a danger and harbor defensive and exclusionary attitudes towards migrants due to their ethno-centric understanding of identities or due to the fear that migrants will eventually integrate into the central state culture, further outnumbering the old minorities"" (Medda-Windischer & Carlà 2015: 1).

On the other hand, however, one can stress Khan's categories to include another form of language border regime used to control accession to a specific status through indirect forms of language testing, or better, language analysis. This is a language border regime that can be defined as allochthonous (or external) linguistic bordering, and concerns practices such as LADO - Language Assessment for the Determination of Origin, in which proficiency in the declared native language becomes a precondition for the access to refugee status. LADO has been defined as ""a tool used by several immigration departments to assist with the determination of the origin of applicants for international protection, often in cases where there is a lack of reliable identity documents or uncertainty related to the ethnicity and the country of origin/residence of an applicant"" (EUAA 2022: 9). Specifically, when immigration officers doubt the accuracy of an asylum seeker's origin claims, they conduct language analysis interviews. Typically led by immigration officers or specialized private companies, these interviews aim to assess the credibility of the individual's statements about their national, regional, or ethnic background. The analysis also evaluates whether the recorded speech authentically represents the person's natural way of speaking or if they are attempting to mimic a specific background (Eades 2009).

LADO procedures have long been criticized for their methods of evaluation as well as for the competence of those involved in the evaluation process (Maryns 2004; Eades 2005; Fraser 2011; Patrick 2012; Ateek and Rasinger 2018; Matras 2018). However, the most contentious point in the reliability and fairness of not only LADO, but also any other form of language bordering, is precisely the abovementioned clash between a unrealistic monoglossic perspective on language, language use and language belonging and the actual real-world scenario in which the fuzziness of language borders and the dynamism of plurilingual practices are hardly encapsulated into predetermined static categories based on the illusion of a standard language proficiency. Indeed, it may be also claimed that the very act of erecting linguistic barriers is executed through the evaluation of an unrealist idea of language proficiency either in the native or in the majority language.

Policy Recommendations: border weakening through border complexification

The main issue regarding these evaluations of proficiency as securitization processes is twofold. On the one hand, they are ""driven by an ideology of language that makes 'time and space static' and disregards the sociolinguistic reality of language as a dynamic repertoire of resources"" (Matras 2018: 69). While, on the other hand, language assessment either through testing or analysis often overlooks the importance of the context of use as an influencing factor in the development and acquisition of specific individual repertoires, and as a sociolinguistic environment in which to 'spend' these acquired competences.

Specifically, language borders or barriers lay their foundations on a general disregard of the following socio-linguistic features:

Taking into account these complexities in language identification, language use and language belonging does not nevertheless mean to disregard any form of language assessment, if this is deemed necessary for the accession to specific services or statuses. However, these assessments should not be guided by securitizing purposes with exclusionary effects, while the acquisition of language proficiency in the official language(s) should not be equated to a successful process of integration - or better assimilation.

In terms of policy recommendations, this process of complexification of language borders would ultimately demand a rethinking of what language assessments want to evaluate, for which reasons, how they are designed and conducted, as well as to who they target.

In conclusion, this policy paper argues for a transformative approach to language assessment aimed at steering away from securitization objectives, while fostering inclusivity and promoting a nuanced understanding of linguistic repertoires. By recognizing and accommodating language variations, contextual nuances, and intersectional concerns, the proposed changes aspire to break down - or at least weaken - the rigid language borders erected by traditional forms of language assessment. In doing so, the complexification of language borders becomes not only as a pragmatic response to contemporary linguistic realities but also as a crucial step towards linguistic justice and equity in diverse societies.

Previously, I touched on Nissan Motor's financial outlook and shareholder capital return in my December 21, 2023 write-up. My latest update details NSANY's recent news flow and developments which have positive read-throughs for the company's future share price and financial performance.

My decision is to upgrade my rating for Nissan Motor from a Hold to a Buy, as I think that the company's pace of electrification and China business recovery might exceed the market's expectations.

Nissan Motor's shares can be traded on the OTC (Over-The-Counter) market and the Japanese stock market. The three-month mean daily trading values for its OTC shares and Japan-listed shares were approximately $1 million and $120 million, respectively as per S&P Capital IQ data. Investors can deal in Nissan Motors' relatively more liquid Japanese shares by utilizing the international markets trading services offered by US brokerages such as Interactive Brokers.

A 2023 Economist commentary piece noted that ""Japan and its carmakers are lagging in the race towards EVs"" highlighting that the EV penetration rate in the Japanese market is in the low single-digit percentage level. Nissan Motor's goal is to increase the company's ""electrification mix"" on a worldwide basis to 44% and 55% by 2026 and 2030, respectively as part of its long-term financial plan referred to as ""Nissan Ambition 2030.""

It is encouraging to know that NSANY seems to have the intention to move faster on the path of electrification with potential partnerships and investments.

A March 13, 2024 Seeking Alpha News article cited a report from TV Tokyo which indicated that NSANY and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC) are working together to ""collaborate on technology, development, production, and parts procurement in EVs"" which will allow Nissan to ""streamline its management and share the costs in developing EVs."" On March 15, 2024, Nissan Motor confirmed in an official announcement that it will embark on a ""feasibility study of a strategic partnership"" with Honda. Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Honda, and Nissan are the three largest Japanese automotive companies, so a potential collaboration between the two of them (Nissan and Honda) is a very significant development assuming that it materializes.

Separately, Nissan Motor could potentially be an investor in US EV maker Fisker Inc. (FSR), as per a March 1, 2024 Seeking Alpha News report that referenced an article from Reuters. Previously, the market believed that NSANY would take a couple of years (or as early as 2030) to introduce an EV pick-up truck as part of its lineup., and this assumption might no longer hold true. A potential investment in FSR might translate into an acceleration of Nissan Motor's new product plans relating to electric pick-up trucks based on the source quoted in the Reuters report.

According to a research report titled ""Stimulating Capital And Return On Capital"" published by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), ""public company valuations are differentiating companies with favorable environmental and social performance"" and ""lower (carbon) emitters"" as compared to their peers. Specifically, businesses which are doing better in the area of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and contributing less carbon emissions can command EV/EBITDA multiples that are on average a high teens percentage higher than their counterparts as per GS' research.

It won't be surprising that Nissan Motor's shares witness a positive valuation re-rating if the market perceives that the company's actual pace of electrification could turn out to be faster than expected with the help of partnerships and investments.

In my late December 2023 article for NSANY, I highlighted that ""China, Nissan Motor's largest market in terms of retail sales for FY 2022, is a weak spot for the company."" The recent read-throughs from management comments and sales data indicate that there is a good chance of Nissan Motor witnessing a meaningful improvement in the performance of its Mainland Chinese business operations.

Nissan Motors' unit sales for China grew strongly by +37.9% YoY to 65,553 units in the first month of this year based on the latest data available.

At its Q3 FY 2023 (October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023) analyst briefing in February 2024, NSANY explained that its approach in the short term to ""focus on markets where customers still prefer very much more ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)"" vehicles and the ""established brands (like Nissan versus the new EV start-ups)."" This approach has been successful as evidenced by the robust January 2024 unit sales in the Mainland Chinese market. In specific terms, Nissan Motor is placing its emphasis on lower-tier Chinese cities where the competitive intensity is milder.

More significantly, Nissan Motor intends to introduce a new electric vehicle model, the first of four new models in the pipeline, to the Chinese market in the calendar year 2024 (source: third quarter results briefing). This bodes well for NSANY's intermediate to long-term plans to gain market share in Mainland China's automotive market.

Nissan Motor could possibly achieve better-than-expected progress with its electrification plans by leveraging partnerships and investments. On the other hand, the outlook for NSANY's China business operations has turned more favorable.

The stock is now trading at 7.2 times the consensus FY 2024 (YE March 31, 2024) EV/EBITDA as per S&P Capital IQ valuation data. In comparison, Nissan Motor's mean consensus next twelve months' EV/EBITDA valuation multiple was higher at 11.5 times for the three-year period between 2017 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). My view is that Nissan Motor's EV/EBITDA valuation multiple can expand to be closer to its historical average, assuming that the performance of its Chinese business improves and its electrification mix increases at a faster pace.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Value Pendulum,0.3019607843137255,448733745,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458097575/image_458097575.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

However, due to the increase of imported bananas this year and the delayed arrival of Chinese bananas caused by weather conditions, the peak season for imported bananas is expected to extend into April.

""This period witnesses a concentration of banana imports, particularly from Southeast Asia. Production in the Philippines has declined while other producing regions have seen an uptick in production or imports."" Mr. Lin Mingxian of Shanghai ZhangXin International Trade Co., Ltd., a company specializing in imported bananas from Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, Ecuador, and other regions, noted.

Lin highlighted, ""This year, the low production of Philippine bananas has driven prices higher, creating a notable price gap with Vietnamese bananas. While Philippine bananas were historically prized for their taste, this season's quality hasn't met expectations, whereas the quality of Vietnamese and Cambodian bananas has improved.""

""Vietnamese bananas have better overall properties and more affordable prices; Cambodian bananas have better peel appearance and prices are between those from the Philippines and Vietnam. The appeal of the two to the market is increasing. In the past two or three years, the Chinese market's enthusiasm for Philippine bananas has waned, and consumption has gradually turned to bananas from Vietnam and Cambodia.""

""Vietnamese bananas offer better overall qualities at more affordable prices, while Cambodian bananas boast better peel appearance and fall between Philippine and Vietnamese bananas in terms of pricing. The market preference is shifting towards Vietnamese and Cambodian bananas. Over the past few years, enthusiasm for Philippine bananas in the Chinese market has waned, with consumers increasingly turning to alternatives.""

In terms of pricing and sales, Lin explained that current prices of imported bananas are approximately 25% lower than in the same period last year, resulting in sluggish sales. He attributed this to the influx of banana arrivals and the prevailing consumption environment. Lin added, ""In addition to the aforementioned sources, imports from Myanmar and Laos have notably increased this year, with arrivals peaking during this period. Moreover, the introduction of bananas from Hainan, China, has exerted some influence on the prices of imported bananas. Traditionally, banana prices tend to rise in anticipation of the Qingming Festival (April 4). However, there hasn't been a noticeable change in prices yet.""

Discussing market trends, Lin predicted that prices would gradually rise over the next two to three weeks as the volume of imported bananas decreases. He anticipated a more pronounced price increase trend by mid-April.

It's the latest move by Microsoft to make its Copilot AI tools a standard for businesses, part of its broader competition with other enterprise tech providers including Google, Salesforce, Amazon, and others.

As part of the event, the company detailed ongoing integrations of AI features into Microsoft software including Windows, Teams, OneNote, and other applications widely used by businesses.

The coming days are likely to bring with it a major milestone for Solana (SOL) as it looks to integrate the United States dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin on its platform.

The Solana USDC integration push comes with the launch of Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) only a few days away. This development is likely to be a game changer for the Solana ecosystem in the long run. The scheduled date for the CCTP launch on the Solana mainnet is March 26, and Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire touted the coming event on X when he noted that a big launch is coming.

USDC issuer Circle is preparing for the launch by putting structures into place to facilitate the smooth implementation. Consequently, the firm declared that it has enhanced developers' capacity to build out integration on the Solana devnet by updating the necessary information.

Noteworthy, CCTP was initially introduced by Circle as its proprietary stablecoin transfer protocol. The CCTP was launched on Arbitrum last year weeks after the launching of USDC on the same network. This makes Solana the second non-AVM chain to welcome the CCTP function. These launches are aimed at facilitating the easy movement of the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling network.

Precisely, CCTP runs as an on-chain utility protocol that improves USDC transfer between different blockchains. It leverages native burning and minting to complete its activities.

Above all, the CCTP brings a lot of benefits to give it a competitive edge amongst which is capital efficiency and a reduction in trust needs during USDC transfer between blockchain networks. Developers can now utilize the CCTP to build innovative cross-chain apps that cut across the capabilities of trading, loans, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), payments, and even gambling.

The implementation of the CCTP and the Solana USDC integration is bound to impact the utilization and adoption of SOL.

In terms of price, the crypto has been performing well and it even outperformed Ethereum (ETH) recently when it breached the $200 resistance. At press time, SOL was trading at a price of $186.35 with a 6.75% increase within the last 24 hours.

The Honorable Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, CanNor and PrairiesCan, announced today, while delivering a keynote address at the Arctic Energy and Resources Symposium, that Nukik Corporation was to receive an additional $2.8 million in funding from the Canadian ARDEC North program to move the Kivalliq hydroelectric link and fiber optic project to the next stage.

Led by Nukik, an Inuit-owned company, this project involves constructing 1,200 km of a 150-megawatt transmission line with fiber optic cables to connect Manitoba's grid to the Kivalliq region of Nunavut. This nation-building project would allow five communities and at least one gold mine to move away from costly and polluting diesel and benefit from high-speed Internet service in the region. It would also significantly reduce the risks associated with the transport of heavy fuels on Arctic waters as well as fuel spills in communities.

This funding will make it possible to undertake the project development stage activities necessary to get it underway: engineering, design and environmental work in the field. It builds on previous federal funding which made it possible to complete the planning and verification stages of the project's feasibility. Construction work is expected to begin by 2028.

Many northern communities still rely on diesel, a costly and polluting fuel that contributes to climate change, for power and heating. This Inuit-led project will play an important role in reducing energy costs and pollution in the Kivalliq region while contributing to the creation of local jobs and multi-generational socio-economic benefits.

By promoting Indigenous leadership on climate, Canada is implementing Measure 46 of the Action Plan for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.

A recent announcement from Samsung's head of mobile division suggests a potential shift in the company's approach to integrating AI features into its older Galaxy smartphone series.

According to a report on Naver, TM Roh, the head of the Samsung division suggested the idea of bringing Galaxy AI support to the Galaxy S22 lineup during the company's annual general shareholders meeting. He mentioned that they are currently assessing the feasibility of incorporating AI features into this two-year series.

The effectiveness of Galaxy AI technology heavily depends on a device's hardware capabilities. Samsung aims to create a ""hybrid AI"" system that combines on-device processing with cloud-based functions. However, Roh noted that there isn't a difference in capabilities between the Galaxy S22 and the Galaxy S23 FE, which is eligible for the AI upgrade.

Roh highlighted that Samsung is progressively outlining strategies to provide Galaxy AI support for the S22 series. Nonetheless, he acknowledged limitations that need addressing before moving with implementation. Therefore there may be challenges due to the configuration of the S22 series.

Apart from discussing AI integration Roh also mentioned Samsungs interest, in developing an Android phone. Indicated that they are steadily advancing in this area. The company is internally evaluating market demand and potential consumer interest in such a device.

In relation to choosing not to release the S22 series as mentioned back in January, it's important to mention that both the S22 and the S23 FE models are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC. This indicates that there were probably reasons influencing Samsungs choice besides the processor.

In the meantime, owners of Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, or S22 Ultra can anticipate the upcoming One UI 6.1 update, which is expected to bring new features and enhancements to their devices.",technosports.co.in,news,TechnoSports,,0.1607843137254903,448731735,1,https://technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2-6-jpg.webp,eng-9409309

The family of Peter Mukuha Kago is embroiled in a property row, with one of his daughters seeking to be named administrator.

Numerous legal battles involving the children of the late Kago, the patriarch who died in 2010, have been lodged in court.

Disputes involving Naivas Limited shares and Kago's estate have been in the courts since 2012.

Justice H.M Nyaga ruled on March 11, 2024, that a copy of the will was proved at his court.

He noted that the administration of all the estate of the deceased which by law devolves to and vests in his representative was granted to David Kimani Mukuha and Grace Wambui Mukuha.

""Please note that this grant cannot be used to transfer any of the property of the deceased,"" read part of the grant signed by Justice Heston Nyaga.

In the will, Kago wants his clothing to be given to family members except ties, which should be given to the church.

Therefore, it is extremely important to maintain air parameters that allow you to feel thermal comfort. Thermal comfort affects human wellbeing, but also affects work efficiency or learning effectiveness. Being in rooms where comfort is not maintained reduces the efficiency of work and learning, resulting in increases in the absenteeism of employees and students. In addition, the modern drive for energy efficiency reduces air exchange. Insufficient air exchange can cause thermal discomfort and symptoms of sick building syndrome. This, in turn, can cause irreversible health effects.

The purpose of this Special Issue is to evaluate indoor thermal comfort and to develop good practises in building use. Original results of field and controlled research and subjective surveys, models, and review articles on thermal comfort and the proper functioning of buildings are welcome.

Three of Caltrain's eventual 23 electric train sets have completed a thousand miles of testing along the Caltrain corridor. The entirety of the new fleet must meet all safety and quality standards prior to the launch of electrified service in Fall 2024.

This 1,000 mile testing process is required to ensure all safety and quality standards are met in order to ensure that the trains can safely operate on Caltrain's tracks. The trainsets will continue to undergo additional testing before they can be deemed ready for passenger service in 2024. Caltrain currently has six train sets on property, with the remainder expected to arrive from the Stadler US manufacturing facility in Utah over the next year.

""Rigorous testing of equipment is how we make sure that our corridor remains safe for passengers and the communities we serve"" said Executive Director Michelle Bouchard. ""I thank our crews for all their hard work testing these vehicles through the night while we continue to carry passengers during the day. I look forward to the rest of the new fleet going through the same safety testing process and for the rollout of this impressive fleet for our passengers later this year.""

Caltrain's historic Electrification Project is the first undertaking in North America in a generation in which diesel trains and their infrastructure components are transitioned to an electrified system. Electrification means faster and more frequent service, including doubling the frequency on weekends. The passenger experience will be greatly improved as well with the new trains featuring wi-fi, power outlets at every seat, onboard displays with digital trip information, increased storage capacities.

Electrification will also help meet ambitious regional and state climate action goals by lowering greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and relieving traffic congestion. Additionally, electrified service will advance equity along the corridor by reducing noise and air pollution while increasing access for priority equity communities. It will also set the framework for California's future High Speed Rail network that will run on the Caltrain corridor.

The proposed Electrification service plan would see weekday peak hour trains go to 79 stations per hour, an increase from the current 66. Eleven stations would experience four train arrivals hourly per direction, a notable improvement from seven stations currently. Midday trains would cover 44 stations per hour, up from 34 today.

The Electrification of the Caltrain coincides with the 160th anniversary of passenger rail service. There will be another train public tour and celebration of the anniversary in the spring.",railroad.net,news,RAILROAD.NET,,0.3176470588235294,448730437,1,,

At the design stage of such applications, numerical modeling is required to predict flow field properties and thermal energy transport between components to guarantee their optimal performance and lifetime. Depending upon the degree of rarefaction in the system, determined by the Knudsen number (Kn), different modeling approaches can be used to study the rarefied gas dynamics. In the case of low to moderate degree of rarefaction (Kn < 0.1) the continuum approach, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, is the most common simulation approach. On the other hand, for a highly rarefied gas (Kn \(\ge\) 0.1), particle-based simulation techniques, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) (Allen and Tildesley 2017), Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) (Bird and Brady 1994), and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) (Chen and Doolen 1998), are typically employed to determine flow field properties. Among these techniques, DSMC is the most commonly used one that has been successfully applied in a broad range of engineering applications (Karniadakis et al. 2006). Nevertheless, prescribing accurate boundary conditions at the gas-surface interface is a vital parameter to achieving reliable results in DSMC. In fact, going toward a higher degree of rarefaction, the complex physical interactions at the interface become even more dominant than the gas-gas interactions happening at the bulk of the fluid (Shen 2006; Zhang et al. 2012). Therefore, a detailed understanding of such interfacial nanoscale phenomena is of extreme importance in rarefied gas dynamics.

The diffuse reflection scattering model was the first boundary model used to describe the scattering process in rarefied gases (Shen 2006). This model assumes that the reflected gas molecules are fully accommodated with the adjacent solid surface, and their outgoing velocity distribution is determined by the Maxwellian distribution based on the wall temperature. However, later experimental studies (Devienne et al. 1965; Gregory and Peters 1986) revealed that the complete diffuse reflection assumption is not always valid. For example, at a very clean or high-temperature surface or under ultra vacuum conditions, gas molecules can experience near specular reflection. Consequently, to establish more comprehensive boundary models, researchers proposed various empirical scattering kernels that could anticipate both specular and diffuse reflections in specific rarefied gas flow applications (Maxwell 1878; Epstein 1967; Cercignani and Lampis 1971; Lord 1989, 1991; Yamanishi et al. 1999; Yamamoto et al. 2006; Yakunchikov et al. 2012; Hossein Gorji and Jenny 2014; Frezzotti and Gibelli 2008). The performance of these scattering kernels normally depends on several parameters, known as accommodation coefficients (ACs). In these scattering kernels, ACs are applied to quantify the accommodating level of different kinetic energy modes of gas molecules on a neighboring solid surface. The Cercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) scattering kernel is one of the most employed scattering kernels that can be utilized to describe the scattering process for both monoatomic and diatomic gas molecules (Lord 1991). Despite the acceptable performance of the classical scattering kernels in the systems near equilibrium conditions, it was shown that these models are incapable of fully capturing the complex physical phenomena, such as a considerable temperature jump, happening in systems in a highly non-equilibrium situation (Yamamoto et al. 2007; Liang et al. 2013). This shortcoming, alongside the lack of generality of such scattering kernels, raises the need for more elaborated gas scattering kernels.

As the most accurate particle-based simulation approach, an MD simulation is a valuable tool for studying interfacial nanoscale phenomena. In an MD simulation, the interactions between individual gas molecules with neighboring solid molecules are modeled deterministically. This fact makes MD computationally very expensive. Therefore, its application is usually restricted to the nanoscale level. Nevertheless, an MD simulation is exploited in various approaches for investigating interfacial physics. Most commonly, MD is used to compute different ACs between a gas-solid pair. These ACs are then fed into one of the previously discussed empirical scattering kernels that are served as boundary conditions for high scale simulation approaches such as DSMC (Watvisave et al. 2015).

Other researchers developed hybrid simulation schemes combining the classical MD and DSMC approaches to study rarefied gas flow at mesoscale level (Nedea et al. 2005; Yamamoto et al. 2006; Liang and Ye 2014; Watvisave et al. 2015; Longshaw et al. 2020). In these schemes, the simulation domain is decomposed into smaller regions. To benefit the precision of MD and the speed of DSMC at the same time, the first approach is applied in the vicinity of the solid surfaces, while the latter one is utilized in the bulk of the domain. Although these hybrid schemes are relatively faster than pure MD, since a large number of solid atoms must still be simulated in the MD part, these schemes are computationally expensive. In addition, there are considerable differences in the order of magnitude of time and space between MD and DSMC. Therefore, while applying these hybrid schemes, special attention must be taken into account to ensure particle and energy conservation at the coupling interfaces.

Another category of wall scattering kernels is nonparametric scattering kernels (Liao et al. 2018; Andric et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021). Unlike the classical empirical scattering kernels, no intermediate calibration based on ACs is needed, and MD data are used directly to construct these scattering kernels. These scattering kernels generally show better performance in the highly non-equilibrium situation compared to the classical scattering kernels (Andric et al. 2019). As a first step to constructing these scattering kernels, single gas molecules with independent thermal velocities are beamed onto a specific solid surface in an MD simulation. Then, the discrete gas molecule trajectories, characterized by the system's initial condition, such as gas molecular velocity or surface conditions, are gathered in a database. Based on the relation between the precollisional and postcollisional molecular velocity vectors in the MD dataset, a conditional probability density function is derived that can be used for sampling the reflected gas molecular velocity depending on its initial state. Liu et al. (2021) developed such a scattering kernel and coupled it to a DSMC code to model hypersonic flow over a rounded wedge. Comparing the simulation results with another case study, in which the CLL scattering kernel was used as the boundary model, showed that the DSMC code based on their proposed model performs better in describing different flow properties. Nevertheless, in all these scattering kernels, the gas-gas interactions that can affect the reflected gas molecules properties in the early transition regime \((0.1<\hbox {Kn} < 1)\) are ignored, and these wall models cannot deal with adsorption-related problems. Besides, the usual nonparametric approximations of high-dimensional multimultivariate data can be a complex task requiring advanced learning methods (Sung 2004). To avoid this problem, before the main fitting step, usually various techniques are employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (Andric et al. 2019).

Machine learning is another promising technique that can be used to establish a gas scattering kernel directly based on the collisional data obtained from MD simulations (Liao et al. 2018; Mohammad Nejad et al. 2021, 2022; Wang et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2022). As an example, in our previous works (Mohammad Nejad et al. 2021, 2022), the Gaussian mixture (GM) approach, an unsupervised machine learning approach, was employed to construct a scattering kernel for monoatomic gases (Ar, He) interacting with the Au surface and diatomic gases (\(\hbox {H}_{2}\), \(\hbox {N}_{2}\)) interacting with the Ni surface, respectively. In these studies, a two parallel walls MD setup was used as the reference system to include the impact of both gas-wall and gas-gas interactions on the postcollisional behavior of gas molecules. The physical and stochastic properties predicted by the GM scattering kernel were assessed against the CLL model results and the original MD data in the Fourier thermal and the combined Fourier-Couette flow problems. It was illustrated that the GM model outperforms the CLL model in both benchmark systems. The main advantage of the GM approach-driven scattering kernel over the empirical scattering kernels is that its performance does not rely on a finite number of parameters. In fact, we can adjust the number of fitting parameters to get the best performance from the scattering kernel. Wang et al. (2021) used a data-based scattering kernel model for gas-solid interactions. The main advantage of our GM scattering approach over this approach is that in the case of the GM scattering model the MD results have been used as a whole and the velocity components are not separated from each other. Therefore, the interplay between different velocity components or energy modes (in the case of diatomic molecules) will be fully taken into account in the case of our GM approach. In addition, unlike nonparametric approaches whose extension to higher dimensions is limited (Sung 2004), the GM scattering kernel can handle high-dimensional data sets rather straightforwardly. To the best of our knowledge, the scattering kernel based on the GM approach has not been coupled to a DSMC solver before to study rarefied gas flow systems.

Knowing the vital importance of the applied scattering kernels in rarefied gas modeling, the main objective in this work is to develop a robust gas scattering model for higher scale simulation techniques. To fulfill this goal, we investigate the capability of the GM-driven scattering kernels to be used as a boundary model in a DSMC solver. Besides, we develop a dedicated mechanism which can be used to efficiently couple the GM scattering kernel to a DSMC solver. Initially, based on a two parallel walls system, the interactions of Ar gas with an Au surface and \(\hbox {H}_{2}\) gas with a Ni surface are studied using MD simulations. Two benchmark problems are considered: an equilibrium gas system confined between isothermal walls and a Fourier thermal problem. For the Ar-Au system, the pre- and postcollisional translational velocities of Ar molecules are used for training the GM model. Whereas, for the \(\hbox {H}_{2}\)-Ni system, both translational and rotational velocities are employed for the training purpose. Such consideration guarantees the model ability to anticipate the possible energy transfer between the translational and rotational modes at non-equilibrium conditions. Implementing the GM model on the MD collisional data in each case study, a conditional multivariate probability distribution is derived that can be used to generate the postcollisional velocities of gas molecules based on their precollisional states. The GM approach-driven boundary models for the Ar-Au and \(\hbox {H}_{2}\)-Ni are incorporated in pure DSMC simulations based on a one-to-one mapping between the corresponding MD and DSMC simulation setups. The DSMC simulations coupled to the GM scattering kernel (GM-DSMC) results are evaluated against the DSMC simulations coupled to the CLL scattering kernel (CLL-DSMC) and the reference MD solutions. The evaluation is performed based on different physical and stochastic criteria.",link.springer.com,news,Springer,,0.3019607843137255,448729425,51,https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10404-024-02719-x/MediaObjects/10404_2024_2719_Fig1_HTML.png,

As a journalist covering climate, he's had years of experience reporting on electrification, energy, and technology -- and demystifying those often complex topics for the average consumer. But the decision to write about his own experiences as a homeowner attempting to ditch fossil fuels came about two-thirds of the way through what amounted to more than a yearlong process.

""I said, 'OK, if I spend all my days on this and I'm learning so much, maybe other people will learn something, too,'"" he recalled.

Residential energy use accounts for roughly one-sixth of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Our homes remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and natural gas in particular. But that's beginning to change -- electric heat pump sales are outpacing gas boilers, and some cities have passed resolutions banning the use of natural gas in new construction. Legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act has also sought to make it cheaper and more accessible for Americans to upgrade their home energy systems and appliances to more efficient ones.

Still, that doesn't mean that renovating a home to be more climate-friendly is easy, or cheap, as Tik and his wife discovered. Even a pair of climate journalists encountered obstacles and tough decisions over the course of a process that took several times longer than they initially expected.

""Build in time,"" Tik recommends to anyone pondering similar upgrades. ""It's gonna take longer than you think.""

He chronicled his and his wife's experiences in a first-person feature for Grist, which published today -- and he shared a few of his top takeaways for Looking Forward. In addition to budgeting more time than you think you'll need, Tik recommended leaning on family and friends who have been early adopters of things like heat pumps, induction stoves, and solar panels.

""It's only a matter of time -- if not already -- before someone on your block has a heat pump, and if you ask them about their process, you could probably skip a whole lot of steps,"" he said. Shortly after he and his wife installed heat pumps on their two-story home in Burlington, Vermont, a neighbor who had noticed the contractor's truck in their driveway called to ask about it and see if she could hire the same installer. ""I think my neighbor probably saved three months of work,"" Tik said. ""And my friend is just about to do the same; my dad will do the same.""

A home's heating system is the big-ticket item, in terms of financial investment and emissions-saving potential. For Tik and his wife, the journey leading up to installation involved a comparison of different models of heat pumps, a lengthy detour exploring rooftop solar (to offset some of the energy demands, and cost, of their new all-electric systems), and a brief moment of panic when they feared they'd have to upgrade their electrical panel. They worked through each of these decisions one by one, culminating in a successful -- even joyful -- installation in early January.

We've pulled an excerpt from Tik's feature below (lightly edited for clarity), highlighting some of the other, lower-lift projects that he and his wife tackled to begin weaning the full house off of natural gas. Check out the full feature, with all its twists and turns, here.

Our first foray into discarding gas was installing a heat pump water heater. It works a bit like an air conditioner in reverse by drawing warmth from the surrounding air to bring water up to temperature, and the technology is growing in popularity. Not only are heat pumps energy-efficient, they can also do a bit of dehumidification, which our musty basement sorely needed. The process went deceptively smoothly.

We gathered several quotes -- something the [director of research for the electrification nonprofit Rewiring America] and others told me is critical to managing costs. The lowest was $2,825 to install a 50-gallon tank, a price that was on the high end of Energy Star guidance but hundreds less than the others. A $600 instant rebate from the state and an $800 post-purchase one from the city brought the cost to $1,425. I happened to have a friend who needed one too, so we both got another $150 off for doing them together. The IRA provides a tax credit of 30 percent of the total cost (up to $2,000), though we won't get it until after we file our taxes.

All told, the bill will come to $428, plus a couple hundred more to have an electrician wire it. Installation took less than a day and the water heater is now humming happily in our basement. Although the emissions savings will be negligible because we still need our boiler for space heating, it was a confident first stride toward reducing our dependence on gas.

Buoyed by the success, we took aim at the stove and the dryer.

Electrifying appliances isn't yet a major climate win. The average dryer uses around 2,000 cubic feet of natural gas a year, with CO2 emissions roughly equivalent to driving about 300 miles. Gas stoves consume about the same amount. At best, going electric fully displaces those greenhouse gases. But the advantages are even smaller beyond Vermont, where local utilities aren't as clean. The nation still generates 60 percent of its electricity with fossil fuels (43 percent of that from natural gas) and until that changes, junking a gas stove is roughly a wash for the planet.

Our main motivation for jettisoning gas appliances was the blinking light on our air purifier. We'd read the research showing that cooking over gas produces benzene and nitrogen dioxide. But seeing that little diode change from a soft blue to a harsh red every time we cooked was a menacing reminder of the risks. It grew even more unsettling when we found out we'd become parents, as gas stoves have been linked to nearly 13 percent of the nation's childhood asthma cases.

The consensus among climate experts and, perhaps equally importantly, chefs is that the best alternative is an induction stove, which uses electromagnetic energy to heat cookware. It requires less energy than a traditional electric range and offers greater temperature control. But as we started exploring options, we quickly realized the technology doesn't come cheap. The least expensive models start at around $1,100, or almost twice the price of a basic gas stove. Advocates of the tech say prices should come down as it becomes more widespread, but that didn't do us much good, and our city's rebate was just $200. We hoped Black Friday would further blunt the financial blow, though that meant waiting a few months. We used the time to weigh whether we wanted features such as a convection oven (we did) and, come November, headed to Lowe's.

Given my proclivity for buying power tools I don't need, my wife hustled me directly to the appliances. Alas, the store had just one induction model on display, and it wasn't the one we wanted. But the conventional stoves were similar enough that we could get a sense of how the induction version might feel in the kitchen. After much pressing, twisting, hemming, and hawing, we chose a Samsung induction model with knobs rather than buttons, which we knew from a relative's experience could be finicky. The list price was $2,249, but we got it for nearly half off with the holiday sale.

On the way out, we solved our dryer dilemma when we happened upon a well-reviewed electric model similarly marked down to just $648. We pulled out our phones and compared it to a heat pump dryer, which would have used less electricity and spared us the trouble of installing another outlet and a vent. But aside from being considerably more expensive (even with an extra state rebate), the heat pump version had just half the capacity. Given the mountains of laundry newborns produce, we chose the traditional tech, with the hope that larger models are available next time we need a dryer.

Leaving the store, I nearly blew our savings on a track saw. Good job I showed restraint, as installing outlets to power our purchases was much more expensive than expected. The electrician charged more than $600 for the stove hookup, and the dryer outlet, when our basement revamp is ready to accommodate it, will likely run about the same. Although that's about two-thirds the cost of appliances, we saw the benefits of ditching gas almost immediately.

My wife does most of the cooking and swoons when she switches on an induction burner. Water boils far faster than with the gas stove and even more quickly than in our electric kettle. ""It feels almost instant,"" she said. ""The bubbles are crazy."" The heat is also precise enough to keep pasta sauce at a simmer and food perfectly warm while we gather our dinner plates.

Best of all, it's been months since we've seen the red light on our air purifier.

CORRECTION: In last week's newsletter, about alternatives to synthetic fabrics, we failed to note that textile recycling company Renewcell filed for bankruptcy last month. Next steps for the company, its patented technology, and its stores of recycled material are uncertain.

Although Tik and his wife ultimately decided against putting solar panels on their roof, they are now looking into community solar -- an arrangement that lets neighbors buy into a larger solar installment in a centralized location, like a school or a church. Here's one such project on Crystal Spring Farm in Brunswick, Maine. The panels are cooperatively owned, and they provide energy to the farm as well as several nearby families that wouldn't otherwise have access to solar power individually.",grist.org,news,Grist,,0.2078431372549019,448729321,1,https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/0321_Decarb_Social.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,

The latest breakthrough in photovoltaics was not a small step, but a quantum leap. A developing country wants to surpass the U.S. and Europe in power generation. The proposal? The largest solar park in history, which can even be seen from space and is bigger than Singapore. Did you imagine it could be real?

The Bhadla Solar Park in northwest India is truly enormous in scale. When completed, it will span an area of around 80 square kilometres - making it comparable in size to the entire country of Singapore.

The Bhadla park is being built in multiple phases. Phase I and II have already added over 1,000 MW of solar capacity. When finished, the total solar capacity across all phases will reach 2,245 MW, making this one of the largest solar parks in the world.

To put its sheer size into perspective, it covers an area bigger than Manhattan. Driving through the park from end to end would take over an hour. Thousands of acres of desert have been transformed into a sea of solar panels powering hundreds of thousands of homes.

The Bhadla Solar Park utilizes high efficiency solar photovoltaic panels mounted on single axis trackers that follow the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy generation. The solar panels are made of monocrystalline silicon cells and have an efficiency rating of over 20%. Combining high performance panels with solar tracking allows this massive solar park to generate optimal levels of solar electricity.

The solar trackers tilt the panels east to west to ensure the panels are perpendicular to the sun's rays as the sun traverses the sky. This tracking mechanism increases energy generation by 20-30% compared to fixed tilt systems.

Solar tracking technology along with improvements in solar panel efficiency are key factors enabling the construction of gigawatt-scale solar parks like the one at Bhadla. The technology refinements allow such mammoth clean energy projects to maximize energy output while minimizing land usage.

The Bhadla Solar Park in India provides solar power at a much larger scale in the region once complete. The phase I-through-IV of the capacity will total 2,245 MW by the end. Being the blazing star among the top solar parks in the world, Bhadla will attain this status.

Bearing in mind that this solar power farm in California, Topaz, goes at 550 MW capacity will give a clear idea. Topaz was hailed as the gigantic solar farm, which had the highest capacity.

Had it been completed, the Bhadla's phase IV expansion alone would have added 600 MW, accounting for more than the total generation capacity of all of Topaz together. India has world's century of solar thermal park.

Coming first is the Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park in Andhra Pradesh with a capacity of 1,000 MW Create your Own Personalised T-shirt But the plant's phase four might be operational first, which would be the leader in terms of installed capacity.

It is clear that photovoltaics is going to lead the way in the ecological transition, and will also contribute to bringing a country out of the ""development path"". India wants to become a superpower, now that it is the world's largest country and has even allowed itself a name change.

Shore connection enables the diverse fleet of dredgers, offshore construction and support vessels to avoid carbon emissions by shutting off their engines and drawing on shore power while at berth. Headquartered in Belgium, DEME is a leading contractor in the fields of offshore energy, environmental remediation, dredging and marine infrastructure.

DEME has set itself a goal of cutting 40 percent from the greenhouse gases generated by its fleet by 2030 compared to 2008, moving significantly ahead of the revised emissions reduction target set by the International Maritime Organization in 2023. ABB will install shore power to connect to suitably equipped vessels calling at Vlissingen's DEME base by the end of 2024, as part of the ""Temporary Shore Power Grant Scheme for Marine Vessels 2022 - 2023"", a government-supported initiative that stimulates the construction and use of shore power facilities in Dutch seaports.

Offering a key route for ship owners to make measurable progress towards decarbonization, connecting to shore power for energy needs while at berth is expected to become mandatory at main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network from 2030, under FuelEU Maritime regulations.

""This project is part of DEME's wider strategy to integrate its sustainable business goals with daily operations,"" Marc De Boom, Department Manager, DEME Base Vlissingen. ""DEME has high ambitions regarding CO₂ reductions, and we are proud to be the first Belgian marine contractor who achieved the highest level of the CO₂ performance ladder, which is widely used in the Netherlands and Belgium. We are happy to collaborate with ABB, an experienced and reliable technology leader with a solid track record in shore connection installations.""

Awarded after a private tender process, the DEME contract provides a strong example of the way ABB aligns with local interests to ensure that its solutions are flexible in helping meet decarbonization milestones. Ultimately planned as a 2MvA converter, ABB's shoreside shore connection will run at a lower 1.75MvA until the local grid can deliver sufficient capacity between the substation and the power outlet at the dock. In a straightforward installation, the entire solution will be housed in two ISO containers - one 40-ft unit and one 20-ft unit.

""We are delighted to have secured this significant shore connection contract and look forward to working with DEME to support its ambitious commitments for maritime decarbonization,"" said Frank van Delden, Account Manager, ABB Marine & Ports. ""Given the diversity of the DEME fleet, this is a key reference for our shore power technology, showing that almost any type of vessel can avoid emissions by connecting to shore power at the quay.""

Established as the market leading supplier of shipside shore connection solutions, ABB delivered the world's first shore power supply system to the Swedish port of Gothenburg in 2000 and the first shipside installation in 2001. Today, ABB shore connections can be installed on a standardized, pre-assembled basis for integration with all shipboard electricity consumers.

Bentley plans to amp up its supply of plug-in hybrid versions of its luxury vehicles en route to a future in which all of its offerings will be electrified by the start of the coming decade, the brand's CEO says.

In a roundtable discussion with media to discuss the Volkswagen Group brand's 2023 financial results, CEO Adrian Hallmark says Bentley is on target to introduce its first battery-electric model by the end of 2026, a delay from previous announcements that had the brand offering its first BEV in 2025.

In recognition of slackening global demand for BEVs and reductions in government requirements for all-electric vehicles, combined with an understanding of hybrids as a bridge technology, Bentley sees a way forward that offers a mix of hybrids and BEVs to around 2032, Hallmark says. The company previously had planned to shift to a BEV-only lineup by 2030.

At the same time, within a few months the company will end production of its last purely internal-combustion-powered W12 and V-8 models. Alongside the BEV, all Bentley models will be hybrids by 2026, he says.

PHEVs accounted for 27% of Bentley's sales in 2023, with the V-6 PHEV offered in the Bentayga and Flying Spur. With the addition of the V-8 PHEV power in the Continental GT and Flying Spur, Hallmark says he expects a ""massive"" increase in PHEV sales in coming years, although specific estimates were not available.

Overall, Bentley delivered 13,560 units in 2023, third highest in company history, but down 11% compared with 2022. Bentley's profit declined 17% year-over-year, generating $645 million on revenue of $3.2 billion.

As a member of Prof. André Thess' team, he aims to advance the technical foundations for the future energy supply transformation.

""One of my goals here in Stuttgart is to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of Carnot batteries,"" says Ding. Carnot batteries convert surplus electricity from low carbon sources, e.g. renewables, into thermal energy, which can be stored in large scale and converted back into electricity when needed. This addresses the fluctuation and variation nature of wind and solar power generation. Ding is regarded as one of the foremost research figures in this field globally. In Stuttgart, he will be focusing specifically on liquid air energy storage (LAES) - a technology that he invented and led the initial stage of technology development.

Three times thermal energy

LAES is a special form of Carnot battery because it functions without high-temperature heat pumps. ""It works by turning excess electricity into liquid air to be stored in a cryogenic tank,"" explains Ding. For efficiency, apart from the liquid air store (-190 degrees Celsius), high-quality cold (-160 degrees Celsius) and compression heat (~300 degrees Celsius) are also stored, giving a total of three coupled thermal stores. Yulong Ding is deeply involved in developing new methods to enhance the compression heat utilization. To this end, he is actively researching and optimizing cascading processes to make LAES technology more efficient and cost-effective.

Industry without fossil fuels

Secondly, Ding is investigating how the LAES can be integrated into foundation industrial processes through sector coupling. This means that Carnot batteries will not only offer the function of storing surplus solar or wind power, but the stored thermal energy can also be made directly available to industrial processes. These processes require a great deal of heat, which until now has come from fossil sources, e.g. coal and natural gas. ""If we replace fossil heat with renewable heat, we can decarbonize the production of steel, cement, glass, ceramics or chemicals,"" explains Yulong Ding. In Stuttgart, his work will focus specifically on the steel sector, which produces large quantities of greenhouse gases. The aim is to integrate Carnot batteries with ironmaking process - the most energy and carbon intensive part of steel sector.

Waste heat from green hydrogen

Thirdly, Yulong Ding wants to explore what the next generation of energy infrastructure could look like. He envisages a network of highly efficient, cost-effective, multi-sectoral energy services that utilizes as many thermal energy sources as possible. In Stuttgart, Ding wants to investigate the supply chain and find ways to use the waste heat generated during the production, compression, storage and use of hydrogen efficiently and cost-effectively.

Host Professor André Thess is thrilled about the visitor from Birmingham. ""By awarding the Alexander von Humboldt Prize to my esteemed colleague Professor Yulong Ding, the foundation is recognizing his excellence in both basic research and industrial collaborations,"" states Thess. Furthermore, this award signifies the immense importance of affordable, safe, and environmentally friendly thermal energy storage for buildings, industrial processes, and low-CO2 power plants. In collaboration with his guest, Prof. Thess aims not only to research new concepts for storing electrical energy in Carnot batteries but also to explore the potential for industrial partnerships.

Huge storage requirements

Ding emphasizes that energy storage is a crucial component of the future energy system, which will be dominated by renewable energies. ""For me, the role of Carnot batteries is primarily to meet the huge needs for large-scale storage applications with an average runtime of a few hours to several hundred hours."" Advancing this crucial area of technology cannot be achieved by one or two individual organizations alone; it requires the collective efforts of the entire community. The scientist says that he personally will do his utmost to achieve this. Ding feels he is in good hands in Stuttgart: ""Professor André Thess and his team have garnered international acclaim, particularly in the domain of thermal energy conversion and storage."" And the Stuttgart Region is a hub for cutting-edge technology and innovation.

The announcement made by Marco Acuña Mora, ICE's executive president, outlines a project with an estimated investment of $291 million, aiming to bolster the nation's renewable energy portfolio.

This move marks a significant shift from the previous moratorium on new hydroelectric facilities, which was set to last until 2027 to allow for environmental and economic reassessment. ICE's decision to forge ahead with the development of a second plant on the Reventazón River raises both anticipation and concern, signaling a complex balancing act between advancing sustainable energy goals and navigating the environmental challenges posed by climate change.

Currently, the proposal for the new hydroelectric plant remains in the conceptual phase, with pre-feasibility studies yet to be conducted. This crucial step will determine the project's viability, environmental impact, and financial sustainability. As ICE ventures into this ambitious undertaking, the project faces scrutiny from various quarters, highlighting the need for thorough analysis and strategic planning.

A report from the International Energy Agency casts a shadow on the future of hydroelectric projects in the context of climate change. Predictions of reduced rainfall and runoff could jeopardize the operational viability of hydroelectric plants, suggesting a heightened level of risk for investments in such infrastructure. This backdrop of environmental uncertainty underscores the importance of incorporating climate resilience into the planning and execution of renewable energy projects.

Concerns regarding the economic feasibility of the new hydroelectric plant have been voiced by industry stakeholders, including Carlos Montenegro, executive director of the Chamber of Industries of Costa Rica. Montenegro highlights a historical pattern where ICE's projects escalate in cost, often ending up two to three times higher than initial estimates. Moreover, the energy cost produced by the proposed plant is projected to be double that of hydroelectric facilities in neighboring countries, raising questions about competitive pricing and financial prudence.

As Costa Rica forges ahead with its hydroelectric ambitions on the Reventazón River, the project embodies the nation's commitment to renewable energy and environmental stewardship. However, it also presents a complex array of challenges, from ensuring economic viability to addressing the environmental implications of climate change.

The journey towards constructing the new plant at Fourth Cliff will require a multifaceted approach, blending technological innovation, environmental sensitivity, and economic pragmatism. With the global community watching, Costa Rica's endeavor could set a precedent for how nations harness the power of natural resources while safeguarding the planet for future generations.",costaricantimes.com,news,Jaco Super Ride,,0.2784313725490195,448726764,1,https://www.costaricantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/hydropower-costa-rica.jpg,

DETROIT (March 21, 2024) - In a historically unique event for the NTT INDYCAR SERIES, Team Chevy heads west to The Thermal Club for the non-points-paying second round of the 2024 season.

The Thermal $1 Million Challenge is the first race on the 3.067-mile, 19-turn Twin Palms layout for INDYCAR. Despite a weekend with no points on the line, this still is an important event for Team Chevy.

The manufacturer is carrying momentum from the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg into the $1 Million Challenge, having swept first through fourth in the season-opening event. The Bowtie Brigade also showcased strength through hard work and collaboration in the offseason.

With a strong run and solid finish in the first round of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES season, Santino Ferrucci, driver of the No. 14 Sexton Properties Chevrolet for AJ Foyt Racing, discusses the upcoming unique weekend, with testing prior to the heat-race formatted event.

""I think testing is really important for us, especially with our new [technical] partnership, so having more of a two-day test followed up by sprint race weekend, I think, is really nice,"" said Ferrucci. ""It's a little bit more fun. We get a couple more days in California. So I'm quite happy with the idea of the series to move forward with what they're doing. I think that with the gains that we saw in St. Pete with the Chevy engine, it's going to be quite good moving into Thermal.""

With prior heat-racing experience in his career, Ferrucci notes that while the format may be similar, the $1 Million Challenge will be different. ""I feel like it's going to race like a qualifying weekend. Basically, as if you made qualifying the racing. It's very comparable to what we have now for qualifying procedure. Just instead of qualifying for lap time, you're now racing.""

During the two 10-lap (or 20-minute) heat races, pit stops are only allowed for emergency service and teams are allotted one new set of Firestone Firehawks. The top-six finishers from the heat races will then transfer to a 12-car, 20-lap main event Sunday that will see a total purse of $1.756 million, the largest in NTT INDYCAR SERIES history outside of the Indianapolis 500.

The $1 Million Challenge race weekend at The Thermal Club near Palm Springs, Calif. kicks off with open testing from noon p.m. to 2 p.m. ET and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET on Friday. Saturday sees two additional open testing sessions from 12 p.m. ET to 2 p.m. ET and 4 p.m. ET to 6 p.m. ET, followed by qualifications at 8 p.m. ET. Heat events and the 20-lap all-star race air starting at 12:30 p.m. ET on Sunday on NBC. All test sessions and qualifications will be live on Peacock, INDYCAR Radio, and SiriusXM Channel 160.

I'm not sure how it's going to be on the racing side, but by the way the heat races and final race are set up, it's more like sprint racing anyway, so qualifying is going to be quite important. It's going to be good fun, for sure. I'm looking forward to getting to work with Arrow McLaren again in the No. 6 NTT DATA Chevrolet.""

Alexander Rossi, No. 7 Chevrolet at Arrow McLaren:

""Going back to The Thermal Club is something that I think everyone has been really excited about. It's rare that you get a completely new format in motorsports, especially when there is $1 million on the line. It's going to be a cool event and I look forward to seeing what we can achieve.""

Gavin Ward, Team Principal at Arrow McLaren:

""After testing at The Thermal Club last year, I'm excited that we're going back this year for a really different and cool event. I don't think anyone in the series has ever been part of something like this before, and I have to give props to the NTT INDYCAR SERIES for trying something new. We'll all get the opportunity to get a lot of testing in, which I think we need if we're going to race here. Even though this race isn't for points, it's a great chance for us to build off the foundation we laid in St. Pete and bring home some cash while we're at it.""

Christian Rasmussen, No. 20 Chevrolet at Ed Carpenter Racing:

""I'm looking forward to going to The Thermal Club! I have only heard great things about the facility and can't wait to experience it myself. Also with one full race weekend under my belt, a lot of the 'firsts' are out of the way which should benefit us.""

In particular, the report, ""Practical Pathways for Port Decarbonization and Environmental Justice"" offers a series of best practices for net zero-aligned activity and creates measurements for accountability. Specifically, it provides a dashboard with key steps ports can take to help them reach net zero by 2050.

Ports and their contributions to climate change and air pollution have long had a disproportionate impact on communities of color and low-wealth communities. BIL and IRA funding under the federal government's Justice40 Initiative provides ports with opportunities to improve their operations while directly benefiting nearby communities.

Diesel trucks, ships, cargo handling equipment and rail operating in and around ports are significant contributors to emissions and air pollution to neighboring communities.

...said Dr. Margot Brown, Senior Vice President Justice & Equity at Environmental Defense Fund.

Federal investments, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offer ports an unprecedented opportunity to access funding to upgrade their infrastructure and accelerate their transition to zero emissions, while addressing environmental justice concerns.

The report links actions to specific new funding opportunities under recent legislation that ports can leverage and details multiple programs, outlining which opportunities align with both planning and construction projects.

Ports vary dramatically in their commitment to climate action, and this report identifies high-potential opportunities, so they can either start their journey or increase their ambitions.

Ports will play a pivotal role in rapidly decarbonizing our economy in a way that does not leave anyone behind. We have provided a clear path forward for ports to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions that maximizes economic opportunities and benefits to local communities.

...said Dr. Robert Kay, Arup's Americas Climate and Sustainability Services Leader.

Ports have an incredible opportunity from new federal funding programs to advance decarbonization and environmental justice. This report is a great tool meant to help ports take advantage of this chance to improve climate and supply chain resilience across the United States.

....Dr. Robert Kay added.

As explained, the report will help ports accelerate their GHG emissions reductions, decrease social and environmental impacts to local communities, expand investment and business opportunities, improve climate and supply chain resilience and increase competitiveness for government funding.",safety4sea.com,news,SAFETY4SEA,Katerina Tsiakaraki,0.4666666666666666,448726425,1,https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/decarbonization-shutterstock_1992556796-e1635320502989.jpg,

Julie Taylor - the grieving grandmother of 19-year-old Liam Taylor - has raised more than £37,000 as she devotes her life to preventing other families from suffering the same tragic loss as hers. Liam was stabbed multiple times outside a pub in Writtle in January 2020 and died instantly.

Julie set up the Liam Taylor Legacy crowdfunding page and provided lifesaving catastrophic bleed kits to as many venues in Essex as possible. She has already distributed about 180 of the special kits across Essex - and another 70 in other places across the UK.

Essex County Council has now pledged another 60 of the public-access specialist first aid kits - carried by Army and air ambulance crews - which include large ""plasters"" to seal the most severe stab wounds until help arrives. She said as well as town centre venues - so far venues including in Chelmsford, Braintree, Basildon, Billericay and Maldon and Witham have been given the £100 kits.

But remote locations are also being covered. They are not just for knife attacks but can be used for serious road traffic collisions that may result in a life-threatening bleed. Julie said: ""We are going into the country pubs as well. I've got about 13 in Uttlesford. Being out in the sticks means it's further for the ambulance to travel. It just makes sense.

""They need to be everywhere. You can die of a catastrophic bleed in three minutes. You are not going to get anyone out in that time. Five minutes is the maximum. I think every premise should have them. They are for any catastrophic bleed. There could be a major accident outside. If there are on site everywhere you can't go wrong.

""I've got them in churches. They said they are prepared to use them. Anywhere that asked me I'll just take one along.""

Julie recalled how she was just going to bed when she received a hysterical phone call from her daughter, screaming: ""He has been stabbed. He's dead. He's been murdered.""

She said: ""I am still in shock today and he has been gone for three and a half years. I watched his murder on CCTV in court. Liam was outside the pub in the smoking area with his best friend when the car pulled in. It took 39 seconds for them to drive in. The attack lasted for 13 seconds. Liam was stabbed six times, twice through the heart, and twice through the lower back, damaging his lung and liver. On top of that, he had 28 separate injuries.

""All I could think was how terrified he was. The perpetrators may be in prison, but we as a family are serving a life sentence. It has broken our family. I am nearly 60 and have lived three of his lives. I am never going to see him get married, he will never give me great-grandchildren.""

Julie, who now helps to train family liaison officers as a result of her experience, said: ""Me being here is keeping Liam's memory alive.""

A statement as part of a decision set to be made by Essex County Council deputy leader Councillor Louise McKinlay, said: ""Bleed control bags are portable kits containing specialist equipment that can be used in the event of an accident or injury leading to a catastrophic bleed and are used to stem the blood loss until professional medical assistance can arrive on the scene.

""The kits have received increased public attention for helping victims of knife crime and violent crime but can also be used to address a range of other causes of injuries in public such as vehicle accidents or severe falls that lead to heavy bleeding.

""Each kit costs £100 with funding made available to provide five kits per district council area, to complement kits already available in priority areas. Identification of suitable locations in our communities and supply of kits will be undertaken by The Liam Taylor Legacy, a local charity established by the family of Liam Taylor who lost his life to knife crime in 2020. Funding will be made as a one-off payment to The Liam Taylor Legacy Charity.""",essexlive.news,news,Essex Live,Piers Meyler,-0.3098039215686275,448726322,1,https://i2-prod.essexlive.news/incoming/article8946855.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-29-at-120455jpeg.jpg,

Energy islands, also called microgrids, are an example of sustainability and self-consumption. Over the last few years, several countries - especially emerging powers - have tried to develop the largest and most massive ones, when the trend should be the opposite. This is the smallest (and most expensive) ever seen, and it will be in this rural American village.

The small town of Montezuma, Iowa is about to make history as the site of the smallest and most expensive microgrid in the United States. This innovative project will provide the 1,300 residents of this rural community with a self-sustaining power grid that can operate independently from the main electrical grid.

For Montezuma, this microgrid will bring free electricity, clean energy, and energy security. The $5 million microgrid project is a collaborative effort between Montezuma Municipal Electric Utility and researchers from Iowa State University.

Once operational in 2025, Montezuma will become the first town in rural America to successfully implement a microgrid for their electricity needs. This localized power grid will combine solar panels, battery storage and backup diesel generators to provide residents with uninterrupted electricity service.

The microgrid project planned in Montezuma, Iowa will be a historic partnership between academic researchers, the city, and utility providers. Iowa State University researchers have teamed up with the municipal Montezuma utilities to build a one-of-a-kind microgrid system for the town.

The project has received $4 million in funding from the National Science Foundation and an additional $600,000 from the Iowa Energy Center. This funding will be used for designing and constructing the microgrid over the next two years, according to official plans made public this year.

Researchers expect the microgrid to be operational by late 2024. The project timeline involves first designing and engineering the system this year. In 2023, construction will begin on integrating solar panels, battery storage, and advanced controls into Montezuma's grid.

Once complete in 2024, the microgrid will seamlessly provide reliable, sustainable power to the town's homes and businesses. This will be the first fully integrated microgrid in the state supplying a whole town.

The small town of Montezuma suffers from frequent power outages that can last for hours or even days at a time. These outages are caused by severe storms, ice, wind damage and other reliability issues with the traditional power grid infrastructure that serves the rural community.

Having an isolated microgrid will provide Montezuma with much greater energy resiliency and reliability. The microgrid's on-site power generation from solar panels and battery storage will allow the town to continue operating even if the main power grid goes down.

Homes and businesses will no longer have to suffer productivity losses and food spoilage when extended outages occur. Rather than just being passive consumers from the central power grid, the microgrid allows Montezuma to take control of its own electricity supply.

At this point, it is inevitable to wonder whether it is a good idea to develop such an expensive microgrid and locate it in a rural area. Shouldn't it be just the opposite, to centralize the points with the highest energy demand? We are waiting to find out how it will perform and, above all, what we can learn from such a proposal.",ecoticias.com,news,ECOticias.com,,0.2784313725490195,448726255,1,https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/microgrid-dynapower.com_.jpg,

Effective immediately, players will experience a seamless transition to Arbitrum's blockchain, enhancing the game through invisible wallets, high-speed signless transactions, and a dynamic mobile marketplace.

King of Destiny is an addition to the 'Luck-Battle' genre, and it draws inspiration from games like CoinMaster and MonopolyGo. Players embark on a journey to test their luck, conquer civilizations, construct mythical cities, and vanquish legendary monsters in pursuit of fame, fortune, and glory.

InfiniGods started in 2021 with the goal of bringing Web3 Mobile Gaming to the masses. Its founders are Damon Gura (ex-CEO DGN Games) and Owen O'Donoghue (ex-director of Gaming, Meta), and its team is comprised of Web3 veterans & ex-Scopely, Zynga & Machine Zone employees. The company has raised $16 million in equity across two financing rounds, and it has 15 employees.

King Of Destiny is inspired by ancient mythology and its beloved characters and myths. Players journey through historic pantheons and civilizations, meeting famous heroes such as Hercules, Ares, and Athena along the way. Using luck and cunning, they can battle monsters such as Cerberus, Hydra, and Grendel en route to fame, fortune, and glory. Players can choose to help or hinder each other along the way!

In terms of gameplay, King Of Destiny takes inspiration from popular ""luck battle"" titles MonopolyGo! and CoinMaster.

Gura said in a statement that Arbitrum's network and its community will help scale King of Destiny to a global audience.

""Arbitrum is the ideal network for King of Destiny,"" said Gura. ""Their low transaction costs, fast transaction speeds, and bustling community provide us with the environment and resources to scale King of Destiny while delivering a next-generation player experience through blockchain technology.""

With the integration of Arbitrum, King of Destiny introduces a host blockchain features, including the acquisition of Fate, a unique in-game currency. Through gameplay progression and competition, players can accumulate Fate, which can be stored in Piggy Banks, on-chain digital collectibles freely tradable on the marketplace. Moreover, Fate can be used to acquire rare Avatars through an exhilarating pack-opening experience, enriching the game's narrative and enhancing player engagement.

David Bolger, senior partnerships manager at Offchain Labs, said in a statement, ""With features like Fate and Piggy Banks, the team is showing how web3 technology can elevate gameplay and player experience. We're excited for the growing gaming community on Arbitrum to get their hands on KOD.""

The announcement coincides with InfiniGods' live demo showcase in collaboration with Arbitrum at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco.

The Arbitrum Foundation supports and nurtures the growth of the Arbitrum network and its community by providing secure scaling solutions for Ethereum. Arbitrum One, a leading Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution developed by Offchain Labs, offers ultra-fast, low-cost transactions with security derived from Ethereum through Optimistic Rollup technology. With over 2,000 DeFi and NFT projects live in the ecosystem, Arbitrum One is focused on decentralized finance and digital ownership.

Launched in August 2021, the Arbitrum One mainnet beta is EVM-compatible to the bytecode level and has 54%+ TVL in the L2 segment. In August 2022, Arbitrum One upgraded to the Nitro tech stack, enabling fraud proofs over the core engine of Geth compiled to WASM.

King Of Destiny and its ""Piggy Bank"" feature is the first step to revolutionizing how people play free-to-play mobile games. The InfiniGods' approach to off-chain to on-chain trading (virtual currency -- > NFT) hands over a slice of the game's economy to players and lets them freely trade consumables amongst one another.

This allows them to own and monetize their experience, if they so choose. InfiniGods (the developer) does not sell these assets or currencies directly; they're purely sourced from players. The Arbitrum blockchain validates these trades and guarantees transparent, seamless, trust-based transactions between players

Asked what is attractive about the blockchain, Arbitrum said the Arbitrum blockchain combines fast, seamless, low-cost transactions with the security of the Ethereum blockchain. We believe to help onboard the masses to Mobile Web3 Gaming the blockchain components should be as frictionless and invisible as possible to players -- and this is what Arbitrum specializes in. Transactions on Arbitrum typically cost <$.005/ea, which allows InfiniGods to sponsor these costs and hide them from players altogether.

Additionally, Arbitrum has a blossoming ecosystem with some of the top teams and games in emergent blockchain gaming, including Treasure, Proof Of Play, Pixel Vault, XAI, and more. InfiniGods is excited to build alongside these teams and utilize Arbitrum's collective network effects to accelerate user acquisition and adoption.",venturebeat.com,news,VentureBeat,Dean Takahashi,0.3019607843137255,448725930,1,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/King-Of-Destiny-Logo-Blue-Background.jpg?w=1200&strip=all,

Cupertino By Benzinga,"What Happened: Cramer thinks the antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against Apple will be on investors' minds for just one week.

By next week, investors will start thinking about Apple's Nvidia partnership, according to Cramer. Apple has teamed up with Nvidia to stream advanced 3D experiences from dedicated AI data centers around the world, directly to the Vision Pro.

""I warn people that one week from now you will not be thinking about US v. Apple and will be thinking about Vision Pro meets Nvidia Omniverse for the biggest enterprise stream Apple has developed.""

According to a live demonstration of the Nvidia Omniverse technology, the company showed off an interactive, physically accurate digital twin of a car being streamed in full fidelity to the Apple Vision Pro's high-resolution displays.

The demo featured a designer using a car configurator application developed by CGI studio Katana on the Omniverse platform.

This could eventually become the ""biggest"" enterprise revenue stream, according to Cramer.

On the other hand, Wedbush's Dan Ives also thinks that the risk to Apple's business model due to the DOJ case won't be significant.

""We do not expect any business model changes for now with DOJ case, but Apple clearly is going to have to find a way to eventually settle this case, pay a hefty fine, and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store down the road.""",uk.investing.com,news,Investing.com UK,,0.2470588235294118,448724841,1,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEHAH0WT_L.jpg,eng-9405599

Positive Zero will collaborate with Schneider Electric across microgrids, mobility, energy efficiency and sustainability.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates:- Schneider Electric, a global leader in energy management and automation, and Positive Zero, a decentralised decarbonisation infrastructure business headquartered in the UAE, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to drive the development of sustainable energy solutions. This collaborative effort aims to accelerate the adoption of clean energy technologies and propel the transition towards a net-zero future in the region.

As part of the agreement, Schneider Electric and Positive Zero will collaborate on various initiatives to advance decarbonization-as-service programs across the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman. This includes exploring synergies across distributed microgrid projects, clean mobility solutions, energy efficiency, and sustainability.

David Auriau, CEO and Co-founder of Positive Zero, said: ""Schneider Electric, one of the leading players worldwide, and Positive Zero are both positioned to address a new energy landscape, which is decentralized, flexible and connected. This collaboration represents a strategic alignment of our shared vision for decarbonization and sustainability. Positive Zero is dedicated to pioneering innovative solutions that contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable world, and our cooperation will accelerate this movement in the commercial and industrial sectors.""

Amel Chadli, President of Gulf Countries at Schneider Electric, stated: ""We are looking forward to the outcomes of this collaboration with Positive Zero. It underscores another important step for Schneider Electric's journey and commitment towards accelerating the energy transition in the region and empowering organizations and communities to embrace sustainable energy solutions.""

In December 2023, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, announced its commitment to invest $400 million in Positive Zero through a diversified infrastructure fund.

The opportunity for advancing comprehensive corporate sustainability programs in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is significant. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) October 2023 insight report, ""Closing the Climate Action Gap,"" only 12% of businesses in MENA have committed to net-zero targets and just 6% have published clear road maps to achieve those goals. The report asserts that the GCC countries have more resources and lower costs to reduce carbon emissions using energy efficiency and solar power solutions, giving the region significant advantages over comparable countries in North America and the European Union.

Meanwhile, a January 2024 report by SkyQuest Technology forecasts that the global Energy-as-a-Service market will exceed $112 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 9.1% between 2023-2030. This includes the adoption of distributed energy resources like off-grid solar power and mobile battery storage, microgrid technologies, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for predictive energy analytics, and other green and sustainable solutions.

Find out more about how we test.

While Mizuno has always had a knack of creating some beautiful compact irons, it has certainly upped its game of producing some of the best drivers, fairway woods and hybrids in recent years. While the ST-Z 230 hybrid was a thing of beauty, it appears Mizuno has refined that model in order to keep the same stunning aesthetics but improve performance with the new ST-Max 230 hybrid. Coming to retail at $250 (£279) Mizuno is bringing a product to the market that competes with the best golf hybrid clubs from a price point of view... but what about the performance?

Still compact and with a classic shape at address, Mizuno has set about to produce a hybrid that offers the best performance in a number of key areas. It is a larger head than the previous model, but is certainly not one of the largest on the market and will maintain its appeal to the more confident ball striker. The MAS1C steel face has been expanded by a larger Cortech Chamber on the sole than previous models to improve ball speed consistency, especially on mishits. But it is the change to the leading edge that I felt really enhanced my enjoyment and performance with the ST-Max 230 hybrid.

A Speed Bevel has been applied to the leading edge, making it far less aggressive than on the likes of the ST-Z 230 hybrid, and made striking the ball cleanly from tight lies on the fairway far easier. Striking long irons and hybrids purely from the fairway is a challenge to even the best players and so having additional help to be able to attack pins from range will be sure to inspire confidence to all levels of golfer and made the ST-Max 230 one of the easiest and most forgiving hybrids to hit alongside the likes of the Ping G430 and Callaway Paradym Ai-Smoke. While I can't categorically say this technology helped me from the first cut of rough, I did hit one of the cleanest fairway bunker shots I have ever hit with the ST-Max 230 thanks to that leading edge not digging into the sand, picking the ball off the top nicely.

The deeply positioned CG (Center of Gravity), made possible from the weight saving on the carbon crown, meant the ST-Max 230 hybrid produced an extremely high ball flight, perfect for hitting into long par fours or having a crack at a par-five green in two. This high spinning ball flight did see me lose a little yardage compared to some the market leaders in this category especially into the wind, but only by three to four yards on average. The 19° model I tested still saw carry distances reach 236 yards, which is more than healthy, while offering excellent forgiveness. It should be said that the stock UST Mamiya Linq shaft was probably a little soft for my particular swing speed, which would have exaggerated the height of the trajectory.

All in all the Mizuno ST-Max 230 is certainly a hybrid golfers looking to upgrade the top end of their bag should check out and consider. If you struggle with launch and spin, there weren't many better models I tested this year that will help you than the ST-Max 230. The adjustable hosel did mean you could knock some loft and spin off, so for those golfers who swing it slightly faster or want a touch more distance, this option undoubtedly enhances the overall versatility on offer from this club.",golfmonthly.com,news,Golf Monthly Magazine,,0.584313725490196,448724386,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jzAsZLpEWgR7oKUstP6Dk3-1200-80.jpg,

Opinions expressed are those of the author.

Dr. Davor Sutija is the CEO of NexWafe, a solar photovoltaic company establishing a new standard for the future of engineered green wafers.

The U.S. has seen an acceleration in the adoption of renewable energy, including solar, likely as a result of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. U.S. solar installations in 2023 reached around 33 gigawatts-direct current, a 55% increase over 2022, and forecasts continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. In addition to accelerating solar installations, a key U.S. strategy has been to re-shore the solar supply chain and decrease dependence on imported modules.

While the IRA legislation offers incentives for the re-shoring of the solar supply chain, I've noticed the majority of announcements have been for the final module assembly operation. Module assembly operations can typically be set up in less than nine months in a light industrial building with relatively low capex.

Yet, many of these operations rely on imported components, including the critical solar cell. The solar cell manufacturing operation requires more capital equipment and facility engineering work than the module assembly operation. However, the most capital and energy intensive steps are polysilicon refining, crystal growing and wafering, and currently most of the world's production is in China.

At the end of February 2024, several members of Congress requested the U.S. treasury focus on re-shoring these capital-intensive steps to address this dependency. The concern raised was that ""Treasury's current guidance is the equivalent of claiming an apple pie is American if the pie is baked in the U.S., but the apples and all other ingredients are from China."" The recommendation to the U.S. Treasury was that in order to qualify for the domestic content bonus, the module construction would need to include not only U.S. made solar cells but also to have cells manufactured with domestic polysilicon and wafers.

As we look to re-shore these critical energy and capital-intensive parts of silicon supply chain, it is important to do so in a way to improves the carbon footprint of these energy intensive industries.

We can consider that a solar module has embodied carbon. This is the greenhouse gasses emitted across the entire manufacturing process, from raw material extraction to wafer production to manufacturing the solar panels themselves contributing to the embodied carbon.

Simply put, embodied carbon is a carbon debt, with the credit provided by the planet, to whom the future debt must be paid. This is not just a concept as the embodied carbon of a solar panel can be quantified to determine how long it will take for a photovoltaic (PV) system to offset its embodied carbon and start yielding net-positive environmental benefits.

Generally, the lowest carbon PV module must operate for one year before it can be considered as carbon-neutral, while a monocrystalline module must potentially operate for three times as long. This required operating time is mainly dependent on the carbon impact of the power used for the most energy-intensive parts of the panel manufacturing, including panel components. We can think of the time taken to reach this carbon-neutral threshold as a ""return on impact.""

The concepts of ""carbon debt"" and ""return on impact"" are important, but it is still challenging for buyers to make informed choices on which panels to procure. Some organizations are beginning to address this, such as the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance (ULCSA), which is developing new industry standards that will help government agencies, educational institutions, the private sector and others find products that meet sufficient sustainability criteria. (Disclosure: My company is a member of the ULCSA).

Additionally, the Global Electronics Council has developed standards for PV in an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) process with a multistakeholder group comprised of industry experts, government officials, NGOs and academics. The standards align with the established Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT), a global standard and ecolabel that establishes life-cycle based ESG criteria and carbon footprint criteria for solar panels.

To reduce the carbon debt of traditional silicon based photovoltaic panels, companies are increasingly focusing on sustainable manufacturing practices and the development of more environmentally friendly processes. One way is by seeking an alternative approach to today's highly energy-intensive silicon wafer production process. Some companies in the industry, including mine, are working on manufacturing technologies that are less carbon-intensive.

Industry standards for sustainable low-carbon PV manufacturing are helping PV buyers better understand the carbon debt of solar panels on the market. An important consideration is ""end-of-life"" management. PV panels have a life span of around 30 years, and the industry is preparing for a future where recycling becomes essential. Some companies in the solar industry have already initiated take-back and recycling programs to manage panel end-of-life.

Advances in photovoltaic technology are accelerating the energy transition. The PV industry has historically been focused on improving the efficiency and costs of solar modules but is now increasingly focused on reducing the carbon debt of PV modules.

As a business leader, first and foremost it's critical to seek out ways your business can reduce its carbon footprint. When considering renewable energy options, the implementation costs and incentives are evolving rapidly, and, in some cases, significant rebates for install costs are possible.

In parallel, looking beyond the simple ROI and gathering information on where products are manufactured could lead to selecting solutions that support the domestic supply chain and are inherently more environmentally friendly. Products that meet certain environmental standards and certifications can help business leaders understand the embodied carbon debt of the products they are purchasing. Supporting environmental standards also sends a clear signal about the goal to improve sustainability, transparency and lower carbon footprints across the supply chain.

As PV industry leaders, we must remain mindful that it's not just about adopting green technologies; it's about ensuring that these technologies, when factoring the entire life cycle, contribute positively to our collective environmental goals.

Residents will be paid 3.3 per cent of annual interest on this new one-year GSN issue.

After renewal of GSN distribution this year, residents could purchase the eighth issue GSN on 4-18 March. The redemption of this issue will be on 19 March 2025. GSN are distributed via dealers selected by the Ministry of Finance - Swedbank and SEB banks.

During the aforementioned period, Swedbank concluded 136 agreements to purchase GSN in the amount of EUR 2.5 million, while SEB - 50 agreements for EUR 0.8 million.

Preliminary schedule for GSN issue foresees to distribute the ninth issue on 8-22 April to be redeemed on 23 April 2025. The schedule is updated on monthly basis and published on the website of the Ministry of Finance.

The GSN interest rates are set for each issue individually, taking into account the appropriate term average Government borrowing rate on behalf of the State. GSN interest rates are fixed no later than one working day before the start of placement of savings notes and published together with other GSN issue distribution terms and conditions on the website of the Ministry of Finance.

The GSNs are the Government securities to be purchased solely by natural persons. It is a safe investment that generates returns, similar to term deposits with a commercial bank, only in this case the residents would entrust their savings to the Government. In turn, the GSNs is an opportunity for the Government to form one more borrowing instrument - to borrow from residents directly and thus attract the residents' savings not invested elsewhere.

Anyone willing to purchase GSNs during their emission will be able to do so via the distributors chosen by the Ministry of Finance, Swedbank or SEB, on their online bank with a few clicks of buttons. SEB will make it possible to purchase GSNs in bank branches as well (more information is available here and here).

Solar photovoltaic systems are a climate-friendly way to provide much-needed energy. A German-Ghanaian research project has analysed key technical and socio-economic aspects.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) hybrid systems provide electricity by harvesting the sun's energy while having a battery or diesel generator as a backup. They can either be connected to the grid or serve as standalone systems. During the Covid-19 pandemic, such systems proved a good option to quickly electrify off-grid facilities and thus guarantee important services such as cooling for vaccine storage. Adequate healthcare generally requires reliable electricity for instruments and light, among other things.

The advantages of using solar energy to supply health facilities include crucial climate aspects. For example, solar PV systems can improve the resilience of health systems to climatic challenges such as extreme weather events which affect the conventional power supply. As solar PV systems increasingly replace diesel generators, they help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and improve the local environment.

Solar PV (hybrid) systems are increasingly applied across sub-Saharan Africa including in Ghana, where interest in new forms of renewable energy grew in the late 1970s and early 1980s, driven by severe drought and energy security crises (Pedersen 2022). First solar panels were funded through bilateral or multilateral donor structures and set up in religious missions.

However, in the following decades, solar energy was not prioritised, not least because oil and gas resources were discovered in Ghana. In 2021, solar energy accounted for less than one percent of Ghana's electricity mix which mostly relied on natural gas (62.6?%) and hydropower (34.1?%) according to data by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

From 2019 to 2023, the German-Ghanaian interdisciplinary research project EnerSHelF (Energy-Self-Sufficiency for Health Facilities in Ghana) has analysed both technical and socio-economic aspects to improve the dissemination of PV-based energy solutions for health facilities in Ghana. The results show that it is important to understand details of electricity demand and technical challenges as well as barriers perceived by health facility managers, government officials and public stakeholders. EnerSHelF has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

While most health facilities in Ghana are connected to the grid, reliable electricity supply remains a challenge. Not only can this be dangerous for patients - life-saving instruments can fail, for example - but it can also be a financial burden as blackouts can cause damage to medical equipment. Interviews with health facility managers as well as other data collected by EnerSHelF suggest that standalone solar PV systems can help bolster the reliability in electricity supply when they are combined with grid supply.

Even though solar PV has become cheaper, costs and lack of information are still major barriers which keep health facilities from adapting such systems. Solar PV hybrid systems are particularly expensive because they consist of various components like solar panels, a battery system, grid integration and a diesel generator.

To lower the costs, it can be advisable to cooperate with public initiatives for the installation of mini-grids. This reduces the costs of procuring the system and developing the technical capacity to operate it. A mini-grid functions as a single system which is not connected to a main power grid. It can be powered by one or more energy sources.

Technical equipment used in healthcare facilities is very sensitive. This is why planning a solar PV system requires an overview of the highest energy consumption during a day, the so-called load peaks. If these are not covered by the energy supply, instruments can be damaged, which can result in disrupted health services. Data collected by EnerSHelF in Ghana suggests that the maximum load can be almost twice as high as indicated by the national grid operator. It can also be useful to include the base load of the surrounding community into the planning to fully take advantage of the capacity of a solar PV system.

Other technical aspects include forecasts of solar irradiance and climatic conditions at a given place. The EnerSHelF team has carried out analyses in this field to be able to advise various stakeholders. It has also developed a web-map which practitioners and governmental stakeholders can use to explore optimised solar-mini-grids setups in off-grid or weak-grid areas in Ghana.

Moreover, one of the project partners developed a planning tool that helps with the dimensioning of PV-solar hybrid systems. The tool is publicly available and does not require technical expertise.

Ultimately, considerable political will is needed to further expand solar PV energy production in Ghana. If adequately planned, it can play a pivotal role in supplying health facilities with reliable and affordable electricity. It can strengthen the supply in both rural and urban areas and have a positive effect on the quality and distribution of health services in Ghana.

Which brings us to the question: do you need to flip a hybrid mattress?

For the most part, the answer is no. A hybrid mattress is one that includes layers of different materials (usually foams and springs). Few hybrid mattresses need to be flipped as these inner layers are designed to go one way up. Flipping a hybrid mattress will likely lead to an uncomfortable night, and might even damage your mattress. Only double-sided hybrid beds need to be flipped, and these are not very common

Mattress flipping is generally done to distribute pressure evenly across the bed, helping your best mattress stay supportive for longer. But even without flipping, a well-built hybrid mattress should last for seven to 10 years.

In this guide, we'll explore why you don't need to flip a hybrid mattress, and the rare exceptions to this rule. If you're still unsure about whether your hybrid bed should be flipped, either check the brand website, or any instructions that have been provided.

Many modern hybrids feature multiple different layers of materials. Generally, the softer, more cushioned materials go on the top (there might even be a pillow-top or Euro-top), while the sturdier layers are at the bottom to create structure and stability. If the mattress is flipped, you'll find yourself sleeping on the robust base, while the comfortable cushioning cradles your bed frame. The top side should be clearly labeled, but it you can't spot it, check out the brand website or look for an information leaflet in the delivery packaging.

With all that said, there are some hybrids bed that are designed to be flipped - for example the Layla Hybrid mattress. These generally have a stable layer at the core with a different firmness level either side. However, it's tricky to create two very distinct feels within one mattress, so the difference between the two is likely to be subtle. These flippable hybrids aren't hugely common, and it should be obvious when you purchase that that's what you're buying.",techradar.com,news,TechRadar,,0.04313725490196085,448722781,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYm82JsvrHHZpo8nbMX7a8-1200-80.jpg,eng-9410716

Cupertino - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA),"He says investors will think about this by next week and not the antitrust lawsuit reportedly in the works.Loading...Loading...

Jim Cramer thinks that Apple Inc.'s AAPL partnership with Nvidia Corp. NVDA for the Vision Pro mixed reality headset could dominate investors' minds by next week.

What Happened: Cramer thinks the antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against Apple will be on investors' minds for just one week.

By next week, investors will start thinking about Apple's Nvidia partnership, according to Cramer. Apple has teamed up with Nvidia to stream advanced 3D experiences from dedicated AI data centers around the world, directly to the Vision Pro.

""I warn people that one week from now you will not be thinking about US v. Apple and will be thinking about Vision Pro meets Nvidia Omniverse for the biggest enterprise stream Apple has developed.""

According to a live demonstration of the Nvidia Omniverse technology, the company showed off an interactive, physically accurate digital twin of a car being streamed in full fidelity to the Apple Vision Pro's high-resolution displays.

The demo featured a designer using a car configurator application developed by CGI studio Katana on the Omniverse platform.

This could eventually become the ""biggest"" enterprise revenue stream, according to Cramer.

On the other hand, Wedbush's Dan Ives also thinks that the risk to Apple's business model due to the DOJ case won't be significant.

""We do not expect any business model changes for now with DOJ case, but Apple clearly is going to have to find a way to eventually settle this case, pay a hefty fine, and ultimately find some compromise with developers on the App Store down the road.""

""Our Goat thesis unchanged.""

Why It Matters: The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly gearing up to file a lawsuit against Apple for its illegal iPhone dominance.

The lawsuit alleges that Cupertino violated antitrust laws by restricting hardware and software access to the iPhone from competitors.

This comes close on the heels of the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to open up iOS to allow for third-party app stores on the iPhone.

Apple was hit by a $1.95 billion fine in the EU in another antitrust case that was brought by Spotify Technology SA.

Additionally, this system is available as either an OpEx model with monthly, usage-based payment schedules, or an as-a-service model, which provides flexibility and scalability to satisfy a wide range of organizational objectives.

Maximum Density, Performance and Efficiency for Lowest TCO

The Scalar i7 RAPTOR is designed to deliver the maximum storage density, performance and efficiency available in the market, which translates to fewer libraries to purchase, install and maintain, thereby reducing capital and operational expenditures. The product optimizes data access time and delivers industry-leading performance by avoiding complex mechanical designs that require excessive tape swapping.

With fewer libraries required to achieve maximum storage capacity, the amount of expensive data center floorspace needed to house the system is greatly reduced. This means customers get access to a low-cost medium that now delivers even better total cost of ownership (TCO) due to the greater density, performance and storage efficiency offered in the Scalar i7 RAPTOR.

Ultimate Sustainability

Quantum is committed to sustainability, and the Scalar i7 RAPTOR is a testament to this commitment. Every aspect of the Scalar i7 RAPTOR is designed with the environment in mind. The product features the industry's lowest power consumption and employs sustainable materials and processes throughout its lifecycle, from manufacture to delivery to operation to maintenance to disposition. This reduces the environmental impact and helps organizations achieve their goals to reduce CO2 emissions.

Simplified Deployment and Maintenance

The practice of handing out condoms at the Olympics is not new. About 8,500 condoms were handed out during 1988 Seoul Olympics to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. However, this number has only increased over the years. At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, the organisers arranged 70,000 condoms, but they soon fell short and had to order an additional 20,000. In 2016 Rio Olympics, 450,000 male and female condoms were distributed, reported the Washington Post.

Even in Tokyo, despite the close contact ban, the organisers gave out 150,000 condoms, but told Reuters they were ""not for use at the athlete's village, but to have athletes take them back to their home countries to raise awareness"".

As per Sky News, the Olympics 2024 are encouraging athletes to mix with each other. ""It is very important that the conviviality here is something big,"" said Laurent Michaud. He also added, ""Working with the athletes commission, we wanted to create some places where the athletes would feel very enthusiastic and comfortable.""

The company, which unveiled the ID.4, expects the Indian passenger vehicles market to grow 5-7 per cent this year while it is targeting 10-15 per cent growth for itself.

""Our first step to the electrification journey in India begins with the ID.4...,"" Executive Director Sales International Operations, Volkswagen Passenger Cars Michael Mayer said here at the Volkswagen annual brand conference.

He said the ID.4 is being brought in as part of the company's global efforts of mass electrification.

It will be launched in the Indian market later this year.

Globally, VW is leading in the electrification journey, he said, adding, as part of the company's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement 2030, it is continuing efforts in various spheres, including the development of charging infrastructure that's key to acceptance of EVs, recycling of batteries, digitalisation and connectivity solutions.

The company is offering different products from ID.2 to ID.Buzz globally targeting several segments of customers, Mayer said, adding that globally, VW's electric vehicle (EV) sales grew 21 per cent at around 4 lakh units in 2023.

""This is not the end of the story. It is our goal to take this success to other markets,"" Mayer said.

However, he added, ""This would be a phased approach, wherein we will strengthen our current portfolio on the basis of brand positioning for the market."" ""India, needless to say, continues to be a key market for Volkswagen. India is a 4 million car market now and is expected to grow 5-7 per cent this year,"" he asserted.

The Indian automotive industry is now ranked third in the world even surpassing Japan, Mayer said, adding, ""Who would have thought it ten years back?"" He said VW is committed to the Indian market and the company will continue to introduce its premium products over the next few years.

Volkswagen Passenger Cars India Brand Director Ashish Gupta said the company's sales grew 8 per cent in 2023.

The company had sold around 44,000 units.

""Our target this year in 2024 is to increase it by 10-15 per cent,"" he added.

The company will continue to expand its sales and service network to tap opportunities coming from Tier II and Tier III cities.

He said the company is targeting to have a presence in 170 cities with 230 sales and pre-owned car touch points along with 150 service centres in 2024.

The move will provide Quickswap traders with access to liquidity sourced from Polygon zkEVM.

The integration of Orbs Liquidity Hub with Quickswap will enable onchain traders to enjoy deeper liquidity, allowing them to execute swaps with minimal slippage. The Liquidity Hub will also provide Polygon zkEVM users with reduced transaction fees, protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), transaction executions without gas fees, and a streamlined user interface.

By supplying a combination of on- and off-chain liquidity sources, the Liquidity Hub brings CEX-level liquidity to DEXs, resulting in an optimum user experience. Developed by layer 3 blockchain Orbs, the Liquidity Hub is fully decentralized and composable. This makes it suitable for integration into third-party protocols and networks.

The Liquidity Hub operates as layer 3 infrastructure that sits atop the AMM it is integrated with. As a result, users are no longer constrained by the liquidity that a particular DEX can offer. The Hub adds additional liquidity sources including third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using onchain liquidity such as AMM pools or their own private inventory.

Orbs Liquidity Hub is designed to obtain the best possible pricing. In the event of the Hub being unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the transaction will return to the AMM contract and execute as usual. This process is abstracted from the perspective of the end user, who can be assured of receiving the best possible price within the UI of the AMM they are accustomed to.

The integration of Orbs Liquidity Hub into Quickswap on Polygon zkEVM follows similar integrations by Quickswap on Polygon and THENA on BNB Chain. The Liquidity Hub provides vital infrastructure for EVM networks, allowing liquidity to be directed to where it's needed instantly, resulting in better pricing and enhanced user experience.

About Orbs

Orbs is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators. Orbs' decentralized execution layer operates between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, forming a tiered blockchain stack that avoids the need to move liquidity onto a new chain. In addition to developing best-in-class blockchain solutions, Orbs supports projects whose goals and values align with its vision for web3.

You sit high but have more than enough space to adjust to your ideal driving position, and all-round visibility is pretty good.

There's a 7.0in digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel or a larger 10.25in screen on the top two specification levels.

This sits alongside a 10.25in infotainment touchscreen, on which everything is logically laid out and the graphics are crisp enough - although Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard anyway.

Thankfully, the petrol Avenger is as spacious and practical as the EV. The centre console conceals a large storage area and the door pockets are large enough for your average drinks bottle. The extremely useful shelf in front of the passenger is still here too.

It's not quite as plush as the Kia Niro or the Hyundai Kona inside, but the Avenger has its own character, which many drivers might end up preferring.

Again, though, don't expect too much space in the rear, especially not behind a taller driver. And as the e-Hybrid's battery is positioned underneath the driver's seat, rear foot space is slightly impacted.

The boot is slightly larger than in the EV, measuring 380 litres instead of 355 litres.

Here's why it would make sense,"The electric Fiat 500 is still only a project. There are no electrified versions - it's batteries or nothing. But in the not-too-distant future, things could change, and not just a little. According to rumours gathered by Automotive News, Stellantis is considering offering a mild hybrid engine for the 500e, which would enable it to improve its lot and increase production at the Mirafiori plant.

According to the newspaper, the decision has not yet been made, but Fiat has contacted suppliers to assess the feasibility of swapping the powertrain.

The possible adoption of the mild hybrid engine by the Fiat 500e seems strange, but if we look at the sales and production figures, it would make perfect sense. Let's start with the figures: last year, the Fiat 500 hybrid sold over 100,000 units in Europe, while the 500e stopped at around 62,000.

Electricity is still not catching on in Europe and giving the electric Fiat 500 another chance could prove beneficial in terms of sales, as well as giving Mirafiori a boost.

Here's the second reason why it would make sense to (also) convert the 500e into a mild hybrid. The Turin plant has long been at the centre of political debate and produced 77,260 cars in 2023, less than the 90,000 Fiat had forecast. Unions fear that production will fall to 40,000 in 2024, with negative consequences for workers. The introduction of an engine appreciated by the market could increase this number to 175,000 per year (according to Automotive News), with numerous advantages.

Another reason to support this thesis is the imminent abandonment of the European market by the 500 mild hybrid. The little Fiat car is unlikely to be renewed, as was the case with the Fiat Panda (anticipated by the Pandina), and from 4 July 2024 it will no longer comply with the European regulation on mandatory technologies. It will remain on other markets, with production at the Tafraoui-Orano plant in Algeria. From the end of June, the Tychy plant in Poland will lose a historic model, but it is already working on the Jeep Avenger and the Fiat 600, while awaiting the arrival of the Alfa Romeo Milano.

With the adoption of the new engine, prices would fall considerably. The electric Fiat 500 costs around €30,000, the mild hybrid (4 cm shorter and less technological) €18,000. Switching to the electrified engine could reduce the list price of the 500e by a few thousand euros, to just over €20,000. More expensive than the current model, certainly, but with contents in line with those of the competition and more space on board.

The question is, would it be possible to transfer the mild hybrid engine to the electric Fiat 500? The answer came in 2020 directly from Olivier François (number one at Fiat) during the presentation of the 500e: ""Technically, the platform allows it, but for the moment we want to concentrate on electric power. The initial plan therefore already left the door open to the possibility of non-electric powertrains, in the hope that this would be enough to ensure the model's success. In fact, the powertrain of the 500e was designed before Stellantis was born, and is therefore not the CMP, but a derivative (with many significant modifications) of that of the classic 500.

It remains to be seen which mild-hybrid engine will fit under the bonnet. If we exclude the 1.5-litre of the Jeep Renegade, Compass and Alfa Romeo Tonale (too big for a car 3.63 metres long), we are left with either the 70 PS 1.0-litre of the current 500 hybrid, or the 100 PS 1.2-litre of the various Jeep Avengers, Fiat 600s and the new Lancia Ypsilon.

According to Automotive News, if the project is given the green light, it will take between 18 and 24 months to make the necessary changes to the car and the production line.",uk.motor1.com,news,Motor1.com,,0.1686274509803922,448717535,1,https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/wOArm/s3/500e-la-prima.jpg,eng-9411424

As India expands its solar power capacity, concerns are mounting around solar waste management.

A new study published on Wednesday (20 March) has warned that India has already generated about 100 kilotonnes (kt) of solar waste, which is expected to increase to 340 kt by 2030.

The analysis, titled ""Enabling a Circular Economy in India's Solar Industry - Assessing the Solar Waste Quantum,"" was conducted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW), a climate think tank.

Solar waste refers to both the waste generated during the cell- and module-manufacturing processes and waste from the field (project lifetime), according to the study.

The waste from the field involves three streams: modules damaged during transportation and handling; modules damaged from operational negligence or manufacturing defects arising during the project life, and modules that reach their end-of-life and are no longer usable.

The study focused solely on waste from the field (project lifetime) category and excluded waste generated during manufacturing.

India's installed solar capacity has grown 26 times in the last decade, reaching 73.32 GW in December 2023, and is expected to jump to 292 GW by 2030.

Based on this data, the study notes that by 2030, India's solar PV waste will increase more than threefold, to 334 kt. Around 67 per cent of this waste is expected to be generated in five states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.

Further, the cumulative waste from existing and new capacity (deployed between FY24 and FY30) will reach about 600 kt by 2030, according to the report. By 2050, it is projected to increase to about 19,000 kt, with 77 per cent of it generated from new capacities.

Calling for proactive measures through policies, the report argues for responsible handling of solar waste and leveraging the multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits that accompany it.

For example, the study notes that the 340 kt of waste expected to be produced by 2030 will likely contain a total of 32 kt of aluminum, 10.4 kt of silicon, and 12-18 tonnes of silver. It will also contain 16 tonnes of cadmium and tellurium each, and 190 tonnes of lead.

Many of these minerals, including silicon, copper, tellurium, and cadmium, have been classified as critical minerals by the Center. Recycling solar waste to recover these materials will reduce import dependency and enhance India's mineral security, according to the report.",swarajyamag.com,news,Swarajyamag,Amit Mishra,-0.3019607843137255,448716387,1,https://swarajya.gumlet.io/swarajya/2022-10/8ff7e69e-c0c4-46bc-b9b3-1ca2c3c8e62e/Modhera_solar_village_ISA.png,eng-9411893

Here, we present the first, global dataset of foraging sites for the seven sea turtle species, highlighting challenges related to the current protection coverage of these key habitats and their remote locations. The outputs of this study represent an opportunity for planners aiming to expand MPAs to 30% of the oceans in order to meet the global target of the Convention on Biological Diversity by 2030.

Oceans will experience novel or even completely alien temperature conditions in the future. Indeed, global warming accelerates the range shifts of marine species approximately ten times faster than terrestrial organisms. We revealed that more than two-thirds of the global coverage of sea turtles' foraging habitats will experience novel sea surface temperatures by the end of the century. The sea turtle species that forage in tropical areas, characterized by higher SSTs, are generally expected of being exposed to novel temperature conditions in the future. Still, many foraging grounds in subtropical areas are likely to be subjected to significant deviations in their current temperatures. In some cases, such as the foraging grounds of loggerhead turtles in northern sites of the Mediterranean, even moderate SST changes might be hard to counterbalance, as the land masses hinder a northward expansion of current distributions.

Sea turtles' body temperature is intrinsically influenced by ambient temperatures, making them susceptible to rapid climate change. Although their endothermic ability permits them to regulate their body temperature in cold water, often enabling them to forage in cool, prey-rich northern grounds, they have less thermal regulatory capacity in warmer water. To cope with increasing temperatures, species are forced to spatially shift their distributions to climatically more suitable habitats. In that context, hawksbills temporally migrated from existing foraging grounds to cooler and deeper regions to avoid extreme summer temperatures. Similarly, during an El Nino event in the eastern Pacific Ocean, olive ridley sea turtles responded to changing ocean temperatures by moving northward to forage in upwelling grounds. It has also been documented that loggerhead breeders shifted to cooler foraging grounds, as warmer oceans support lower productivity and prey abundance, which can have time-lagged effects on sea turtles breeding capacity during the following years. While physiological and behavioral mechanisms, such as diving in deeper waters, migration, nocturnal foraging, and dormancy or hibernation-like status may permit species to avoid adverse conditions, other characteristics, such as foraging site fidelity can amplify their exposure to climate change risks.

Climate change is actively restructuring and redistributing marine communities across trophic levels from producers to mega-consumers such as sea turtles. Species sensitivity to climate change can also be influenced by an animal's diet strategy, while the complex trophic relationships of the marine realm could affect prey availability or shortages in the future. In terms of dietary strategy, omnivorous species, like flatback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles, are probably less prone to prey shortages than species with narrow or specific diets, such as green turtles. Green turtles are highly dependent on seagrass pastures and are probably more sensitive to warming than carnivore species. Previous studies have predicted a significant habitat loss of seagrass under global warming pressure, especially in the central Indo-Pacific Ocean, where the green turtles' foraging hotspots will experience a completely alien climatic condition. Hawksbills also have narrow dietary preferences, being mainly spongivorous, which makes them particularly sensitive to direct and indirect climate change impacts. Although the responses of sponges to climate warming and related ocean acidification are still unclear, with possibly even positive effects, especially for phototrophic and bioeroding species, the complex interactions between prey availability and sea turtles' thermal tolerance will still be a limiting factor in habitat use and potential shifts.

Our study highlighted a significant gap in the protection of sea turtles foraging hotspots at the global scale, as less than 2% of the foraging grounds were completely covered by the current MPA network. As the majority of established MPAs are adjacent to the coastline, with only a few sites located outside the neritic zone in open sea habitats, it seems that foraging populations that depend on near coastal habitats might be better protected, while others that forage in distant habitats from the coastline can be considerably neglected. Indeed, our analysis showed that the main foraging areas of flatback and hawksbill turtles are located within the neritic zone, possibly justifying why they are relatively better included in existing MPA networks, while the percentages of foraging habitats under protection for the remaining species remain very low or null. However, considering that multiple foraging areas are situated at greater distances from the coast, and tend to expand as we move farther away, we underscore the importance of exploring ways to enhance our conservation efforts in the open ocean. Still, recognizing that many countries have implemented laws to safeguard sea turtles, it's important to acknowledge that populations still face increased mortality risks, such as bycatch or collisions with boats. Despite being protected in these countries, whether within a designated MPA or outside one, sea turtles remain vulnerable. While we appreciate the significance of MPAs in bolstering sea turtle protection, safeguarding this highly mobile species demands a more comprehensive conservation approach. Within this context, delineating key habitats spatially and designing important marine turtle areas becomes imperative.

The present analysis, by reviewing and mapping available information on tracked sea turtles and by providing a complete and exhaustive mapping of their foraging habitats at the global scale, offers a background for effectively considering critical sea turtles' hotspots, even in deep-sea habitats, in our conservation planning. Our findings could therefore serve as a first step to schedule conservation actions in light of the potential risk of global warming for foraging hotspots. Nevertheless, we emphasize the necessity of climate-smart systematic conservation planning for sea turtles at the global scale. This approach could allow for the incorporation of species complex biology, considering both terrestrial and marine habitats that sea turtles depend on, while accounting for the three-dimensional nature of the ocean environment.

Still, we caution that other significant foraging areas (e.g., ref. ) exist; nevertheless, the information regarding their distribution does not conform to the methodological criteria applied in this study. Also acknowledging that sea turtles are not tracked from every nesting site, and that individuals from the same nesting site might visit different foraging areas, it is important to expand our approach to include various sources of information. For example, aerial surveys and stranding data can help supplement tracking data to highlight key areas. We further want to emphasize that although our method provides a spatial delineation of key foraging areas, the precision of the derived locations relies heavily on the quality of the gathered data. Specifically, the accuracy of the digitalized foraging points used to identify these areas might fluctuate based on the accuracy of the source maps we employed. Hence, it is imperative for future research to prioritize the use of original tracking data, aiming to mitigate potential spatial biases as much as possible. Finally, the use of other than temperatures, climatic variables, and multiple climatic models could further enhance the outcomes of this study, providing a possible spectrum of climate risk scenarios and enabling further uncertainty analyses.

Our findings underline the need for coordinated, international efforts in upcoming marine conservation planning to align with the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity for 2030. We showed that the majority of sea turtles foraging hotspots, as important habitats that could host a high number of reproductive individuals, are spatially unprotected and largely exposed to ocean warming. Moreover, we highlight that one-third of these habitats are located on high seas, outside countries' exclusive economic zones, where meeting conservation targets and climate resilience becomes even more challenging. We conclude that failing to design and implement conservation plans that can effectively and strategically include climate-resilient areas, even in remote, high-seas habitats, may have detrimental effects on sea turtles at a global scale.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2078431372549019,448716050,1,https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42003-024-06013-y/MediaObjects/42003_2024_6013_Fig1_HTML.png,eng-9406042

Not being ""cost effective"" was the rationale put forth for its abandonment. The justification holds ground considering the state does not have the sufficient raw material (petroleum) to feed the proposed plant. Petroleum-based heavy oils such as diesel is required in an 'oil-based' thermal plant to generate electricity, of which it is inferred the state does not have potential long-term reserves. To sustain such a plant, a guaranteed and long term supply of fuel oil is a must. Experts say that Nagaland fails in this aspect implying the state would have had to import it from outside the state at high costs, if it did became operational. Experts are of the opinion that the import and transportation costs will be very high, impacting its economic viability. Furthermore, power generated from such a plant will be very expensive which ultimately would affect the consumers.

There is no denying the potentialities of hydro based projects. However, ""contrary to popular notion the state has very limited water resources for power generation"" stated a concept note on 'Nagaland Power sector Reforms & Restructuring the Joint Venture Route'. The state at present has four potential hydro based projects namely -- Tizu-Zungki (150 MW), Dikhu (120 MW), Yangyu (40 MW) and Doyang stage III (24 MW) reported as being under various stages of planning. ""If these projects"", the concept note stated, ""are taken up in similar pattern as Doyang Hydro Electric Project (DHEP), the peak demand of the state from the present 80 megawatts can never be met."" It is projected that the peak demand for power in the state will reach 200 megawatts by the year 2012.

Such a proposition the note assessed will make no significant impact on the current power scenario of the state ""neither will it bring any additional revenue to the state government"". Even if all the projects are executed under same pattern as DHEP, the state will get a maximum of 60 megawatts during the peak season and a minimum of 15 megawatts during the lean season, ""whereas"" the note cautioned ""all the available water resources would be exploited"" by then.

At such a juncture a coal based thermal plant for the immediate future is of utmost necessity and very feasible. The state, if experts in the field are to go by, has in abundance rich reserves of high grade coal. Expert members associated with Nagaland Geoscientist Association (NGA) states that Nagaland has ""inferred"" and potential coal reserves estimated at about 315 million tonnes. Unfortunately these are being exploited with no significant contribution to the state laments Mar Imchen former literary secretary of NGA. He states that if these reserves are harnessed in a scientific manner prospects of setting up of thermal plants fired on coal is very positive.

He banks on the ""high calorific"" output of coal found in the state with low ash residue. The only hitch being its high sulphur content. This he said can be taken care of by a process called ""desulphurization"" in scientific terminology. However, this is a very costly procedure hence not cost effective, suitable only for large sized plants. Instead he says we can opt for small sized plants with output of about 25-30 megawatts wherein the said process will not be required. According to studies Mon, Mokokchung, Longleng, Wokha and Tuensang have rich reserves of coal while Niuland area in Dimapur district is also assessed as having promising reserves. Setting up a chain of 25-30 megawatts output plants along these coal bearing belts of the state is very promising it is assessed. Because of the high calorific output of coal found in the state it is estimated only about 1.5 lac tonnes of coal per year will be required to feed one 25-30 megawatts thermal plant.

""And this is to be maintained for at least 25 years to make the project viable"" and profitable notes a 'Report on Coal Supply Agreement meeting with Coal-Miners of Nagaland' held in the month May. In the report the state Directorate of Geology & Mining indicates that coal mining is done by coal owners in their own ways without consulting the department.

However, this can be regulated with the 'Coal Mining Rule 2006' (which requires ""Prospecting Licence followed by Mining Lease, Mine plan approval and Mine Closure Plans etc"") having been formulated paving the way for an uninterrupted, sustainable and long term supply of raw materials.

These digital behemoths, repositories of vast knowledge, face a significant hurdle: staying current and accurate. Traditional methods of updating LLMs, such as retraining or fine-tuning, are resource-intensive and fraught with the risk of catastrophic forgetting, where new learning can obliterate valuable previously acquired information.

The crux of enhancing LLMs revolves around the dual needs of efficiently integrating new insights and correcting or discarding outdated or incorrect knowledge. Current approaches to model editing, tailored to address these needs, vary widely, from retraining with updated datasets to employing sophisticated editing techniques. Yet, these methods often need to be more laborious or risk the integrity of the model's learned information.

A team from IBM AI Research and Princeton University has introduced Larimar, an architecture that marks a paradigm shift in LLM enhancement. Named after a rare blue mineral, Larimar equips LLMs with a distributed episodic memory, enabling them to undergo dynamic, one-shot knowledge updates without requiring exhaustive retraining. This innovative approach draws inspiration from human cognitive processes, notably the ability to learn, update knowledge, and forget selectively.

Larimar's architecture stands out by allowing selective information updating and forgetting, akin to how the human brain manages knowledge. This capability is crucial for keeping LLMs relevant and unbiased in a rapidly evolving information landscape. Through an external memory module that interfaces with the LLM, Larimar facilitates swift and precise modifications to the model's knowledge base, showcasing a significant leap over existing methodologies in speed and accuracy.

Experimental results underscore Larimar's efficacy and efficiency. In knowledge editing tasks, Larimar matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of current leading methods. It demonstrated a remarkable speed advantage, achieving updates up to 10 times faster. Larimar proved its mettle in handling sequential edits and managing long input contexts, showcasing flexibility and generalizability across different scenarios.

Some key takeaways from the research include:

In conclusion, Larimar represents a significant stride in the ongoing effort to enhance LLMs. By addressing the key challenges of updating and editing model knowledge, Larimar offers a robust solution that promises to revolutionize the maintenance and improvement of LLMs post-deployment. Its ability to perform dynamic, one-shot updates and to forget selectively without exhaustive retraining marks a notable advance, potentially leading to LLMs that evolve in lockstep with the wealth of human knowledge, maintaining their relevance and accuracy over time.",marktechpost.com,news,MarkTechPost,Adnan Hassan,0.1450980392156862,448715632,1,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-8.51.55-PM.png,eng-9406581

The move will provide Quickswap traders with access to liquidity sourced from Polygon zkEVM.

The integration of Orbs Liquidity Hub with Quickswap will enable onchain traders to enjoy deeper liquidity, allowing them to execute swaps with minimal slippage. The Liquidity Hub will also provide Polygon zkEVM users with reduced transaction fees, protection against Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), transaction executions without gas fees, and a streamlined user interface.

By supplying a combination of on- and off-chain liquidity sources, the Liquidity Hub brings CEX-level liquidity to DEXs, resulting in an optimum user experience. Developed by layer 3 blockchain Orbs, the Liquidity Hub is fully decentralized and composable. This makes it suitable for integration into third-party protocols and networks.

The Liquidity Hub operates as layer 3 infrastructure that sits atop the AMM it is integrated with. As a result, users are no longer constrained by the liquidity that a particular DEX can offer. The Hub adds additional liquidity sources including third-party solvers who compete to fill swaps using onchain liquidity such as AMM pools or their own private inventory.

Orbs Liquidity Hub is designed to obtain the best possible pricing. In the event of the Hub being unable to execute the trade at a better price than the AMM, the transaction will return to the AMM contract and execute as usual. This process is abstracted from the perspective of the end user, who can be assured of receiving the best possible price within the UI of the AMM they are accustomed to.

The integration of Orbs Liquidity Hub into Quickswap on Polygon zkEVM follows similar integrations by Quickswap on Polygon and THENA on BNB Chain. The Liquidity Hub provides vital infrastructure for EVM networks, allowing liquidity to be directed to where it's needed instantly, resulting in better pricing and enhanced user experience.

About Orbs

Orbs is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators. Orbs' decentralized execution layer operates between existing L1/L2 solutions and the application layer, forming a tiered blockchain stack that avoids the need to move liquidity onto a new chain.

Although pricing in the UK hasn't been released yet, it is priced in Europe from €19,690. The Duster is available for the first time with electrified engines, both mild hybrid (also with all-wheel drive) and full hybrid.

The range of engines is very similar to that of the Suzuki S-Cross, which is also similar in size to the Duster. Here, then, is a face-off between the two compact SUVs.

With the new generation, the Dacia Duster does not gain in length, remaining at 4.34 metres. The styling, however, is completely new, more modern thanks to a redesigned and more muscular front end, complementing the full LED lights with the inverted Y design typical of the rest of the range. The plastic protectors along the profiles are still present, giving an off-road look, and the roof remains perfectly parallel to the ground so as not to steal space from the passenger compartment.

The Suzuki S-Cross has not succumbed to the SUV coupé trend either, and is only 4 cm shorter than its rival. It too features black plastic inserts on the wheel arches and side skirts, to underline the off-road vocation that has always been part of the company's DNA.

The biggest revolution in the Dacia Duster 2024 is to be found in the interior, which has been completely redesigned and is much more refined and technological. Even though the basic version, the Essential, has been stripped down to its bare essentials, with no central screen or digital instrumentation. This choice is in keeping with the company's tradition of offering what is truly essential, leaving out the superfluous, for the benefit of the sale price.

In the most luxurious versions, the digital instrumentation is displayed on a 7-inch screen, while in the centre, in a raised position, is a 10.1-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, including in wireless mode. Underneath are the physical buttons for the climate control, while the central tunnel houses the inductive charging plate for smartphones, the small selector for the wired transmission (for versions with automatic transmission) and various object holders.

Space is good; those sitting on the rear bench seat have the necessary centimetres for their head and legs and two USB type C sockets, but no air vents. The boot capacity has been increased from a minimum of 473 litres to a maximum of 1,373 litres.

Inside, the Suzuki S-Cross dispenses with digital instrumentation, while in the centre, still in a high position, is the 7"" or 9"" screen of the infotainment system, which is of course compatible with the various mirroring systems, even without the need for a cable.

At the bottom are the physical climate controls and a single USB type A socket. There is also no optional wireless smartphone charging compartment.

In terms of space, the Suzuki S-Cross replicates what we see on the Dacia Duster, and even tall passengers aren't short-changed when they sit in the back seat. On the contrary, the boot offers a capacity of between 430 and 1,265 litres.

With the new generation, the Dacia Duster 2024 adopts electrified engines for the first time: the 1.2-litre mild hybrid with 130 PS and the 1.6-litre full hybrid with 140 PS. The diesel has been dropped, while the 1.0-litre LPG has been confirmed. The 2024 Duster can also be fitted with all-wheel drive, coupled only to the 1.2-litre mild hybrid and the 6-speed manual gearbox.

LPG aside, the Suzuki S-Cross offers the same type of engines: a 1.4-litre mild hybrid with 130 PS and a 1.5-litre full hybrid with 115 PS, both of which can be coupled with real all-wheel drive, not 'hybrid': the combustion engine drives the rear wheels. Just like the Duster.

Prices for the Dacia Duster 2024 start at €19,690 for the Essentiel equipped with the 1.0-litre 100 PS LPG and rise to €28,100 for the Extreme and Journey equipped with the 1.6 full hybrid. As mentioned, the standard base version offers the bare essentials: 16-inch steel wheels, Eco-LED lights, black fixed roof bars, rear parking sensors, lane-keeping assistant, manual air conditioning, cruise control and a 3.5-inch trip computer. To get the digital instrumentation and central monitor, you have to go up a notch with the Expression, from €21,600.

The Suzuki S-Cross, meanwhile, has a list that soars with a base price of €23,660 (£26,099 in the UK) for the mild hybrid with 17-inch alloy wheels as standard, rear parking sensors, heated seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 7-inch central screen and various driver assistance systems.",uk.motor1.com,news,Motor1.com,,0.1294117647058823,448714884,1,https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/YA3GZl/s3/dacia-duster-2024-versus-suzuki-s-cross.jpg,

Protein quantification is an important first step in the subsequent processing of protein samples and involves their isolation, separation, and analysis. Various methods can be employed to measure protein concentration depending on the required accuracy, sensitivity, and purity of samples, and different detection techniques can be utilized, including colorimetric and fluorometric determination.1

Due to the growing demand for high-throughput protein quantification in diverse fields, including proteomics, drug discovery, and therapeutics, lab automation workflows for protein quantification have become more critical.

Automated processes enhance experiments' reliability, throughput, and efficacy while mitigating manual errors. Therefore, automating some of the well-established and commonly used colorimetric and protein-copper chelation methods (such as bicinchoninic acid (BCA), Bradford (Coomassie) and Lowry) could prove advantageous in protein quantification and analysis workflows.2

An automated BCA assay is presented here, enabled by integrating the Absorbance 96 Automate microplate reader into the epMotion® liquid handling system (LHS).

The performance of Absorbance 96 Automate is evaluated by comparing it with another benchtop microplate reader; results exhibit identical readouts with similar reproducibility and linearity, highlighting the efficacy and sensitivity of the Absorbance 96 Automate in conducting automated quantification.

A comparison of manual and automated workflows also showcases expedited procedural steps in the automated workflow solution, resulting in a substantial reduction in the overall time required to perform the entire assay.

BCA Automated workflow

Protein quantification was carried out using the PierceTM microplate BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following the manufacturer's protocol, an automated workflow was established combining the epBlue software and the epMotion® LHS.

The automated process measured absorbance readouts at 562 nm, facilitated by the on-deck integrated Absorbance 96 Automate. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard graph was constructed, incorporating seven data points in triplicates, and measurement of unknown samples (four replicates) was performed across four dilution ranges.

Results

In the comparative analysis, the BSA standard curve analysis was performed by measuring the absorbance of the standard protein samples at 562 nm (Absorbance 96 Automate) and 560 nm (GloMax® Discover). Results showed comparable optical density (OD) readouts with a high correlation (see Figure 1).

The subsequent examination and comparison of OD values from unknown protein samples also revealed similar results (Figure 1B), with a high correlation (R² = 0.9989) (Figure 1C). The findings confirm that the Absorbance 96 Automate shows similar reproducibility, linearity, and sensitivity within the dynamic range compared to the GloMax® microplate reader.

Figure 1. Comparative analysis utilizing Pierce™ Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit demonstrates similar OD values (A) for the BSA standard curve and unknown protein samples (B) for the Absorbance 96 Automate (OD measured at 562 nm) and the GloMax® Discover (OD measured at 560 nm). A significant correlation of the sample concentration was observed using both devices (C). Image Credit: Byonoy GmbH

It is important to emphasize that the Absorbance 96 Automate had a shorter readout time than the GloMax Discover® (2 seconds compared to 52 seconds), emphasizing its efficiency for rapid data acquisition.

To examine further the benefits of an automated workflow for a BCA assay, a comparative analysis was undertaken by comparing both automated and manual methods. Results demonstrate a substantial correlation of the sample concentration between the two methods (Figure 2), validating the efficient performance of the automated approach in comparison to the manual workflow.

Figure 2. OD readouts of unknown protein samples obtained through the epMotion® and manual workflow using Pierce™ Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit (A). A comparison shows a strong correlation of the sample concentration between both methods (B). Image Credit: Byonoy GmbH

When comparing the manual to the automated workflow, a significant decrease in the total analysis time was observed (90 compared to 71 minutes). The automated system also enabled direct plate reading without intervention, optimizing and saving user time during execution.

Conclusion

The results derived from the study highlight the efficacy of the Absorbance 96 Automate in conducting a BCA assay, demonstrating comparable readout sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility like other benchtop microplate readers.

By integrating the Absorbance 96 Automate with the epMotion® LHS, the automated workflow solution facilitates a higher throughput in protein analysis characterized by increased precision and speed than a manual system.

These principles shall be paired with other measures to ensure that equal opportunities are present for all employees within a signed entity.

Minister Farrugia Portelli praised this initiative while emphasizing the need to promote further inclusion in the workplace. She described how the workplace is where many people spend significant portions of their time at, and therefore, it is ""crucial"" to make sure that this environment is one that protects inclusion and equality through the daily culture and operations by which the company is run.

""I look forward to not only seeing more projects of this kind continue to come to life, but to see more companies and businesses of all sizes become signatories of this charter,"" said the Minister.

Parliamentary Secretary Rebecca Buttigieg said that this Charter, which was promised in the Government's election programme, is an addition alongside the numerous initiatives in favour of inclusion and diversity that are changing certain mentalities. After encouraging signatories to do their utmost to abide by these values, Buttigieg said that being a signatory of this Charter is an opportunity for participating entities to be part of a European platform that facilitates collaboration with signatories of similar charters in other European Union Member States.

The President of the voluntary organisation CORE Platform, Helga Ellul, remarked that ""Today marks an important step in our collective journey towards the creation of a more inclusive society, where every individual is valued and respected regardless of background, belief, or his abilities.""

""The Charter announced today embodies our commitment to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of our lives, whether in the workplace, in education, or in public spaces,"" Ellul concluded.",independent.com.mt,news,The Malta Independent Online,,0.192156862745098,448710423,1,https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=240046,

In a move to ensure advance notice with regard to forest fires and to keep track of and prevent negative human-animal interactions, the Coimbatore Forest Division has set up three thermal image cameras at a cost of ₹10 lakh each.

The Coimbatore Forest Division comprises the Boluvampatti, Madukkarai, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai, Mettuppalayam and Sirumugai forest ranges. Between 2021 and 2023, a report indicates, elephants strayed out of forests and into human habitations 9,028 times. There are also other issues: in the Madukkarai range for instance, elephants who ventured outside of forests and went across railway tracks have been run over by trains. To prevent this, an Artificial Intelligence system was recently established at a cost of ₹7.24 crores.

The three thermal image cameras have been set up at Marudhamalai near Subramaniawamy temple, near Thadagam Ponnuthu Amman temple and at Madukkarai near the Ulagambikai Amman temple. The cameras have been installed on tall tower that have a 360-degree view. Unlike regular cameras that can only photograph for a range of 100 to 150 meters, these thermal image cameras can record animal movement over a range of one km. The cameras are also equipped with wipers so they can work during the rains, and the towers are equipped with lightning arresters.

The cameras will photograph and videograph animal movements and send these images to the control room at the Divisional Forest Office. The staff at the Forest Office can, in turn, alert field staff to mitigate potential conflict situations.

The Forest division proposes to set up seven more such cameras by the end of this month.

Source: European Pravda with reference to the EC press service

Details: This communication is the first step towards the inevitable reforms of the EU to prepare it for enlargement, the Commission said.

The document looks at the implications of EU enlargement in four main areas - values, policies, budget and governance - and lays the groundwork for internal EU reform before the enlargement.

Apart from that, the European Commission seems to have removed Olivér Várhelyi, the Hungarian Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, from the development of this issue.

When presenting a new policy or legislative proposal, the EC usually quotes a statement from the rapporteur commissioner or several commissioners co-responsible for the subject, and this is the case this time.

However, despite the fact that the issue of enlargement generally falls within the competence of Commissioner Várhelyi, the European Commission's press release does not mention him, instead mentioning only Slovak Vice President Maroš Šefčovič, whose responsibilities include institutional relations in the EU and development forecasting.

""Enlargement is a geostrategic investment that increases the EU's political and economic weight on the world stage. It consolidates democracy across the continent and strengthens the competitiveness of the Single Market, for example, by reducing critical external dependence.

But in order to take full advantage of this geopolitical investment, both the EU and future member states need to be well prepared,"" Šefčovič said.

In the document, the Commission insists that states seeking accession must be well prepared, and the accession process must remain merit-based.

The Commission has advocated the gradual integration of candidate countries long before they join the EU. The enlargement process will offer ""candidate countries and potential candidates enhanced avenues for 'gradual integration' of enlargement countries into selected EU policies, already before their accession, by frontloading certain benefits and obligations of EU membership,"" the document says.

However, the Commission stresses that full membership will require ""full adherence to a single comprehensive set of rights and obligations"".

Among the proposed reforms, the Commission recommends moving from a unanimity requirement to a qualified majority vote in certain areas of foreign and security policy.

The Commission believes that ""EU's governance can be swiftly improved by using to the full the potential of the current Treaties, such as 'passerelle clauses' 2 allowing for a shift from unanimity to qualified majority voting within the Council in key areas"".

The document also emphasises that the EU must maintain unwavering respect for the EU's core values and continue to apply them when accepting new members.

With regard to the budget, the Commission points out that future EU spending programmes should be designed with enlargement in mind. At the same time, the exact financial implications of enlargement will primarily depend on its timing, angle and the outcome of the merit-based accession negotiations.

Background:

Some EU capitals were nervous about this document, as they did not want the enlargement issue to be given much attention before the European elections in June.",pravda.com.ua,news,��������� ������,,0.1215686274509804,448709417,1,https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/7/4/7447464_fb_image_eng_2024_03_21_11_15_06.jpg,eng-9410273

In the proposed bill, digital currency is defined within the definition section as follows: ""Digital currency should be understood as the digital currency issued by Nepal Rastra Bank.""

In proposing additional provisions within this section, the bill has incorporated clauses about the acceptance and disbursement of digital currency. This arrangement aims to facilitate the utilisation and advancement of digital currency.

As per the Ministry of Finance's statement, Nepal, like numerous other countries globally, is gearing up to introduce digital currency. Essential legal frameworks are being drafted for this purpose.

The use of the ""Pchelka"" in the conflict zone was reported by the Telegram channel ""Russian Engineer,"" which also shared footage of the drone in action.

""The enemy writes that this is our drone, the 'Pchelka,' which was spotted near Bachmut. It is a VTOL, a hybrid of an airplane and a quadcopter, equipped with an internal combustion engine and serves as a platform for launching copters without any catapults,"" the channel's author explained.

According to him, thanks to its unique feature, the ""Pchelka"" allows for an increased range of action for FPV drones, and the Russian Armed Forces have been using this UAV for quite some time now. It is noted that an increase in the number of ""Pchelka"" drones in service could enable regular attacks in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Previously, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, Mikhail Fedorov, stated that Ukraine could produce 2 million drones a year, but lacks the necessary funds for it.

Earlier, it was reported that officers from the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) who were involved in attacks on Belgorod were eliminated in Kharkiv.

Context:

In recent developments, the Russian Armed Forces have been utilizing the ""Pchelka"" drone in their operations against Ukrainian troops. The ""Pchelka"" is a hybrid drone that combines the features of an airplane and a quadcopter, earning it the nickname ""mother"" of UAVs. This drone has the ability to carry FPV drones, allowing for extended range and increased effectiveness in combat.

The use of the ""Pchelka"" drone was revealed by the Telegram channel ""Russian Engineer,"" which also shared footage of the drone in action. According to the channel's author, the drone is equipped with an internal combustion engine and serves as a platform for launching copters without the need for catapults. This unique feature gives the ""Pchelka"" an advantage in terms of range and operational capabilities.

The Russian Armed Forces have reportedly been using the ""Pchelka"" drone for an extended period of time, indicating their familiarity and experience with this technology. The potential increase in the number of ""Pchelka"" drones in service could pose a significant threat to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as it would allow for regular attacks in their rear areas.

It is worth noting that Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, Mikhail Fedorov, previously stated that Ukraine has the capacity to produce 2 million drones annually. However, the lack of financial resources has hindered the implementation of this production capability.

In a related development, officers from the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) who were involved in attacks on Belgorod have been eliminated in Kharkiv.

On the downside testers said ""slightly shrunken cargo area lacks underfloor storage, pity there's no plug-in-hybrid version.""

Marketer's pitch: ""The hybrid that gives you more.""

Reality: I found the CR-V Hybrid to be such a nice companion, that I became a little paranoid. What was I missing?

What's new: The CR-V adopted the tougher look of the Passport with the 2023 redesign.

Honda's spokesperson notes the vehicle is completely redesigned with increased space, comfort, and performance. New hybrid models also feature a sportier new hybrid system.

Competition: Kia Sportage, Hyundai Tucson, Ford Escape, Toyota Venza, Toyota RAV4.

Up to speed: The CR-V Hybrid features a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and two-motor hybrid-electric power train, creating 204 horses, a slight increase from previous models.

I put it on highways and hills, in many passing situations, and uphill entrance ramps, and I was never disappointed. It's not a neck snapper, but it's no slouch; those three added horses really shine through.

The CR-V is a testament to how 0-60 numbers often are not reflective of real-world driving feel. The hybrid gets to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds, according to Car and Driver, but its daily driving is so much sportier.

Of course, pulling into traffic in a hurry will be its Achilles heel, so if you find yourself having to zip onto the Schuylkill or Blue Route blindly with great frequency, maybe there's another choice. Among hybrid SUVs, there is little; all of those mentioned above have a similar 0-60 time.

Sadly, a plug-in version is not available, though a fuel cell version is in the works.

Shifty: Whenever I receive a Honda without a push-button gear selector, I'm overjoyed; I don't like the row of buttons. And this gearshift is a nice size and a good height with a solid feel.

With the CVT and the hybrid setup there are no real gears to select, because the continuously variable transmission by definition has no gears, but there are paddles for adding torque, and it has a distinct shifting feel as the CR-V accelerates.

On the road: The SUV slides through slaloms better than before. It feels sure-footed and confident, although in Normal mode I noticed it can be a little jittery while cornering at lively speeds in town. It almost feels like rather than a smooth steering control, there are distinct nodes where it catches while turning the wheel.

Driver's Seat: The CR-V Hybrid seat seemed ideal at first, but over time it revealed a very 1990s vibe, with a flattish bucket and not much grip. Bright side, people bothered by tight seat wings might find this to be just right.

The gauges are pure Honda, so they're easy to follow and adjust. The steering wheel controls also add to the user-friendly feel; setting cruise and adjusting the stereo are all nicely done.

Friends and stuff: Legroom for rear-seat passengers is spacious, and even the middle occupant doesn't have more than an inch or two of floor hump to suffer.

The rear seat is about as middle-of-the-road as the front. The seat back does adjust some, via the fold-down lever.

Cargo space is 39.3 cubic feet behind the rear seat and 76.5 when it's folded.

Play some tunes: The stereo is pretty good, but definitely hasn't achieved the playback that delighted me so much in the Odyssey. I was fine with it for a few days but then realized it really rings and sticks on the high notes, ruining the jangly guitars that Tom Petty fans love. I'd give it a B+.

I even tested some of the songs that had hidden instruments the Odyssey uncovered and ... nothing.

Operation is not bad, with a small dial for tuning and arrow buttons for moving around. The 9-inch touchscreen is a small throwback but functional.

Keeping warm and cool: The heater controls are easy to follow and check at a glance -- dials for temperature and another one for fan speed, with buttons for the air source and an easy clear display for checking.

Fuel economy: I averaged just under 33 mpg in mostly side roads around Chester County, not that delightfully awesome for a hybrid, but about par for the midsize hybrid SUV course. (The Sportage and the Venza hit 35-36 in Mr. Driver's Seat testing, but I'm no longer confident in my Hyundai Tucson 29 mpg report; let's figure it matches the CR-V.)

Where it's built: Alliston, Ontario

How it's built: The CR-V Hybrid gets middling predicted reliability from Consumer Reports, a 3 of 5.

In the end: If you can live with the stereo, the seats, and the fuel economy, the CR-V Hybrid really has a lot to offer, and is probably one of the nicest out on the road.

Though I'd be happy in the CR-V or the Sportage, I'd probably pay the freight for the Venza for the very nice surroundings.",inquirer.com,news,The Philadelphia Inquirer,Scott Sturgis,0.09019607843137245,448708203,1,https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/9lvUrE2XBPI4QJkyT46meKA_hBw=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/VNJIHPQ3KBD5XCTFULPZNFCM4U.jpg,

Here are 7 that will,"They may be more fuel efficient, but Consumer Reports points out that some hybrids take longer than others to lead to savings

No one likes paying for gas, but at the same time, not everyone is ready or in a position to go full-electric. Hybrids offer a tempting middle ground between gas-only and electric-only that promises better fuel economy without the need to find a spot to charge. Typically, though, you're paying more for the hybrid version, so there's no guarantee that you'll make your money back right out of the gate.

So from a financial perspective, which hybrids are worth buying, and which ones should you probably skip? Our friends at Consumer Reports recently published a list of the seven hybrids that should come with the quickest payoff, as well as three that take the longest. To get to their final ranking, they estimated $3.40 a gallon for regular and $4.20 for premium fuel, as well as yearly mileage of 12,000 miles.

Because of that, if you live somewhere with more expensive gas or drive more, your payoff period will be shorter than CR's estimate. Still, it should give you a good general idea of whether or not it's worth it to go with the hybrid version of any particular car. Let's take a look at what made the final list.",qz.com,news,Quartz,Collin Woodard,0.2392156862745098,448708129,1,"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/5302532242f0e1f8f12d4257b382f776.jpg",

The technologies, which can be integrated into existing wind turbine control systems, are aimed to address the two major issues identified with the rapid growth of wind farms globally - namely power system frequency control and forced oscillations, which can cause widespread disruption over entire power grids.

While details about the technologies are limited, patent applications have been filed and the University is seeking commercial partners for licensing, collaboration or co-development.

""With increasing high penetration of renewable energy generation moving towards 100%, exploitation of future control potential from wind turbines becomes inevitable,"" says Professor Xiao-Ping Zhang, chair in Electrical Power Systems at the University of Birmingham, who has led the development of the wind turbine control technologies.

EIB supports European wind manufacturing with €5 billion

""These two technologies make the most of this potential, to benefit both the grid and wind farm operators, and ultimately energy users who need an uninterrupted energy supply and hence bring significant added values to wind turbines and power grids.""

Grid frequency events are caused by shifts in supply and demand, with the frequency dropping with a potentially protracted settling process when demand exceeds supply.

The new method is designed to quicken this recovery and eliminate the risk of a frequency second dip, with minimal - less than 1% - loss of wind power capture.

In particular, the technology was developed for use in variable speed wind turbine systems, which have emerged as the dominant type and usually operate at maximum power point tracking mode to extract the greatest amount of energy and so do not regulate their active power to support the grid when its frequency deviates from its usual value.

The second technology addresses the issue of forced oscillations, which occur when external disturbances produce oscillations that are close or equal to the natural oscillations in a power system - in the context of wind farms triggered by factors such as wind shear, wind turbulence or upstream turbine wakes and in the context of power grids by malfunctioning equipment.

The new control system suppresses and isolates forced oscillations originating either from the grid or from the turbine itself by releasing or absorbing power that is opposite to the oscillating power.

A university statement says that both systems have been verified in simulations with a range of different wind scenarios.",powerengineeringint.com,news,Power Engineering International,Jonathan Spencer Jones,-0.01960784313725494,448704991,1,https://www.powerengineeringint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/wind-turbines-web.x5d22124c_01.jpg,eng-9405200

Designers fight for their artistic vision by making a compelling case to accountants - who must balance the books - and engineers who look after practical concerns.

Stylists clearly have a lot of sway at Toyota, because the new C-HR hybrid looks sensational.

From the supercar-like bonnet and headlights to its steeply raked windscreen, flush-mounted doorhandles and wiperless rear window, it looks like a concept car.

Check out the way ""Toyota C-HR"" is now embedded into the blade of light running across its rump, replacing old-school chrome badges in a nod to modernity.

Lots of cars have a wide-screen infotainment system and digital dashboard. Some have 64-colour LED ambient lighting in the cabin. Few sync the colour and brightness of the car's mood lighting to the time of day - warm and bright in the morning, cool and soothing at night.

Environmental concerns also held sway in the development process.

There are no animal products anywhere in the car - not in the leather-look seats, the hidden adhesives, or the insulation used to dampen vibrations.

The paint is now water based. The amount of recycled plastic used throughout the car has doubled, reducing reliance on new petrochemical products.

The hybrid battery swaps nickel metal hydride chemistry for greener lithium ion technology.

These are all good things. They are also expensive, which is why the Toyota C-HR GR Sport shown here costs about $61,000 drive-away. That's a lot for a little SUV. A hell of a lot.

Toyota defends its price strategy by claiming expensive tech such as pedestrian detection, driver monitoring and fuel-saving hybrid systems are pretty much mandatory for new cars.

Ever stricter safety requirements pushed the C-HR's airbag count into double digits with the addition of a 10th unit placed between the driver and front passenger.

The cabin has more features than before, but feels surprisingly snug for a new model. It's decent from a driver's perspective, but passengers are hemmed in by a deeply sculpted dashboard and upswept window line.

There are no air vents or power outlets in the rear of cheaper models, and no rear armrest at any level in the price range. Score a point for the bean counters. Designers returned serve with a shapely rear that has no space for a spare tyre, and not much in the way of cargo room.

Engineers won their way in this GR Sport by fitting a sophisticated all-wheel-drive hybrid system that combines a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with electric motors in the front and rear.

As in the larger RAV4 Hybrid, there is no physical link from the engine to the back wheels, which are driven only by an electric motor.

The combination uses 4.1L/100km to deliver 146kw of combined power - strong numbers for performance and efficiency.

Cheaper models priced from about $48,000 drive-away make do with a less powerful 1.8-litre hybrid that uses 4.0L/100km to make 103kW of combined power. Both engines are linked to CVT automatic transmissions.

The smaller engine gets the job done without feeling impressive. It's a noisy unit compared to turbo petrol rivals, but you'll struggle to match its efficiency in rival metal.

The GR Sport is a better bet.

Quieter, thanks to its extra hybrid oomph and a bigger engine that requires fewer revs, it's a smooth unit that delivers easy progress.

Toyota's mastery of the hybrid art results in seamless responses from the brake system, meshing nicely with sweet steering to deliver a satisfying drive.

Low-profile tyres on the 19-inch rims of the GR Sport return a ride that can be unsettled over big bumps that ask difficult questions of its suspension.

There are more polished performers at this price - particularly if you consider a switch to zippy electric cars.

The overall driving experience is good but not great, and the dollars involved don't result in a bargain buy. After all, the designers won this war.

VERDICT 3.5/5

Head-turning looks and impressive hybrid efficiency are undermined by a high price and middle-of-the-road drive.

(Representational image)

After browsing the vehicle lot for at least a year, President Joe Biden has plumped for the hybrid. New tailpipe emissions standards announced Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency represent an attempt to balance climate imperatives with consumer preferences, technological stretch goals with industrial capabilities, and, perhaps most acutely, the environmental and labour wings of Democrats.

When the EPA issued the proposed standards almost a year ago in April in a push toward a rapid electrification of passenger vehicles, they drew the expected criticism from Republicans and oil industry-linked interests. But they also received a cautious response from legacy automobile manufacturers and the United Auto Workers union, which feared a dash for electric vehicles was beyond Detroit's current capabilities and would result in factories being shuttered.

Time has only lent weight to the arguments made by the critics in Detroit and at the UAW. Both General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co have stumbled in their EV efforts, with Ford's newly segmented financial results showing it lost an average of more than $40,000 on each EV sold in 2023. Both have reset growth targets for battery-based vehicles and talked-up prospects for plug-in hybrids as an alternative. Growth in EV sales overall has slowed, prompting price cuts that have hit even industry leader Tesla Inc. In the fall, when the UAW staged a successful strike, its pugnacious leader Shawn Fain made no secret of his unease about what electrification might mean for the union, and notably withheld public support for Biden's re-election efforts for months.

The EPA's final rule now hews toward the less strict alternatives outlined in April's proposal, resulting in emissions-per-mile targets falling 49 percent by 2032 rather than 56 percent. More importantly, the trajectory for tightening is flatter, requiring cuts later rather than sooner, therefore giving auto manufacturers more breathing room through the late 2020s.

Whereas the headline for April's proposal, embraced by the EPA in its own announcement, was that battery vehicles' share of sales could rise to 67 percent in 2032 under the new standards, the final rule points to a range of potential, and less ambitious, scenarios to meet the new goals. Most notably, while the central case sees battery EVs taking 56 percent of the market in 2032, the EPA also lays out an alternative pathway where they take only 35 percent, with plug-in hybrids rising to 36 percent.

Suggesting a viable, and potentially thriving, future for hybrids isn't just designed to ease Detroit's fears (Tesla won't necessarily like it but maybe Biden thinks the company's leader is a lost cause for Democrats anyway). The White House likely has the Supreme Court in mind, too. As the 2022 ruling against the Clean Power Plan showed, the court's right-wing majority is gunning against regulatory deference to agencies, especially on vaguely defined ""major questions"" of policy. Just as revised power-plant emissions rules announced last May eschewed prescriptions of how utilities met tighter standards, so the EPA is at pains to show it isn't dictating how manufacturers meet these new tailpipe targets.

Those power-plant rules recognised that keeping the grid reliable as it greens meant giving ground to natural gas plants, which are the main sources of backup for wind and solar for the foreseeable future. Similarly, tailpipe standards that leave more room for hybrids allows the country to leverage existing technology -- the humble gas station -- while mitigating vehicle emissions until battery EVs are cheap and desirable enough to fully supplant the internal combustion engine.

Such practicalities, while unlikely to win Biden plaudits from either end of the political spectrum, are aimed at the potentially persuadable middle. Wednesday's announcement highlighted backing from environmentalists, trade associations and the UAW. The project of energy transition in the US has always been less about specific targets for this or that year in the future and more about maintaining the momentum required to invest in cleaner technologies, especially the supply chain that builds them. A US vehicle market in which EVs are ""only"" a third or half of sales would still be a market transformed and ripe for further transformation.

That momentum faces its biggest potential crash barrier this coming November, with the road running straight through states like Michigan. Apart from anything else, this hybrid is designed to avoid any skidding.",moneycontrol.com,news,MoneyControl,,-0.04313725490196074,448696854,1,https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2018/09/Tesla-Model-3-770x435.jpg,eng-9411264

The refusal of the plans was made due to 'planning matters raised by the community, regarding the potential for adverse impacts on the amenity of local residents, risk to employee and public safety in relation to the turbine being within topple distance of the factory and ecological impacts on protected species' with councillors saying the application had not alleviated local community concerns in order to enable community support of the scheme.

At the meeting in August last year, Seaton councillor, Jimmy Grisdale claimed there was 'a danger of the turbine toppling over' and he moved that they reject the application quoting various planning policies to support going against the officer's recommendation to approve the plan.

He said: ""This will affect the local community.""

The company re-submitted the plans on March 14, saying there is a business need to build the turbine which will 'generate enough energy to meet 100 per cent of the factory demand on site', with rooftop solar already providing approximately 30 per cent of the electricity at the Flimby factory.

It has also submitted an appeal to the Secretary of State alongside this resubmission.

The company has said that there the application is a commitment to the site at Flimby, which employs over 300 people in the community.

Documents supporting the application said: ""As a business New Balance takes its climate responsibilities very seriously and has committed through RE1003 Climate Group to sourcing 100 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025 across all global New Balance operations.

""Any excess power would ideally be 'passed through' to the Warrington head office and retail sites.

""This investment demonstrates New Balance's ongoing commitment to the Flimby site and its sustainability.""

However, some unexpected hurdles have reportedly prompted the brand to delay the debut of the planned EV model.

Announcing the delay, Bentley CEO Adrian Hallmark cited technical glitches stemming from software issues and platform-related concerns as the main culprits behind the setback. Consequently, Bentley aficionados will have to show patience as the anticipated EV's unveiling has been postponed to late 2026, with customer deliveries expected to start sometime in 2027.

In tandem with the postponement of their EV debut, the auto brand has re-adjusted its timeline for achieving complete electrification. Initially targeting a gasoline-free lineup by the end of 2030, the British luxury brand has pushed back the deadline to 2033. This strategic adjustment affords the brand a three-year window to bolster investments in plug-in hybrids, which is expected to facilitate a smoother transition towards an all-electric future. The decision underscores the automaker's commitment to systematic progression in embracing sustainable mobility solutions.

Bentley's inaugural EV, which will be built in the U.K., will ride on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), an innovative platform created by Porsche in collaboration with Audi. While sharing technological foundations with sibling brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella, the brand's foray into electrification promises to carve its own niche within the EV landscape.

When Bentley's long-awaited EV will finally grace the market, it promises a blend of lavishness and eco-conscious performance. With projections of remarkable range and quick charging capabilities, Bentley's EV endeavors signify a paradigm shift towards sustainable luxury.

As Bentley navigates the intricacies of electrification, enthusiasts can anticipate the introduction of a powerful V8 plug-in hybrid setup across select models later this year. In the meantime, the brand's widely-admired Bentayga SUV will retain its gasoline powertrain until 2026, marking a transitional phase towards an electric-only future.

Amidst these transitions, Bentley's sales scene remains largely dominated by the Bentayga, indicating continued consumer affinity for the luxury brand's SUV offerings. Despite facing several challenges, the brand's steadfast commitment to luxury sustainability reaffirms its position as a frontrunner in the evolution of premium automotive experiences. As the luxury automaker embarks on its electric odyssey, the journey towards a greener future is laden with promise and innovation, cementing the brand's lasting influence in the history of the automotive industry.",topnews.in,news,topnews.in,,0.06666666666666665,448694969,1,,eng-9406668

The result is a fuel-flexible solution for commercial and industrial customers looking to decarbonize.

A microgrid is a self-contained electrical network that generates electricity on site by a fuel source such as solar and stored for when it is needed most. The microgrid can be connected to the power grid or can decentralize and ""island"" when needed. The ability to decentralize power ensures that critical facilities, such as data centers or healthcare facilities, have electricity to power critical operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They can also be used in remote areas where energy access is limited or nonexistent to provide much-needed resources.

As part of Schneider Electric's cybersecure solution architecture, EcoStruxure Microgrid Operations is a dedicated, packaged microgrid controller solution. The hardware and software solution offers streamlined operator experience, advanced distributed energy resource management, advanced grid management, and more, according to Schneider Electric.

The Mainspring Linear Generator was launched commercially in 2020 and the company reports it is installed today in multiple regions of the U.S., running operations for Fortune 500 companies.

These generators use a low-temperature reaction of fuel and air to create electricity, continuously. When used in conjunction with solar modules, the generators can ensure optimal use of the sun's energy at all times. The Mainspring generator also lets customers switch among multiple fuel options, including renewable options such as biofuels, green ammonia and green hydrogen.

To significantly improve the prediction accuracy of short-term PV output power, this paper proposes a short-term PV power forecasting method based on a hybrid model of temporal convolutional networks and gated recurrent units with an efficient channel attention network (TCN-ECANet-GRU) using the generated data of an Australian PV power station as the research object. First, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) are used as spatial feature extraction layers, and an efficient channel attention network (ECANet) is embedded to enhance the feature capture capability of the convolutional network. Then, the GRU is used to extract the timing information for the final prediction. Finally, based on the experimental validation, the TCN-ECANet-GRU method generally outperformed the other baseline models in all four seasons of the year according to three performance assessment metrics: the normalized root mean square error (RMSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The best RMSE, MAE and R2 reached 0.0195, 0.0128 and 99.72%, respectively, with maximum improvements of 11.32%, 8.57% and 0.38%, respectively, over those of the suboptimal model. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper is effective at improving prediction accuracy. Using the proposed method, this paper concludes with multistep predictions of 3, 6, and 9 steps, which also indicates that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other models.

Along with the escalating conflict between environmental protection and growing energy demand, clean energy is gradually gaining worldwide attention. Among them, photovoltaic power generation, as a type of clean energy, is constantly being popularly used due to its advantages, such as safety, extensiveness, sufficiency, and potential economy. However, photovoltaic power generation is susceptible to intermittent and unstable power generation due to factors such as climatic features and the alternation of day and night, which leads to difficulties in matching the demand and supply to the grid and poses certain scheduling challenges for the power system. Short-term forecasting of PV power, therefore, contributes to timely coordination of the power system, reduces the impact of fluctuations in PV power on the grid, and provides the basis for a continuous and stable power supply and demand.

At present, photovoltaic power generation forecasting methods can be roughly divided into statistical methods, traditional machine learning methods, and deep learning methods. Statistical methods include linear regression, ARMA time series analysis, and the Markov chain model. Although the statistical methods are highly explanatory, the model is complex when considering the many influencing factors, which is not conducive to practical forecasting and often results in large prediction errors when dealing with sudden changes in PV power.

Machine learning methods include a probabilistic neural network (PNN) used to divide subsets of different weather types, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and support vector regression (SVR) optimized by the scattered search algorithm (SS) to forecast the short-term output of PV power generation, as proposed by Wang Xin et al.. Song et al. proposed a combined prediction model consisting of multiple regression trees, which possesses good prediction performance compared with a variety of traditional methods. Wang et al. used a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to train on historical weather data and historical power generation data, and the resulting prediction models had the advantages of strong interpretability and stable error performance. Massaoudi M et al. performed feature selection based on Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), decomposed the feature data using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and finally predicted PV power generation via the CatBoost algorithm. CatBoosting performed well for categorical feature processing, and the model performed better in terms of the coefficient of determination and actual error. Traditional machine learning methods often require manual feature extraction to obtain good results before work, but it is difficult to ensure the versatility of feature extraction in the early stage when facing complex problems. Mahmud et al. tried to provide and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in short-term power generation prediction and long-term prediction of PVs. Mas'ud compared the performances of KNN, MLR and decision tree regression (DTR) in predicting the hourly PV output power in Saudi Arabia and concluded that KNN is the best.

The deep learning methods applied for photovoltaic power generation forecasting include BP, LSTM, GRU, and Elman neural networks. Zhang et al. used a 3-layer BP neural network to learn from historical data, and the model's predictions were highly accurate. Zhang et al. classified the dataset by day type and built an Elman neural network to predict PV power generation. The model has a faster calculation speed and higher prediction accuracy than does the FNN. In 2015, Ye et al. fed historical power generation, solar radiation intensity, and temperature data into a GA algorithm-optimized fuzzy radial basis function network (RBF) to predict power generation. Hossain and Mahmood mainly discussed the effect of different input sequence lengths on the performance of single-step prediction models. Considering the characteristics of wind speed, module temperature, ambient and solar radiation, Akhter et al. constructed an RNN-LSTM model to predict PV power generation for the next 1 h using data from three different PV power stations with a temporal resolution of 5 min. Li et al. combined wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to decompose photoelectric sequences into multiple stable subsequences; subsequently, the sequences were fed into LSTM for parallel prediction; the respective outputs were linearly weighted to obtain the final predicted values; this approach outperformed the MLP and RNN methods in terms of MBE, MAPE, and RMSE performance metrics. Bi et al. proposed a PCNN-BiLSTM model based on CEEMDAN, SSD, and VMD for use as a PV power prediction model; additionally, the decomposed subsequences were fed into parallel convolutional networks and BiLSTM to learn the features; this method ultimately led to improved prediction performance. Yan et al. utilized frequency domain decomposition and a CNN to extract features and predictions, and the experiments proved that compared with RNNs and long short-term memory (LSTM), CNNs have a significant advantage in terms of time efficiency. Zhou et al. introduced CEEMDAN signal decomposition and the multiobjective chameleon swarm algorithm to optimize different deep learning methods and investigate the prediction performance of multiple methods on different PV datasets. Zhou et al. entered separate LSTMs for meteorological and photovoltaic data for prediction and assigned different weights to the data at different time steps via an attention mechanism to focus adaptively on important information; subsequently, the outputs were processed by the flattening layer and combined to obtain the predicted values. The model performed stably in comparison with the ARIMAX and traditional LSTM models for different seasons and time steps.

In recent years, due to the complexity of time series and the limitations of single models, hybrid models that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks, such as CNN-LSTM, LSTM-CNN and CNN-GRU, have been widely used; all of these models have good capabilities for PV power forecasting, where the CNN is used mainly for feature extraction of all the attributes and the LSTM and GRU are used for processing features for forecasting. However, ordinary convolutional networks require deeper layers when capturing information over long periods due to the constant size of the convolutional kernel, which tends to cause problems such as gradient disappearance and can directly affect the prediction results. Therefore, Bai et al. proposed the temporal convolutional network (TCN) in 2017. TCNs can process multiple time series of information in parallel and reduce the consumption of computational resources compared to CNNs and recurrent neural networks.

In this paper, a TCN is used to extract the temporal and correlation information of features. Although the TCN itself has a large receptive field, it is still limited by its convolution kernel size, and the efficient channel attention (ECANet) mechanism is embedded to improve TCN performance. Based on this, this paper proposes a hybrid model of TCN-ECANet-GRU, which learns the spatial features of several historical weather variables and PV power sequences via the improved TCN module of ECANet. Then, the GRU acquires the sequence of time features and establishes the relationship between the features and outputs to predict the PV power.

Speaking to the CERAWeek energy conference via video on Tuesday, Al Jaber said 52 international and national oil companies had already joined the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, representing 44% of oil production.

""This is major progress. But it is not enough,"" Al Jaber said, calling on other oil and gas firms to ""step up and sign up.""

Al Jaber's COP28 presidency announced the charter with Saudi Arabia in December during the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, where nearly 200 countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels.

CNPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously, CNPC said it aims for a peak in its carbon emissions by around 2025, reaching near-zero emissions by 2050, a decade ahead of China's carbon neutrality target of 2060.

Among the charter's signatories are BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Aramco and ADNOC, which Al Jaber leads as chief executive.

Climate activists had criticised the summit being held in the United Arab Emirates, a leading oil exporter and member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

Jaber, who also chairs UAE renewable energy firm Masdar, said his background in all forms of energy was ultimately beneficial.

But the firm said that, with the exception of last financial year, profitability per equity partner had been on a sustained upward trajectory and revenue growth was due to hit double-digits this year.

Baker McKenzie's Asia chief executive, Steven Sieker, travelled from Hong Kong to make a presentation to a partner retreat earlier this month about a proposal to move the Australian branch under the auspices of the global firm's Asian division, ending the local outfit's relative independence.

Such a move would see the firm take on a greater proportion of international work, and signal a shift away from originating its own billings in the Australian market.

Ms Allgrove said the firm ""has been on a journey of greater global alignment for several years and we are discussing the potential for further functional alignment with a view to improving efficiency"".

Ms Allgrove is currently in Hong Kong for further discussions on integration with the global firm.

Cost-cutting measures imposed by the global firm have hit back office functions, as part of an effort to make greater use of networked global resources.

Baker McKenzie's head of business development, Marleine Neilson, left the firm last month, following the departure of IT head Adam Cassar late last year.

Cuts had gone so far as to impact the number of biscuits served to clients, said the partner, who asked not to be identified.

Ms Allgrove said the firm regularly reviewed its cost base and had ""made some structural changes to some teams to align with business needs"".

More partners are expected to leave the firm in the coming months, tempted by the opportunity to earn more elsewhere.

""It's hard to retain people when you can get double what you're making elsewhere. Likewise, it's hard to attract good people,"" said the partner.

""Financial forecasts for this year are not much better [than last year]. People don't see a clear strategy for a turnaround, and they're voting with their feet.""

In contrast, the firm said it was due to hit double-digit revenue growth this financial year, and profitability per equity partner was on ""a sustained upward trajectory for several years"".

According to The Australian Financial Review Law Partnership Survey, Baker McKenzie had 82 partners as of January. The firm says its reduction in size is due to anticipated ""generational change"" prompted by a series of retirements.

Asia-Pacific managing partner Chris Freeland and equity capital markets head Antony Rumboll have both left Baker McKenzie in the past six months, to CPA Australia and Adamentum Capital respectively.

In a bid to revamp kickoff plays and enhance player safety, the NFL has been working on a groundbreaking concept known as the ""hybrid kickoff."" This kickoff change was recently reviewed at the Scouting Combine, and the league is still refining it for upcoming league meetings.

So what exactly is this hybrid kickoff all about? In the hybrid kickoff, the ball will be kicked off from the kicking team's 35-yard line. Meanwhile, ten players from the kicking team eagerly await at the receiving team's 40-yard line, as explained by NBC.

Moreover, on the receiving end, at least six players must stand ready at their own 35-yard line, with three more strategically positioned between the 35 and 30-yard lines. One or two players can also be placed out in the landing zone, anywhere between the goal line and the receiving team's 20-yard line. The action begins once the ball is caught or touches down in the landing zone. Let's break it down into pointers.

Notably, there won't be any returns from the end zone, adding a fresh twist to keep players safe from high-speed collisions. Additionally, the same kickoff applies after a safety but with a 15-yard setback. Here the teams can choose between a regular kick with a tee or a punt.

Now if talking about the onside kick, it will be reserved exclusively for the fourth quarter providing the scoring team is trailing. The ball must make contact with a player on the ground between the kicking team's 35-yard line and the receiving team's 40-yard line. And as for the receiving team's setup, well, that's still up for debate.

But before you get too excited, remember, that change isn't a one-man show. At least 24 team owners must give the nod for any rules tweaks to take effect. If they vote for the change, then we are back to the old rules from before 2023, saying goodbye to the fair catch between the 25 and the goal line.

The aim here is clearly to make kickoffs more fun while keeping players safe. However, will the big bosses in the league like this groundbreaking idea?

On one hand, team owners are mulling over new kickoff rules to make the game more exciting. But on the other hand, there's talk about banning the ""swivel hip-drop"" tackle, to keep the players safe. This move involves a defender wrapping up the ball carrier with both arms and then twisting or dropping their hips or lower body to bring them down.

But not everyone is on board with this idea. The NFL Players Association (NFLPA) worries that it could lead to confusion for players, coaches, referees, and fans alike. While the NFLPA is all for improving the game's safety, they are asking the league to think twice before making this rule change.

So, as the league debates these issues, it's a waiting game to see what decisions they will make and how they will impact the game we love.",thesportsrush.com,news,The SportsRush,Aniket Srivastava,0.1607843137254903,448688701,1,https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/1c92e4b1-untitled-design-57.png,

Declining production from Bass Strait, which has historically supplied around two-thirds of southern Australia's gas, means the supply gap will only increase, according to the latest modelling released on Thursday.

There was a risk of peak-day shortfalls under extreme winter conditions from 2025 and the potential for small seasonal supply gaps from 2026 in southern states, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warned.

AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman reiterated that gas-fired electricity generation would be an essential component of the future energy mix as the network moves from coal to mostly renewable energy

Pipelines, import terminals and storage upgrades as well as renewable gases were recommended to keep pace with demand.

Energy Minister Chris Bowen conceded longer-term challenges remained despite efforts to control price spikes and make sure affordable gas would be available.

He said the annual gas statement showed the importance of the gas code of conduct and a $12 per gigajoule price cap to shore up an affordable domestic supply of gas.

The average gas price to date in March is $11.63/GJ, and the average price over the year to date is $11.54/GJ, compared to levels above $30 at the peak of the energy crisis.

In the northern regions, where the majority of gas is produced for export, investment would also be needed to meet international and domestic demand, according to the operator.

While the energy transition creates uncertainty for gas consumption, all scenarios identify the ""urgent need"" for new investments to maintain supply adequacy.

""Flexible gas-powered electricity generation is an essential component of the energy mix into the future,"" Mr Westerman said.

In fact, gas for power generation forecasts have increased since the 2023 gas statement to reflect an expected ""long-term increase"" in use.

AEMO pointed to an increasing need as coal generators are retired and electrical demand increases through electrification, particularly during winter seasons when solar output is lower.

Gas-fired generators on the east coast may soon burn diesel at extra cost and emissions to plug energy shortages unless there is urgent government investment in infrastructure and new gas, according to producers.

Australian Energy Producers chief executive Samantha McCulloch said the ""warning bells are getting louder as report after report forecasts gas shortfalls and exposes the urgent need for new east coast gas supply.""

But Climate Solutions analyst Tom Quinn said if Australia is facing shortfalls, gas exports should be limited to protect industry and households rather than opening up new fields.

The Australian Pipeline and Gas Association said the forecasts showed time was quickly running out to bring on new gas supply to help ensure a smooth transition to net zero.

Energy analyst Kevin Morrison at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis questioned the accuracy of the forecasts.

""There is no shortage of gas in eastern Australia given three-quarters of the gas produced in the region is used as feedstock for LNG exports or is consumed in converting gas to LNG,"" he said.

""AEMO could be setting themselves up for another year of over estimating demand, he said.

A Victoria market update, also released on Thursday, found Australia's top gas-consuming state faced peak-day gas shortages from 2025, despite a ban on new residential gas connections that came into effect on January 1.

Supply forecasts have worsened as a result of investment uncertainty and project delays, according to gas producers.

Ms McCulloch said the report warned Victoria's gas supply would almost halve by 2028 as Gippsland Basin fields reach the end of production.",aap.com.au,news,AustralianAssociatedPress,,0.0980392156862746,448686417,1,https://www-media.aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/14172005/bbb07e10-16c3-441f-a008-13d3ea59feac.jpg?v=1686727205,eng-9412286

GenAI integration has emerged as the leading opportunity in EY's 2024 ranking of top prospects for technology companies. The report outlines ten key opportunities for the year ahead, including injecting GenAI into digital transformation strategies and experimenting with it in targeted front- and back-office use cases.

This shift towards GenAI reflects a broader trend in the industry, where companies are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to drive innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage.

With GenAI at the forefront of digital transformation strategies, organizations are poised to unlock new levels of productivity and agility, propelling them ahead in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

While recognising the immense potential of GenAI, the report also cautions that the majority of organisations are still in the early stages of AI maturity, urging companies to establish an ""AI control tower"" to ensure safe and ethical AI deployments.

This emphasis on responsible AI adoption underscores the importance of aligning technological advancement with ethical considerations and human values, thereby fostering trust and mitigating potential risks associated with AI implementation.

Ken Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, emphasised the pivotal role of AI in reshaping business strategies for future success. He highlighted the need for organisations to embrace AI as a central component of their operations, not only to accelerate their transformation journeys but also to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.

By leveraging AI effectively, technology companies can position themselves as leaders in innovation and drive sustainable growth in a competitive global market.

Additionally, Joongshik Wang, EY Asean Technology Leader, noted a shortage of skilled GenAI talent across Southeast Asia, underscoring the need for investment in training and organizational commitment.

In order to fully realise the benefits of GenAI, companies must prioritise talent development and foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation. This includes investing in reskilling programs and creating pathways for employees to acquire the necessary skills to harness the power of AI effectively.

The report also highlights the importance of shaping corporate investment strategies around the AI roadmap and diversifying supply chains in emerging markets.

In an era of increasing geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain disruptions, companies must adapt their strategies to mitigate risks and capitalise on emerging opportunities in new markets.

By establishing additional supply chains in regions such as India and Southeast Asia, companies can diversify their operations and reduce their dependence on traditional supply chain networks that may be vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

To address the growing demand for GenAI, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, observes the emergence of talent ecosystems across Southeast Asia, facilitating investment, recruitment, and training.

These ecosystems bring together technology companies and professional services organizations to collaborate on talent development initiatives, enabling companies to access a pool of skilled professionals and scale their operations more effectively. By leveraging these talent ecosystems, companies can overcome the challenge of talent shortages and accelerate their AI adoption efforts.

Furthermore, prioritising energy efficiency in data centers and establishing additional supply chains in emerging markets are identified as critical priorities for technology companies in 2024.

As the demand for AI and data-driven technologies continues to grow, so too does the energy consumption of data centers required to support these technologies. By prioritizing energy efficiency measures, companies can reduce their environmental footprint and operating costs, while also ensuring the sustainability of their operations in the long term.

In conclusion, the rise of GenAI represents a transformative opportunity for technology companies to drive innovation, efficiency, and growth in an increasingly digital world.

By embracing AI as a central component of their strategies and investing in talent development, companies can unlock new levels of productivity and competitiveness, while also addressing ethical considerations and sustainability concerns.

As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, companies that successfully harness the power of AI will be best positioned to thrive in the digital economy of the future.",sme.asia,news,SME & Entrepreneurship Magazine,Dafizeck Daud,0.5921568627450979,448684218,1,https://sme.asia/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ai_artificial-intelligence_circuit-board_circuitry_mother-board_nodes_computer-chips-100777423-large.jpg,eng-9412863

This $21.2B industry has experienced explosive growth in the last decade and is no longer solely the domain of people ""famous for being famous"" hawking beauty supplies. Just ask heat pump manufacturers like Mr. Cool and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers like Tesla, Rivian, Harley-Davidson, Bosch eBike Systems, and others.

According to a recently released Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report, the majority of marketers currently leveraging it view the strategy as effective, plan to increase the amount of content they'll produce in support of it, and intend to increase the percentage of their budget dedicated to it in 2024. In fact, nearly a quarter of marketers currently using influencer marketing intend to spend more than 40% of their entire marketing budget on influencer campaigns in 2024. Technology is also coming to influencer marketing, with 63% planning to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to identify influencers or create effective campaigns. The industry is expected to grow 5% to $22.2B by 2025.

Influencer marketing is commonly activated on social media, but it can also support traditional paid or earned media campaigns and events as well.

With EVs most interesting to Gen Z adults and Millennials, it's important utility program marketing strategies take preferred communication methods and likely engagement channels into account.

Don't panic, but that means social media and influencer marketing are likely going to be necessary to drive success in transportation electrification campaigns. The good news is that it's less risky and more affordable, targetable, and accessible than you might think.

Despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk's claims that he ""hates advertising"" and that ""Tesla doesn't use marketing,"" he's an influencer in his own right who has, for better or worse, created a personal connection to the brand. Celebrities and influencers in the US and China have been critical to Tesla's success. And it's estimated it only took 50 of them to help Tesla earn the majority share of voice when it announced its Series 3 car. Some were big name celebrities, others regular people who generated good, relevant content and had large followings. Ultimately, influencer marketing created a 500,000-unit backlog for Tesla, and at the time, nobody could even test drive the car. Let that sink in for a minute.

Likewise, Harley-Davidson LiveWires and Rivian R1Ts supported a three-month trip across 13,000 miles of challenging terrain, elevation, and weather in support of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's Long Way Up series on Apple TV, which I wrote about here. While it looked like traditional product placement, this was influencer marketing. The brands selected actors and an adventure aligned with their missions and used it to accelerate learning and demand for their EVs. Rivian paired it with public relations to promote charging along their Adventure Network, which includes National Parks.

Smaller brands with smaller budgets have used influencer marketing to break into the electrification market as well.

Influencer marketing's ability to help brands develop authentic connections and drive engagement could be important to the utility industry's electrification evolution. With much of the target market digital natives that regularly use social media, this marketing strategy becomes even more important and timely. To get started, consider the following:

Utilities should consider influencer campaigns to augment more traditional forms of marketing in support of their transportation electrification programs.

""Typically, it was those that travelled; pre-COVID I was travelling a lot so you would work from home in the morning before going to the airport, or you ended up doing it from hotels while on the road.""

""Definitely, the scramble that we went through when they did the first lockdown, was pretty much the first run for both us and our customers."" Okulicz added.

All manners of issues that nobody had to consider popped up in the process. Okulicz mentioned remote work licensing which was traditionally through a virtual private network (VPN).

Normally, you would size the VPN at say 10 percent of the workforce.

""It wasn't ever designed for 100 per cent of people working from home, because I don't think anyone had imagined a scenario where that would happen,"" Okulicz said.

While an extreme scenario, the lockdowns drove home the need to understand the demands of a new reality quickly. It focused Kytec even more on the requirements for a hybrid workplace.

Staff and organisations can miss out with WfH

But why not just go fully WfH? Okulicz conceded that working from home has incredible personal benefits to staff, and there's nothing employers can do to replace them.

""If they move their career aspirations aside, 90 percent of people would just want to work from home,"" Okulicz said.

There will be people, a small cohort, that want to come into the office because it's social, they like the environment and value that, he said.

Nothing is ever black and white and fully straightforward though, and there are some real career risks for employees with WfH, particularly for younger people starting out.

""Probably one of the biggest impacts we saw from not being in the office is that the learning by association thing is not happening,"" Okulicz said.

You hear how people talk about how they solved an issue, or even just a senior person working on something with a customer, and a junior staffer wanting to tag along, to learn more.

""Send everyone home, and you miss that opportunity,"" Okulicz pointed out.

How much this matters is nuanced, depending on staff roles.

""A developer that sits there, and belts out code for eight hours a day is going to be more productive at home than in the office where they could potentially be distracted,"" Okulicz said.

For team workers however, its a different story. When an employee needs the team to do the work, and to report progress to a team leader once a day, there's a risk of productivity being lost in a WfH scenario, Okulicz said.

Finding the hybrid work balance

There are organisational objectives as well to consider, and companies have to figure out where the balance is between those and what employees want.

This is before getting into thorny WfH issues such as whether the home is suitable for purpose. This may be difficult, particularly for people starting out in their careers and who share housing.

Even if a company's tech stack is robust, employees leaving the office may not have the necessary security posture in their homes with the appropriate gear, particularly if they have to handle confidential and/or sensitive personal information.

It can be outsiders being able to overhear work conversations, or a simple issue like not having your colleagues next to you to verify things.

""Impersonation is a massive problem, and a much bigger threat when working from home,"" Okulicz said.

Okulicz gave the example of his chief financial officer sitting next to him in the office. If that person gets an email about transferring money, getting gift vouchers, paying something, that would by itself raise a red flag.

""What are you doing, sending me emails when you're sitting next to me?"" the CFO would ask.

In a WfH setting, especially if different time zones are involved, that basic security check could fail and the email would be responded to.

However, WfH isn't going away so what can employers do to encourage face-to-face in an office, particularly for team workers who need to collaborate for best results?

""One of the things we did try to bring people back - and it's not just about whacking a screen and video conferencing unit on a wall - is about understanding how each space could and would be used,"" Okulicz said.

Kytec has built a bunch of focus rooms for meetings, with space for one or two people. This lets staff in the office hold meetings with others who are remote, without having to wear headphones, in a quiet space that's nice to be in, Okulicz said.

""If you incorporate workspace design into your WfH or hybrid work strategy you get this really great outcome where the office just seems to work for everybody,"" he said.

Work continues to change and evolve, and offices have to adapt to make the most of it. Kytec's approach has helped the company to match what the organisation wants to achieve with staff getting the benefits they want.

As a result, staff retention, productivity and morale have improved and flexibility is providing benefits for both staff and Kytec.",itnews.com.au,news,iTnews,Juha Saarinen,0.192156862745098,448681683,1,https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Features/meeting_painting.JPG,

UK Defence Attempts Procurement Reform, Again","Two years of warfare in Ukraine have fundamentally shifted the landscape of defence. NATO allies have demonstrated impressive commitment to supporting a partner in need and the war has driven an unprecedented drive towards European collective defence.

Such support carries a cost. The United Kingdom alone has pledged almost £12 billion in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which £7.1 billion is for military assistance. Just last week, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps announced the supply of another thousand drones. The war has exposed a challenge: how can allies gear their defence industries up to deliver materiel to Ukraine while remaining fit for purpose at home?

The ambition to speed up the delivery of defence capabilities is at the heart of recently announced reforms from the UK Ministry of Defence. By introducing a new integrated procurement model (), the Ministry aims to consciously integrate lessons learned from past programmes -- successful and otherwise -- and, in the words of Defence Minister James Cartlidge, make ""every day count.""

On paper, the new model seems to embed many approaches RAND has identified over the years to address some of the persistent challenges in defence acquisition. As successive governments have found, defence acquisition is almost uniquely difficult. Budgetary planning is difficult in a market defined by limited competition, high barriers for companies seeking to enter it, and an ever-changing geopolitical backdrop: now more than ever.

In the integrated model, the government and industry engage much earlier than before in identifying future needs and requirements. The reforms package calls for ""exportability"" to be borne in mind from the start of all programmes and for a ""spiral development"" approach to capability. The latter is supposed to drive faster delivery and enable upgrades and modifications as technology and threats evolve. All these reforms are likely to be welcomed by the defence industry, as they should improve how quickly new products can reach the market as well as their potential for commercial success through exports. There are still gaps to be addressed through further guidance, though. For example, what does ""spiral development"" truly mean in practice? As is common in defence, this often-used phrase means different things to different people.

There is also a welcome recognition of the need for an honest dialogue between government and industry on risk as it evolves in acquisition programmes, achieved through ""a new alliance"" between government and industry, with government for its part being ""more transparent"" on its acquisition needs. The reforms also reflect a desire to drive greater integration, rather than competition, across Services and domains (land, sea, air, and cyber) by adopting a portfolio-style approach to acquisition. The Ministry, like many public sector bodies, has long aspired to avoid duplication of effort and achieve better integration with partners and between its own departments in procurement.

If these ambitions could be achieved, they certainly have the potential to improve the Ministry's approach to procurement. The integrated procurement model is creditable. In 2022, RAND Europe was asked to inform the delivery of the Defence Space Strategy back in 2022. As space strategy was a new domain offering a ""blank slate,"" researchers highlighted many of the approaches now shown in these reforms as good practices to be baked into space capability acquisition. As the war in Ukraine has shown us, a faster and smarter approach to defence acquisition is required across NATO and beyond. The House of Commons Defence Committee summed this up bluntly in their 2023 parliamentary report () on procurement in the UK: ""It is broken -- and it's time to fix it.""

However, as often is the case in policy reform, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As yet, there is very little detail on how the new strategy would be implemented -- and effective implementation is exactly what is needed to translate the vision into new or improved processes and structures.

Next, changes will need to be embraced by teams across defence, industry, and government. UK defence acquisition processes have been frequently tweaked in recent history, from the Bernard Gray Review of Acquisition in 2009, to the launching of Defence Equipment & Support as a standalone body in 2014, which means that energising teams to accept the latest round of transformation can be a real challenge. Coming within a week of a significant new UK strategy on drones () which also identified acquisition improvements, and alongside a range of NATO initiatives, there is a risk of trying to change a lot at once without a clear sense of prioritisation and coherence.

The introductory document released by the MOD in February recognises that embedding these reforms will require no less than a cultural shift, something that has repeatedly been called for over a long period of time; it was the subject of Bill Kincaid of RUSI's book 'Changing the Dinosaur's Spots: The Battle to Reform UK Defence Acquisition' as long ago as 2008. It will take time and focused attention to achieve this. Enabling spiral acquisition, for example, will require greater risk appetite. Defence is, to an extent, culturally defined by a tendency towards optimism bias and siloes, which are persistently difficult to break. Perhaps a new model and new process will address these underlying issues, but changing behaviours and culture throughout an enterprise with big budgets and responsibility for programmes that span decades is no small challenge.

Most importantly, whilst processes, culture and pace matter in defence acquisition, money talks. The UK's Spring Budget announcement this year made absolutely no mention of defence in the short term. Although there is a line on an £11 billion investment in defence to take UK defence spending to 2.3 percent of GDP, this is a repetition of announcements in Spring 2023 (). Perhaps, then, the underlying challenge for UK defence is fundamentally about balancing ambition and capacity. The United Kingdom has shown great resolve and efficiency in providing Ukraine with the equipment that it needs, but must now ensure that this approach can be replicated and scaled up to serve its own.",rand.org,news,Rand Corporation,,0.2705882352941176,448678670,1,https://wwwassets.rand.org/content/rand/pubs/commentary/2024/03/pace-through-integration-uk-defence-attempts-procurement/jcr:content/par/teaser.crop.600x317.ct.jpeg/1710981991977.jpeg,

ONE Store and HAPPYTUK Collaborate on Platform, Ecosystem, Operations, and Marketing Plans to Launch Local App Market in Taiwan by Year-End, Accelerating Global Market Entry ONE Store Partners with Key Players like Krafton and Digital Turbine for Global Expansion

TAIPEI and SEOUL, South Korea, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ONE Store, Korea's second largest app market outperforming global competitors, announced that it has signed a platform and service agreement with HAPPYTUK, Taiwan's largest game publishing company, to provide an app market service targeting the Taiwanese market.

As a leading game publisher in Taiwan, HAPPYTUK operates subsidiaries across Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and beyond. Since its establishment in 2012, HAPPYTUK has expanded its business beyond publishing to include game operation, marketing, and development, demonstrating comprehensive capabilities across the gaming industry. It owns mangtot5, a game-specialized portal with over 4 million members, boasting the largest membership base in Taiwan. Additionally, it offers the most extensive number of game titles among publishers in Taiwan.

ONE Store will provide its platform and developer ecosystem, while HAPPYTUK will manage platform operation and marketing. Both companies will collaboratively handle the sourcing of game content in Taiwan. ONE Store plans to open an alternative app market in Taiwan by the end of this year, based on this agreement.

Once the ONE Store and HAPPYTUK app market launches, developers can immediately offer services in both the Korean and Taiwanese markets by onboarding ONE Store. Both companies aim to assist developers with diverse promotional activities and ensure seamless service provision by integrating multiple payment options within Taiwan.

ONE Store, which is extending its reach into the global market beyond its position as a leading domestic app market, is accelerating this process by securing strategic partners one after another. Last month, ONE Store signed a cooperation agreement with Digital Turbine APPS, a global mobile platform company, securing a total investment of USD 50 million. Prior to this, in October of last year, ONE Store brought in KRW 20 billion from Krafton, and in 2021 USD 15 million from Microsoft MSFT and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP). These strategic partnerships are paving the way for ONE Store's ambitious global expansion.

ONE Store plans to secure blockbuster games and accelerate its global expansion based on successful fundraising. Additionally, ONE Store has stepped up the expansion of overseas business based on global tailwinds from the movement to ensure fairer competition such as mandatory introduction of independent app markets (Digital Markets Act) which is underway in global markets including Europe and US.

""We are pleased to embark on a full-scale entry into the Asian market with HAPPYTUK, Taiwan's top publisher. With this agreement, ONE Store aims to make this year the starting point of expanding our overseas business and evolving into one of the most influential global app markets"" said Peter Chun, CEO of ONE Store.

""We are delighted to provide customers with ONE Store, a leading app store in Korea. We look forward to a variety of games which we will provide going forward"" said Ryan Yang, CEO of HAPPYTUK.

Mercedes is among them and the luxury brand has announced plans to offer a GLC 350e 4MATIC in the United States.

Set to arrive in the second half of the year, the crossover has a plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a 24.8 kWh battery pack, and an electric motor. This setup gives the model a combined output of 313 hp (233 kW / 317 PS) and 406 lb-ft (550 Nm) of torque.

That's significantly more than the GLC 300 4MATIC and it enables the crossover to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in approximately 6.6 seconds. Given enough room, the hybrid model will eventually hit an electronically limited top speed of 135 mph (217 km/h).

Mercedes didn't provide EPA estimates, but noted the European model has a WLTP electric-only range of up to 81 miles (130 km). Americans can expect the final number to be far less impressive, but the company said many trips can be completed without using the internal combustion engine.

When the battery is low, a 60 kW DC fast charger can fully replenish it in around 30 minutes. At home, you're looking at an AC charging rate of up to 11 kW.

Pricing will be announced closer to launch, but the plug-in hybrid will be offered in three different trims. The entry-level model is slated to have LED lighting units, rain-sensing wipers, and a self-leveling suspension. Other highlights include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, an 11.9-inch infotainment system, and a wireless smartphone charger. Buyers will also find digital key technology, a 64-color ambient lighting system, and 16-way power front seats with heating.

The Exclusive trim ups the ante with illuminated door sill plates, enhanced ambient lighting, and a Burmester premium audio system. The model also has a surround view camera and a Guard 360 security system.

The range-topping Pinnacle trim goes even further as it has a head-up display as well as heat and noise insulating glass.

That's what three major worldwide heavy truck manufacturers seem to be saying in getting ready for vehicle electrification.

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Volvo Trucks North America, Navistar and Daimler Truck North America are trying to reduce transportation's carbon footprint by taking a collective approach.

Those three OEMs - which produce the Volvo, Mack, International, Freightliner, Western Star and Rizon nameplate electric trucks -- represent 70% of all new Class 6-8 truck sales in the U.S.

In February, they announced a cooperative call ""Powering America's Commercial Transportation (PACT)."" It calls for the three OEMs to focus on education and advocacy for accelerating the construction of national infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs).

It is similar to a cooperative finalized in Europe in 2022 that calls for Volvo Group, Daimler Truck and Navistar parent Traton to jointly install and operate a $550 million high-performance public charging network for electric, heavy-duty, long-haul trucks and buses.

The European cooperative is called ""Milence."" Its goal is installation and operation of at least 1,700 high-performance green energy charging points on and close to highways by 2027.

According to the International Council on Clean Energy Transportation, nearly 700,000 chargers will be needed in the U.S. to accommodate 1 million Class 4-8 medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs anticipated to be deployed by 2030. Those trucks are forecast to use 140,000 megawatts of electricity every day -- or the monthly energy needs of over 100 million American homes.

""The scale of infrastructure required for medium- and heavy-duty EV adoption is unprecedented,"" Stephen Roy, president of Mack Trucks and chairman of Volvo Group North America, said at the rollout at the National Press Club in Washington.

Daimler Truck North America President and CEO John O'Leary admitted the transition to zero-emission vehicles is ""stalling"" without the deployment of the needed charging infrastructure.

""We need some help,"" O'Leary said during PACT's launch at the National Press Club.

O'Leary spoke alongside OEM presidents, Navistar's Mathias Carlbaum and Volvo Trucks North America President Peter Voorhoeve. O'Leary stated the PACT's premise of working toward the same vision and goal as an industry.

""We want other players out there, whether it's utilities, equipment manufacturers, [and] all that - we need everybody in this game together and then all rowing in the same direction,"" O'Leary said.

""Partnership is the new leadership,"" Voorhoeve said.

""The footprint of transportation in the U.S. is very favorable for electrification,"" Navistar's Carlbaum said.

The need for speed is paramount in the U.S. market, American trucking fleet executives say.

""While electric vehicles are hitting the market first, they may not be suitable for every application at this time -- especially when it comes to regional and long-haul transportation,"" Kent Williams, Averitt Express executive vice president of sales and marketing, told LM.""We believe EVs could be the way of the future for all Class 8 tractors, but there are significant issues preventing adoption at scale now.""

Among the issues is current EV tractors do not have the range for most fleet applications. Nor would EVs work well in the 24-hour environment that most long-haul fleets operate.

""The most significant challenge is that our facilities lack the necessary physical infrastructure from local electric companies that would allow us to charge an adequate number of tractors each day,"" Averitt's Williams said.

Most Averitt facilities are domiciles for more than 100 power units. ""Most of these facilities would require a new electrical substation to be built to charge fleets of this scale,"" Williams added.

While supporting the deployment of commercial ZEV infrastructure, PACT will not advocate for specific vehicle, power generation or utility distribution technologies.

Rather PACT's primary purpose is to educate stakeholders about infrastructure challenges that hinder medium- and heavy-duty ZEV adoption in the marketplace and work with stakeholders to find solutions for the benefit of all interested parties.

PACT's founders said membership is open to all stakeholders with an interest in accelerating the deployment of zero-emission trucks and the necessary infrastructure. Besides the three OEMs, founding members include ABB E-mobility, Burns & McDonnell, the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, Greenlane, Prologis Inc. and Voltera.",supplychain247.com,news,supplychain247.com,John D.

Set to arrive late this year, the van features a plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine, a ""high-voltage"" battery, an electric motor, and a six-speed dual-clutch transmission.

While Ford was coy on specifics, the company confirmed the model will have a combined output of 148 hp (110 kW / 150 PS) and 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) of torque.

More importantly, the van has an electric-only range of approximately 68 miles (110 km). However, recharging the battery won't be a quick process as the model only supports a DC fast charging rate of 50 kW. That's a little low, but at least it's significantly faster than the AC rate of up to 11 kW.

To help optimize battery usage, the van has four different settings known as EV Auto, EV Now, EV Later, and EV Reserve. The first three settings are self-explanatory, but EV Reserve ""saves a driver-defined level of battery energy for use later.""

The plug-in hybrid powertrain will be available on the five-passenger Tourneo Connect and the seven-passenger Grand Tourneo Connect. The models will also be offered in Trend, Titanium, and Active trim.

Equipment varies, but even the entry-level Trend has a 10-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10-inch infotainment system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

As the costs involved in sensor technology decrease its usage will spread to new market segments including new areas with products that have never previously used such functionalities, including, wood fibre based products for packaging, hygiene or graphical use. Currently there is a significant interest in developing technology that will allow packages to become interactive and be integrated with digital services accessible on the Internet. In this thesis, the system integration of a hybrid RFID based sensor platform is presented. This proposed platform provides a trade-off between the communication performance and its compatibility with international standards and also includes flexibility in on?package customization, including the type and number of sensors. In addition it combines the use of traditional silicon based electronics with printed electronics directly onto wood fibre based materials so as to enable the possibility of creating smart packages. Together with the system integration of the sensor platform, five printed moisture sensor concepts that are designed to work with the sensor platform are presented and characterized. Firstly, there is a moisture sensor that shows a good correlation to the moisture content of wood fibre based substrates. The second one involves a sensor that detects high relative humidity levels in the air and the third is an action activated energy cell that provides power when activated by moisture. The fourth one deals with two types of moisture sensors that utilize silver nano-particles in order to measure the relative humidity in the air. The final one is a printable touch sensitive sensor that is sensitive to the moisture contained in the hand. A concept of remote moisture sensing that utilizes ordinary low cost RFID tags has also been presented and characterized.The main focus is thus on system integration to, by combining silicon based electronics with printed electronics, find the most low cost solution with regards to flexibility, sensor functions and still meet the communication standards.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.3254901960784313,448670532,1,,

Now that in-office pandemic restrictions have been lifted, employers are forced to navigate how to properly balance in-office and remote work in a way that maximizes both efficiency and employee wellbeing.

As more companies adopt hybrid models, the system for many is unclear. In a November 2022 Mercer report, only 34% of organizations reported they have formal rules in place for managing flexible work. Based on an assessment of 749 organizations, the survey found that 48% relied on information or ambiguous guidelines and 17% were completely hands-off.

It's not just employers who are having difficulty defining ""hybrid."" Employees also find the ambiguity of hybrid norms confusing -- according to a 2022 Gallop poll, six in 10 employees want more structure, but a little over one-third agree on how to define ""hybrid"" in their organization.

Definitional issues aside, the problem with increasing remote work is that it decreases the presence of human-to-human interaction in the workplace. The very idea of a workplace is built on the philosophy that people are more effective when they come together to solve their problems, and in our post-lockdown world, it seems evident that some element of that humanity is lost in remote work. If success in the workplace is a priority, then some degree of office presence is key. Here is how employers and employees can be more successful in an unstructured hybrid environment.

Businesses struggling to promote in-office activity first need to understand that, no matter how much more productive in-office work may feel, their employees want to retain some level of remote work. Today, an astonishing 98% of employees prefer to maintain an element of remote work in their jobs, and no company can succeed when 98% of its employees are angry. Regardless of your opinion, remote work is seen as a norm in our post-Pandemic world, and it is going to stay that way. Implementing more rigid hybrid work guidelines should not be about control, but compromise. Learn to make the most out of your in-office time.

Moving to more in person meetings may be an effective use of in-office time. Web conferencing platforms are transactional and good for inputs and outputs, not necessarily the best tool to generate ideas, leverage strategic thinking, or build trusting relationships. Office time should be for connecting and collaboration. It is unproductive to come into the office to video conference all day. As practical, have team meetings, one-on-ones, and stand-ups in the office. In-person meetings and video conferencing can co-exist.

Strategic thinking leads to success. Take a leap; brainstorm. It's hard to brainstorm virtually -- a whiteboard, employees and ideas can lead to more solutions than web conferencing meetings where not only do they lack asynchrony and body language, it's difficult to tell who (if anyone) is paying attention. Nonverbal communication, interpersonal dynamics and an ability to read the room are catalysts of collaboration. That's a tall order for a web conferencing meeting or email exchange.

Eyes and ears are your biggest asset in an in-office environment. Eyes observe. Ears listen. Use time in the office to listen, learn and engage. Talk to people, get to know them, and let them get to know you. Sharing talents, building relationships and learning in the workplace leads to success.

Working in office can provide competitive advantages for the right employee and the right organization. Whether a manager or employee, it is hard to create a collaborative workplace relationship virtually. Humans are social beings with an innate need for belonging and connecting. In-office activity allows for ad hoc engagement - maybe white boarding goals, ideas and solutions, along with building community. Maybe even an unscheduled lunch or coffee meeting.

The office is a breeding ground of leaders and mentors that an employee can learn from simply by observation. Managers naturally gravitate to those they know, those they have had more than a transactional communication with, those they have had in-person conversations, compared with those that only communicate by video call.

As employers navigate the remote, hybrid, and in-office challenges facing them, employees should reflect on how best to succeed within the organization. How to define ""hybrid,"" think about how you define your personal success, and work in-office as collaboration allows. Take the unfair advantage.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.09019607843137245,448669679,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65f23702d51c849f9d6a3a30/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,

Now They're The South, Shooting Like Howitzers.","I write about ships, planes, tanks, drones, missiles and satellites.

Just two weeks after appearing in photos with the Ukrainian army's 5th Tank Brigade, the Ukrainians' ex-Slovenian M-55S tanks showed up in a video shot by the territorial forces' 127th Brigade.

The hybrid tanks -- which combine the hulls and turrets of 1950s-vintage, Soviet-made T-55 tanks with modern Israeli fire-controls and a classic L7 105-millimeter main gun from the United Kingdom -- have been shuffled around the Ukrainian order of battle like a deck of cards.

So who knows any more which unit actually owns the 36-ton, four-person tanks, 28 of which Slovenia donated to Ukraine in late 2022.

The 127th Brigade defends the sector between Stepove and Pryyutne in southern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast. It's not the most violent sector of the front but neither is it particularly quiet. Russian regiments launched an offensive in this area in January and have, in three months, advanced around a mile.

It's not clear how the 127th Brigade came to operate -- or at least borrow -- some or all of the 27 M-55Ss that survive after the Russians plinked one with artillery last year.

Earlier this month, it seemed the new 5th Brigade -- which for months has been organizing and training in Kryvyi Rih in the south and which is one of the few intact brigades the Ukrainian army still has in reserve -- had taken on the ex-Slovenian tanks.

That made some sense, as the 5th Tank Brigade apparently also operates German-made Leopard 1A5 tanks that have the same L7 gun the M-55Ss have -- and fire the same ammunition.

Before seemingly chopping to the 5th Tank Brigade, the M-55Ss passed from the 47th Mechanized Brigade to, perhaps, the 65th Mechanized Brigade. The 47th Brigade jettisoned the aging M-55Ss after getting modern, German-made Leopard 2A6s and then, later, American-made M-1s. The 65th Brigade for its part might be happy with its stalwart T-72s.

Maybe the 5th Tank is getting adequate numbers of Leopard 1s -- and could afford to give away the M-55Ss. Or maybe the 5th Tank kept some of the 27 hybrid tanks and transferred the rest.

In any event, the 127th Brigade apparently isn't trying anything fancy with the M-55Ss, whether it owns them or borrows them. Where the aggressive 47th Brigade famously rolls its M-1s into direct close combat with Russian assault groups in and around Berdychi in eastern Ukraine, the territorials seem to be deploying the lighter, less-protected ex-Slovenian tanks as crude howitzers.

The 127th Brigade's video depicts at least one M-55S traveling in broad daylight in the company of an all-terrain vehicle. The tank noses from a treeline, halts and angles its L7 gun high in order to shoot at something potentially miles away.

The Ukrainians and Russians alike often deploy tanks as howitzers, usually cueing them with aerial drones. While a tank's main gun can't hold up to the hard use that howitzers are designed for, the tank's mobility and protection makes it a useful expedient when purpose-made artillery isn't available.

And to be clear, artillery definitely has been in short supply in Ukraine. Not for a lack of guns, but for a lack of ammunition. After Russia-friendly Republicans in the U.S. Congress blocked further aid to Ukraine starting in October, Ukrainian batteries' daily allotment of large-caliber shells -- 122-, 152-, 155- and 203-millimeter -- dropped from 6,000 to 2,000.

In that context, right now an M-55S with a decent stock of 105-millimeter shells might actually be more valuable as a howitzer ... than as a tank.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.0117647058823529,448668503,1,"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb5b3c68b63932bd08b15e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1020,478,x0,y71,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds",

Google kicked off its 2021virtual I/O conference this week with a multiple-camera keynote staged outside on the Googleplex campus in Mountain View, CA, that included a number of announcements for developers.

Topping the list of dev-related announcements at this year's event: the latest version of the Android Studio IDE, Arctic Fox (2020.3.1), gets released to beta. Among the many updates and enhancements in this release, the standout is the integration of Google's native UI toolkit Jetpack Compose, the 1.0 release of which is due in July.

Jetpack Compose is a Kotlin-based declarative design framework for Android, desktop, and the web. (Desktop and web development is managed by the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.) It's used to create previews in different configurations and allows developers to navigate their code with Compose Preview, test it in isolation with Deploy Preview to Device, and inspect the complete app with Layout Inspector. Throughout iterations, devs can quickly edit strings and numbers and see immediate updates. Plus, with the Accessibility Scanner in Layout Editor, the View-based layouts are audited for accessibility problems. Jetpack Compose is designed to work with existing code and can be added to existing apps.

Google announced the alpha release if Jetpack Macrobenchmark, which helps developers analyze startup and animation lag in apps and pinpoint related issues.

Kotlin itself got a nod at the conference, including the announcement of a stable release of a new annotation processor API, called Kotlin Symbol Processing, which Google said should be as much two times faster than previous options, and generally more efficient. And the Kotlin DataStore, a Kotlin-first alternative to SharedPreferences, has entered beta.

The Arctic Fox release also adds support for Live Editing of literals, which means developers using Compose can edit literals (strings, numbers, Booleans) in their code and see the results immediately without needing to wait for compilation. ""The goal of the feature is to increase your productivity by having code changes appear near instantaneously in the previews, emulator, or physical device,"" explained Paris Hsu, interaction designed from Google's Android product and design group, explained in a blog post.

There's also new support for Google's Wear OS, Google TV, and Android Auto via new emulators and system images, not to mention the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.

And there's a list of new features and improvements in Arctic Fox that come with a major update of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE (v2020.3), which allows developers to test their apps with new features in Android 12, improve app performance with the updated UI for Memory Profiler, understand background task relationships with WorkManager Inspector (which allows devs to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that must be run reliably), and use Non-Transitive R classes IDE Refactoring to increase build speed.

Speaking of IntelliJ, the Arctic Fox beta includes the IntelliJ 2020.3 platform release; you'll notice Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 employs a similar numbering system. Hsu explained in her post:

As we announced late last year, we've changed our version numbering scheme to match the number for the IntelliJ IDE that Android Studio is based on, 2020.3, plus our own patch number, as well as a handy code name to make it easier to remember and refer to. We'll be using code names in alphabetical order; the first is Arctic Fox, now in beta, and the next is Bumblebee, now in canary.

The beta of Android Studio Arctic Fox is available now for download, as is the canary build of Bumblee (2021.1.1) here.",adtmag.com,news,ADTmag,,-0.0117647058823529,448667670,1,https://adtmag.com/-/media/ECG/redmondmag/Images/IntroImagesBigSmall/CodeRawOnScreenSmall.jpg,

Whether you're a blowout person or dry-and-style person, there are always two tools involved: In the first case, a hair dryer and round brush; in the second a dryer and straightener or curling iron. However, thermal brushes, also called heated brushes, seek to simplify the whole styling process.

Thermal hair brushes are ""reimagined curling irons and flat brushes with bristles,"" explains Kevin Lee, style director, Julien Farel Restore Salon and Spa in New York, who adds that there are two general camps of this hair tool, one that uses hot air, and one that uses heated plates.

Though they can have different functions, in general, they are used to help you achieve your desired hairstyle in less time than traditional hair tools.

Why?

Let's start with the remarkable fuel economy figures, as measured by Natural Resources Canada in its average of litres used per 100 km driven; 5.8 in the city, 6.3 on the highway, and six combined, with a 55-litre fuel tank running on regular 87 octane fuel.

What does that mean for you? Nearly 1,000 km of driving between gas station visits. Only the 2024 Ford Escape hybrid matches these figures.

All RAV4 hybrids feature standard all-wheel drive for added traction in inclement weather.

A 2.5-litre, four-cylinder engine keeps the RAV4 hybrid in motion. It produces a healthy 219 horsepower. Reaching highway speeds is done quickly and having the extra oomph beneath your right foot can help avoid a collision. Both city and highway driving are comfortable and the hybrid system allows you to drive with battery-only power at lower speeds, which saves you fuel. The car is good for long and short drives thanks to comfortable, supportive seats.

The tradeoff is the use of an electronic continuous variable transmission, which contributes to efficiency but can be slightly droning at higher speeds. The vehicle boasts a large cargo area of up to 1,977 l, with the rear seats down, and a spacious 1,059 with the rear seats up.

Practicality is a theme here and it continues in the cabin. As several automakers migrate to larger screens, haptic touch controls and futuristic designs, Toyota's 2024 RAV4 hybrid remains as a balance of modern and traditional throughout.

When you first sit down in the driver's seat, you'll notice large dials and buttons for the temperature controls, easy-to-see-and-use steering wheel controls, an equally simple-to-read instrument cluster and an old-school gear lever. It almost feels old by current design.

Heated seats, five USB charging ports, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and dual-zone climate controls come standard. My tester was the XLE trim, second from the bottom of the range, and it provided the more-than-adequate standard seven-inch instrument cluster (there's a 12.3-inch digital offering on higher trims) and the standard eight-inch infotainment screen. Higher trims feature a slightly larger 10.5-inch screen. All the screen sizes are more than enough for daily driving.

The climate controls are oh-so-easy-to-use with large dials, clearly labelled buttons and an easy-to-read screen. The only oddity is the heated steering wheel button, above your left knee.

The top ""Limited"" trim features ventilated seats, heated rear seats and a power passenger seat, while all but the base trim feature a large sunroof, power tailgate, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel and push-button start. Toyota has packaged the RAV4 hybrid well, so there's something for nearly every buyer in this segment.

If standard safety ranks high on your list, the RAV4 hybrid includes the following: right- and left-turn, oncoming pedestrian detection and braking; lane-tracing assist; left-turn, oncoming vehicle detection and braking; automatic high beams; lane-departure alert with steering assist; pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, cyclist detection and night time pedestrian detection; a blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert.

The price ranges from $35,950 for the LE and caps out at $46,950 for the Limited. Add in freight, predelivery inspection and other fees, and, of course, provincial taxes, and the Toyota RAV4 hybrid is competitively priced.

The survey sheds light on critical challenges administrators face in integrating technology into higher education.

The CIN Administrator EdTech Survey identified four key takeaway areas for institutions and EdTech vendors to improve the EdTech experience for both administrators and students:

""Higher education is grappling with multiple critical disruptions, and administrators sit at the center of these shifting demands, responsible for making campus-wide decisions that have an outsized impact on students and faculty,"" said Omid Fotuhi, Director of Learning and Innovation at WGU Labs. ""While administrators are excited about offering new EdTech tools, they are lacking knowledge and data to help them make informed decisions that benefit students and faculty. This survey underscores the need for more resources to inform decision-making, which will help foster the broader adoption of EdTech.""

With responses from 214 administrators representing diverse colleges and universities across the U.S., the survey delves into decision-making processes, attitudes toward educational technology, and approaches to emerging AI technologies. The overarching goal of the survey is to identify challenges in administrators' experiences and uncover opportunities to streamline the integration of technology into instruction moving forward.

The Princeton Review® -- the education services company known for its school rankings in dozens of categories -- today reported its 15th annual ranking of undergraduate and graduate schools with the best programs in game design studies.

For the second year in a row, New York University ranked #1 on the undergraduate schools list, which names the top 50 schools. NYU's Game Design program is based at the university's Brooklyn campus.

On the graduate schools list, which names the top 25 schools, the University of Central Florida in Orlando earned the #1 spot -- up from #2 on the list in 2023.

The top 10 schools on the undergraduate and graduate school lists are below as well as #1 schools by region in seven regions. The complete lists are posted on The Princeton Review website at Top Game Design Schools for 2024.

The Princeton Review's game design school rankings are based on more than 40 data points derived from the company's 2023 survey of administrators at 150 schools offering game design courses and/or degrees. Most of the institutions are in the U.S., with two in Canada and four abroad.

The 50-question survey covered four areas: academics, faculty, technology, and career topics. Detailed information about the survey methodology and rankings criteria is here.

PC Gamer, a top online and print gaming publication, has been The Princeton Review's reporting partner on this project since 2013. The magazine's May issue, which lands on newsstands today, has a six-page feature on the project. Titled ""The Best Game Design Programs Ranked by The Princeton Review 2024,"" it reports the two categories of ranking lists with interesting stats as well as fun facts about the schools' graduates, faculty, and alumni. The feature also includes two articles on video game creation titled ""Theorycrafting & Player Choice"" and ""Live Service Gaming & The Infinite Narrative.""

The top 10 schools on the list ""Top 50 Undergraduate Schools for Game Design"" are:

The top 10 schools on the list ""Top 25 Graduate Schools for Game Design"" are:

The lists by region and the #1 undergraduate and graduate schools on them are:

International: Abertay University (Dundee, Scotland), Undergrad & Grad

Mid-Atlantic: Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA), Undergrad & Grad

Midwest: Michigan State University (East Lansing), Undergrad & Grad

South: University of Central Florida (Orlando), Undergrad & Grad

Southwest: The University of Texas at Dallas, Undergrad

Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX), Grad

West: University of Southern California (Los Angeles), Undergrad & Grad

""The schools that made our lists for 2024 have awesome game design programs,"" said Rob Franek, The Princeton Review's Editor-in-Chief. ""Their faculties are superb. Their facilities are state-of-the-art, and their alumni include many of the industry's most successful game designers, developers, and entrepreneurs. We recommend them highly to all students aspiring to a career in this exciting field.""

Franek noted the exceptional game design experience students gain at the schools. Based on data from The Princeton Review's 2023 survey for the rankings:

While three-quarters of higher-education trustees (83%), faculty (81%) and administrators (76%) agree that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) will noticeably change their institutions in the next five years, community college trustees are more optimistic than their community college counterparts, with (37%) saying their organization is prepared for the change coming compared to just 16% of faculty and 11% of administrator respondents.

Those findings are from the 2023-2024 Digital Learning Pulse Survey conducted by Cengage and Bay View Analytics with support from the Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT), the Association of College and University Educators (ACUE), College Pulse and the United States Distance Learning Association (USDLA) to understand the attitudes and concerns of higher education instructors and leadership.

Education ranks among the top five industries expected to see a productivity boost from GenAI, with the sector forecast to see a revenue increase of as much as 4%. From answer bots and virtual tutors to gamified simulations in virtual reality for hands-on immersive learning, GenAI could be the remedy to ongoing challenges from teacher shortages and crowded classrooms to democratizing access to higher education through lower-cost options.

""While GenAI holds exciting potential, this survey signals that higher education has more work to do before it can fully realize its benefits,"" said Kimberly Russell, vice president of research for Cengage. ""Institutions and educational technology providers need to evaluate how to integrate GenAI equitably in a manner that can enrich human instruction and enable more personalized, captivating learning experiences that expand access and success for all students.""

In addition to a perceived lack of readiness to embrace GenAI in physical and virtual classrooms, the survey found many schools continue to seek creative solutions to declining enrollment, with more than a third (36%) of all administrators expressing an interest in offering more courses online and nearly half (47%) interested in additional hybrid offerings.

""This year's Digital Learning Pulse Survey suggests that GenAI could help solve some of the ongoing challenges faced by higher education,"" said Dr. Jeff Seaman, lead researcher and director of Bay View Analytics, which fielded the survey. ""However, the delta between the expected impact of GenAI in higher education and the current ability of these organizations to adapt to this new technology is significant. With so few respondents feeling prepared to adopt artificial intelligence, institutions will need to invest substantial time, effort and resources if they are to remain competitive as this technology becomes mainstream.""

Other survey findings include:

""GenAI offers promise for institutions of higher learning - especially two-year colleges - to expand their course offerings in modern, innovative ways,"" said Jee Hang Lee, president and CEO of ACCT, a national organization of community college leaders that helped organize the survey. ""We must, however, ensure equitable access and deliberate implementation so all students can benefit from this emerging technology in an inclusive environment that empowers their learning.""

The 2023-2024 Digital Learning Pulse Survey included partners ACCT, ACUE, College Pulse and USDLA.

Survey Methodology

These findings come from the Fall 2023 round of data collection of the Digital Learning Pulse Survey. Responses were received from 201 trustees at two-year schools, and 1,126 faculty and administrators and 2,229 students from two-year and four-year schools, representing more than 1,200 institutions from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.",ecampusnews.com,news,eCampus News,Kevin Hogan,0.2784313725490195,448665289,1,https://www.ecampusnews.com/files/2023/10/higher-education-innovation-meet-students-needs.jpeg,

Chiefs Inspect First Offshore Wind Turbine Vessel,"BROWNSVILLE, Texas - Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Dr. Steve Feldgus, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Director Elizabeth Klein and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) Deputy Director Paul Huang today toured Dominion Energy's wind turbine installation vessel Charybdis under construction at the Keppel AmFELS shipyard.

The Charybdis is slated to be the first U.S.-built and Jones Act-qualified offshore wind installation vessel. Currently under construction in Brownsville, Texas, the Charybdis used more than 14,000 tons of domestic steel, mostly sourced from Alabama, North Carolina and West Virginia.

When completed, the vessel will be based out of Hampton Roads, Virginia and operated by a U.S. crew. The installation vessel will support the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) commercial project, which the Interior Department approved in October 2023. The CVOW project will provide about 2,600 megawatts of clean, reliable offshore wind energy, capable of powering over 660,000 homes. The project is expected to provide about 900 jobs each year during the construction phase and support an estimated 1,100 annual jobs during the operations phase, generating vital economic development for Virginia's Hampton Roads area and supporting investments in the Virginia coastal region as a hub for offshore wind development and support.

The Charybdis is designed to be able to handle next generation wind energy turbine sizes of 14.7 megawatts and larger, with an anticipated construction completion by late 2024 or in 2025.

BSEE has been responsible for overseeing all stages of the CVOW commercial project's lease development and will continue to manage its construction and operations, including the 176 turbines that the Charybdis will be installing. Throughout the process, the project will remain under continual BSEE oversight to ensure the safe installation and commissioning of turbines, offshore substations, subsea cables, and all offshore energy facilities. Currently, BSEE is evaluating the wind turbine generator design and installation procedures to ensure they are suitable for withstanding the conditions off the coast of Virginia for the project's entire 33-year planned duration.

Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the Interior Department has approved the nation's first six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, with the first two offshore wind projects now generating commercial scale power. This historic progress helps support the Biden-Harris administration's goals to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy capacity by 2035.

BOEM has held four offshore wind lease auctions under Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland's leadership, which have brought in almost $5.5 billion in high bids to the U.S. Treasury, including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and New Jersey and the first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The Department has also advanced the process to explore additional opportunities for offshore wind energy development in the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Oregon and the Central Atlantic coast. The Department is applying its offshore energy expertise and knowledge to offshore wind to drive toward union-built projects that are safe for workers, environmentally sustainable, and rely on a domestic-based supply chain.

While in Texas, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Feldgus also attended the CERAWeek conference, where he highlighted how President Biden's Investing in America agenda is helping to streamline clean energy permitting processes and mapping critical minerals, which are essential for powering everything from household appliances and electronics to clean energy technologies like batteries and wind turbines.

The updated guidelines -- which go into effect for model year 2027 cars, and those hitting the roads through 2032 -- give a more relaxed pathway for carmakers to gradually reduce emissions.

Notably, the EPA says automakers can meet the emissions limits through a mixed sales approach based on the vehicle types. That includes traditional gasoline-powered cars, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). The agency's roadmap hinges on developments in the EV segment, alongside government benefits and increased local production facilities on U.S. soil.

""Proven technologies such as BEVs and PHEVs are already poised to become a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. fleet, as manufacturers continue to invest in these technologies and integrate them into product plans, and infrastructure continues to be developed,"" says the agency. While the overarching focus is on reducing greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM2.5), the EPA stresses the shift will benefit buyers.

""Once fully phased in, the standards will save the average American driver an estimated $6,000 in reduced fuel and maintenance over the life of a vehicle,"" the EPA said in a press statement. The agency touts savings worth $62 billion in annual fuel costs, and roughly $6,000 for an American car owner over the life of a vehicle.",slashgear.com,news,SlashGear,,0.2078431372549019,448662793,1,https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/how-bidens-new-electric-and-hybrid-rules-could-affect-the-next-car-you-buy/l-intro-1710963170.jpg,eng-9411264

It's due in U.S. showrooms in the second half of 2024 and pricing information will be announced closer to that on-sale date.

The latest GLC-Class arrived for the 2023 model year, initially with a sole GLC 300 grade powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 258 hp. The GLC 350e builds on the GLC 300 by adding an electric motor rated at 134 hp for a combined output of 313 hp.

A large battery whose capacity is 24.8 kwh means a decent electric range is possible. Mercedes estimates an electric range of 81 miles on the WLTP test cycle used overseas, though this would be lower when using the stricter EPA cycle. A full charge using a DC fast-charger will take around 30 minutes, Mercedes said.

In electric mode, the top speed is limited to 87 mph. The driver can select Electric mode using a drive mode selector. Also included is an Off-Road mode that enables the vehicle to travel on electric power alone even on off-road terrain.

Standard equipment includes all-wheel drive, a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, an 11.9-inch infotainment screen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless charging pad for smartphones, heated 16-way front seats with memory, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, ambient lighting, a powered tailgate, and a host of electronic driver-assist features.

The latest GLC-Class is also available with a coupe-like body style, but Mercedes hasn't said whether this option can be combined with the GLC 350e grade.

The latest GLC 63 from AMG is also a plug-in hybrid. Known as the GLC 63 S E Performance, it delivers up to 671 hp from a 2.0-liter turbo up front and a powerful electric motor at the rear.

And buyers willing to wait can look forward to an electric GLC-Class.

Gouba, chaired the opening ceremony of a national workshop devoted to the validation of the national rural electrification strategy in Burkina. It was in the company of the UNDP resident representative in Burkina, Alfredo Teixeira.

""By 2028, we aspire to a Burkina Faso where rural electrification is not a luxury, but a fundamental right for every citizen. A country where endogenous resources are wisely exploited, where a favorable legal and institutional framework attracts private investment.""

This is the vision pursued by this rural electrification project in Burkina, whose national strategy should be validated during this national workshop chaired by the minister in charge of energy, Yacouba Z. Gouba. A vision which is thus based, according to him, on national technical expertise capable of intervening in the field of rural electrification, while explaining that it is certainly ambitious, but achievable.

Read more about the electrification of rural areas in Burkina and find the most important economic news from around the world with the Born2Invest mobile app.

For the first head of the department in charge of energy, this rural electrification project is a historic opportunity to transform the energy reality of our country, to move from a rural electrification rate of only 5.49% to 2022 to 50% by 2028. He clarified that this is not just a quantified objective, but a stated desire and a commitment to our compatriots living in the most remote regions of our country. It is a desire to reduce inequalities, stimulate economic development and improve the quality of life of all our citizens, regardless of their geographical location, he said.

This national strategy aims, more specifically, to improve governance in the field of rural electrification, and to strengthen and sustain the rural production and distribution fleet. Added to this is also the strengthening of productive uses of electricity in rural areas and the technical capacities of the structures in charge of rural electrification.

These objectives were also cited by the deputy director of energy, Boubacar Thierry Ouédraogo, who also stressed that rural electrification cannot be considered in isolation. According to him, it must be integrated into a holistic approach to sustainable development with first the participation and empowerment of the beneficiary populations. This is why, he says, rural communities must be at the heart of the decision-making process and their needs, aspirations, as well as their knowledge must be fully integrated into the design and implementation of projects.

While wishing for fruitful exchanges and consultations with all stakeholders, the minister indicated that if the document is validated, it will become a road map and a compass towards a bright electrical future for the villages and rural communities of Burkina Faso.

Furthermore, the implementation of this National Rural Electrification Strategy (SNER) is estimated at 625 billion FCFA. It will make it possible to electrify 1,000 rural localities per year through the interconnected national network, mini green networks and individual systems, i.e. 5,000 localities for the next five years and to connect 1,200,000 new subscribers by 2028.

This major electrification project will be implemented thanks to the support of the UN agency UNDP, whose representative residing in Burkina Faso, Alfredo Teixeira, was present at the opening ceremony of the national validation workshop. He reassured of the support of his institution for the effective implementation of the said strategy.

CNPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previously, CNPC said it aims for a peak in its carbon emissions by around 2025, reaching near-zero emissions by 2050, a decade ahead of China's carbon neutrality target of 2060.

Among the charter's signatories are BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Aramco and ADNOC, which Al Jaber leads as chief executive.

Climate activists had criticised the summit being held in the United Arab Emirates, a leading oil exporter and member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

Jaber, who also chairs UAE renewable energy firm Masdar, said his background in all forms of energy was ultimately beneficial.

As significant improvements in EV technology continue in tandem with growing government support, the demand for electric vehicles has never been higher. However, amidst this drive for progress, one critical aspect that will require evolution of its own is thermal management.

In the CUI Insights™ blog post, Thermal Management for Next-Generation EV Charging, we will explore the critical importance of thermal management in electric vehicle charging applications.

For one, it is a made-for-TV event that will be broadcast Sunday at 12:30 p.m. ET on NBC, Peacock and the IndyCar Radio Network. There will also be two days of testing prior that will consist of nine hours in total and be streamed on Peacock.

While there will be limited fans in attendance, the majority of that contingent will be the wealthy club members; and there has been no secret in the aim to attract more of them to get involved in the series in some capacity, similar to Don Cusick, a partner in Dreyer & Reinbold Racing's Indianapolis 500 efforts.

Along with that, the massive $1.756 million purse is the largest for an IndyCar Series race outside of the Indianapolis 500. The winner of Sunday's 20-lap sprint race will take home $500,000, while the runner-up receives $350,000, third place $250,000 and fourth place $100,000. Fifth place will receive $50,000 with all other participants getting $23,000.

A field of 27 cars will be split into two groups to determine the starting grid for two heat races Sunday, with the top six finishers in each heat advancing to the final, which will feature two 10-lap segments. This will mark the first time since 2013 (Iowa Speedway) IndyCar has held heat races during an event.

""My take would be we don't know exactly what will be harvested from it, but as Don has said, others have said, it's a great connection to the members, which we'll see what comes of that,"" Miles said, during a media availability on Tuesday afternoon.

""It's on national television, so we have a chance to get maybe some new eyes looking at IndyCar that might not have absent the kind of unique format for this.

""I think people want to see us innovate. To do it in this way without the points on the line to us made sense. We're excited to see what comes of it.""

The facility, founded and owned by Tim Rogers and managed by his son, John Rogers, also hosted the IndyCar Series for a two-day Open Test ahead of the 2023 season.

The tricky thing to gauge is what the determining factor of this being a success or not is for Miles and the rest of IndyCar's leadership.

""I think we will have our ear to the ground with our key stakeholders,"" Miles said.

""First of all, I think the Rogers have to like it. It has to be a good experience for them as the owners of the club, and I'm sure that the club members' attitudes will be reflected in Tim Rogers' attitude. That's an important fundamental thing.

""I think we'll see how fans react. And you know, because you do it all the time, that you'll have a good sense from social media on the fan reaction to the racing.

""There will be some of our sponsors out there. Teams obviously. Team owners will be out there. We'll just take everybody's temperature after the fact.

""Listen, I just know the temperature is really in a good place after the test last year. People really enjoyed being there.""

When asked by Motorsport.com about the possibilities that exist if this is indeed becomes a successful event for all parties involved, noting the chances of it becoming a points race or increasing attendance to the general public, Miles remained non-committal.

""The scenario you hypothesize, we hope accurately, was that this is phenomenally successful this weekend,"" Miles said.

""I hope that's the case. Kind of expect that to be the case.

""Then we'll just sit down and work through it. The last part of your question was sort of about the gate, the crowd. We really have to do some thinking about that. The club wasn't built for, pick a number, 20,000 spectators at an event.

""What we do know is that the paddock, the teams, and the drivers love it, so I think there will be interest in being there. Exactly in what form going forward is something we have to analyze and discuss amongst ourselves and with the Rogers and perhaps input from the members after this weekend.""",motorsport.com,news,Motorsport.com,,0.1686274509803922,448657358,1,https://cdn-8.motorsport.com/images/amp/24v37az6/s6/scott-dixon-chip-ganassi-racin.jpg,eng-9411275

""To deliver, the federal government needs to make it fast and easy for companies to access the clean energy investment tax credits or they risk falling further behind the U.S. and other major economies.

The refineries set to remain profitable are those that have already invested in petrochemical integration, Kuwait state-owned refiner Kipic's corporate planning manager Abdullah Al-Ossaimi said during the panel.

A spate of further challenges face the industry. More stringent emissions requirements for transportation fuels, geopolitical unrest and the pressure to invest in step with the energy transition are top of mind for Al-Ossaimi.

Kipic commissioned the final units of it 615,000 b/d Al Zour refinery in Kuwait late last year, one of the largest refinery builds in recent years after narrow margins in the pandemic-era contributed to multiple refinery closures.

The Al Zour plant has successfully tested running at maximum capacity for several weeks since late last year and is planning to test various crude slates over the next four to five months, Al-Ossaimi said.

Larger-scale refineries like Al Zour could have a greater chance of remaining profitable in an uncertain demand environment.

""The refineries that I think are going to be more successful...are larger, they're integrated and they're much more digitally enabled,"" Schneider Electric's senior vice president of power systems Chris Dartnell said on the panel.

The ""bold electric vehicle vision"" in Europe is that gasoline demand could be down 90pc by 2050, Dartnell said, but ""there's another equally valid school of thought that says biofuels come and are accepted and could be rebranded as bio gasoline.""",argusmedia.com,news,Argus Media,,0.1450980392156862,448653273,1,,

This service will be of particular interest for organizations with a multinational footprint and multinational data-sovereignty concerns.

In the following sections, I'll dig deeper into Oracle's announcement and explain why this service could yield significant cost savings and operational improvements for IT organizations.

While data has been the fuel that drives the modern business, it is also a major challenge that enterprise IT must account for. We all understand the criticality -- and complexity -- of data privacy and integrity issues. However, we don't all understand how much more complex and costly this becomes at a multinational level. Local laws and regulations around data sovereignty, privacy and survivability are just that: local. The nuanced language and requirements that apply from one country to the next require so much effort, attention and (local) resources to manage.

In fact, to adhere to localized data requirements, organizations will hire entire teams of data professionals -- legal, operational and technical -- to ensure adherence to both internal and external requirements. Additionally, entire infrastructure deployments are often used to guarantee that there is no daylight between what is required by regulations and what is delivered by the responsible organization.

Why do companies invest so much time and effort in adhering to local data privacy and sovereignty rules? Because not adhering is bad business. Pretty simple, right? Failing to adequately protect customer and company data is just wrong. It impacts the business both directly and indirectly, including through fines, bad press, lower stock prices, revenue loss and so on. As one example among many, in 2021 Amazon was fined roughly $840 million for violating the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.

To achieve data sovereignty, many multinational companies have employed database sharding. In simple terms, this no-share architecture uses a partitioning process by which a database is essentially carved into smaller and separate parts. Each shard is a physical database and runs independently of other shards (databases) in this environment. So, the data in India is unique to India and stays in India, while that shard is still connected to the larger global database environment and the data can be accessed from anywhere. Why is this important? It enables organizations to set and enforce policies and practices around data privacy, sovereignty and the like on a shard-by-shard -- that is, country-by-country -- basis.

While sharding is an effective way to build a distributed database environment, there can be downsides. The first is application performance, or latency. If an application request originating in the U.S. calls on data from a shard in India, it will require more time for that data to be retrieved. For a local request, performance will be better.

The second downside is complexity, which can impact scale. As more shards are created, the amount of cross-shard SQL increases considerably. This creates more overhead and can, at some point, become a detriment to performance and manageability.

Sharding is essential to the distributed nature of Oracle's Globally Distributed Autonomous Database, which operates as one big logical database that maps to multiple physical databases (shards) where local data is stored. Each shard is replicated for survivability, and shards run in an active-active mode, meaning that all shards process application requests.

Any database professional who has used or managed Oracle's Real Applications Clusters database understands that the scale-out capabilities developed for that clustered database deliver top-notch performance. For its implementation of the new distributed database, Oracle built on top of local RAC and Autonomous Database capabilities so that each shard can be easily and independently scaled up to achieve high performance, and then scaled back down to manage cloud consumption costs. The result is a distributed database that enjoys the scale, redundancy and sovereignty associated with sharding combined with the performance and local fault tolerance you would expect from the RAC and Autonomous Database products.

When combined with application-transparent access to the sharded database, these capabilities enable applications to run with high relational database performance and without changes. In short, Oracle's Globally Distributed Autonomous Database helps customers reduce complexity while addressing their data residency, performance and availability goals.

This is also important as it differentiates Oracle's offering from many of the distributed database offerings on the market, as those competing offerings are built on NoSQL. Oracle's approach capitalizes on its decades of experience delivering high-performance, mission-critical relational databases that meet ACID requirements for full consistency. The NoSQL approach, by contrast, introduces a number of data consistency challenges as well as providing reporting and analytics that simply fall flat in a distributed deployment. In fact, many NoSQL vendors appear to be trying to add SQL on top of a NoSQL engine, while others are trying to support distributed scale-out. Neither of these fixes is trivial, and they will probably take years to achieve.

One of the keys to effective distributed database environments is data distribution across shards. This is another area where Oracle has differentiated itself from the competition by enabling different distribution methods based on each organization's needs. Distribution is also managed automatically based on policies defined by the user. For example, organizations may want to distribute data based on country of origin to address data residency concerns, use a hash distribution for scalability and parallelism, employ user-defined distributions to address data-specific skews or even replicate tables that are heavily read-oriented to every shard for the sake of efficient database operations. In fact, Oracle allows customers to flexibly combine these and other approaches to match their specific needs.

Additionally, Globally Distributed Autonomous Database offers the widest variety of replication methods -- synchronous, asynchronous, adaptive synchronous or a combination. Finally, Oracle seems to have analyzed every option when considering how and where shards are deployed -- regular servers, fault-tolerant scalable clusters, in the cloud or multiple clouds. All of these options give organizations maximum flexibility for deployment and use of Globally Distributed Autonomous Database.

With all of the work that Oracle has put into its Globally Distributed Database product over the years, the big news is that everything described here is available as an autonomous cloud service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as through on-premises deployment via Exadata Cloud@Customer or Dedicated Region. Each shard is treated as an Autonomous Database by adding Globally Distributed Database capabilities to Autonomous Database. This means that each shard is elastic, auto-managed, auto-scaled, auto-tuned and auto-patched. While it may sound overly simplistic to say that organizations can ""deploy and forget"" with this service, practically speaking it's true.

When all of the capabilities outlined above in terms of scale, data provisioning and the like are combined with the capabilities of Oracle's Autonomous Database in OCI, it creates a distributed database solution unlike anything else on the market.

One of the very cool capabilities that Autonomous Database brings into the equation is what Oracle calls Select AI. This tool essentially converts simple text questions into SQL statements for execution and enables conversational threads. In Globally Distributed Autonomous Database, the query is automatically routed to the appropriate country or shard to generate the answers. This is a powerful capability for organizations focused on enabling business users, because users no longer need to know either how their data is laid out or where it's physically located.

As somebody who learned and used SQL*Plus and PL/SQL, this kind of feels wrong as it takes away the power of being a nerd. But in all seriousness, Select AI is a stroke of genius that empowers all users to make the best use of data.

It is a little too simplistic to say that deploying your global data estate with Distributed Global Autonomous Database is as easy as pointing and clicking. However, it does make it far simpler to navigate the ever-changing regulatory landscape of individual countries and manage those individual data environments (shards). What once required a team of database specialists working in concert with legal and operational experts can now be performed centrally and from a single console.

As an ex-IT leader who had to manage a team of database specialists for dozens of state agencies, I fully understand the organizational and operational challenges that appear on the radar day after day. Adding the challenges associated with sovereignty, redundancy and performance across a number of countries? Forget it. Faced with that reality, my first order of business would be reducing cost and complexity -- and that would lead me to look for a solution like Globally Distributed Autonomous Database.

Oracle's Globally Distributed Database delivers a breadth and depth of functionality that can come only from servicing the data needs of the enterprise for decades. This is what makes this solution stand out in the market: it's the understanding of how data is used and managed around the globe that translates into features and capabilities that other vendors simply haven't thought of or achieved.

By enabling this as an Autonomous Database service, the company further addresses what enterprise organizations want and need as their data estates grow to span the globe. Add in new AI-enabled capabilities, and this becomes a modernized data platform for the modern organization running modern applications.

I'll be keeping a close eye on how Globally Distributed Autonomous Database lands with customers, so check here soon for more insights.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,0.2156862745098038,448651177,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65fb135d542ee1ca50e239e5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,

The fediverse has accumulated a population of just over 13 million users and over 18,000 servers, according to Fediverse Party.

Threads has been testing compatibility with the fediverse since the end of last year as the social media giant slowly moves towards its interoperability promise.

Instagram chief, Adam Mosseri assured that Threads would eventually be made compatible with ActivityPub, before it was released.

ActivityPub is an open, decentralised social networking protocol used to connect platforms in the fediverse.

Peter Cottle, a Threads engineer, shared a demonstration of how Threads users can access the fediverse and some disclaimers to bear in mind.

""We have 130 million people using [Threads], but a lot of people haven't heard of the fediverse, and don't know what ActivityPub is,"" Colter explained in the demo.

""But we want to give them the ability to enter that type of experience.""

Threads will inform users that their profiles must be public to enable the feature.

Users are also warned that deleting a post on Threads does not guarantee deletion elsewhere in the fediverse -- though well-behaving nodes should honour deletion requests.

Threads will offer a five-minute window to delete after posting.

When a user has activated Fediverse Sharing, a planet symbol will appear next to their profile.

This will indicate to other fediverse users that interacting with the post will appear across the fediverse.

Currently, only certain accounts have access to Fediverse Sharing, including Mosseri, whose posts can be viewed on Mastodon, the largest fediverse platform.

The fediverse is an ensemble of several open, decentralised social media platforms boasting interoperability between one another.

The name ""fediverse"" is a combination of ""federal"" and ""universe"".

Instead of each platform having set rules and policies that all have to adhere to, each platform is divided into servers created by users who set their own community standards.

These servers are called instances or nodes and are interconnected (or ""federated""), allowing users to determine their own social media experience while still being able to view posts by users on other instances.",mybroadband.co.za,news,MyBroadband,Daniel Puchert,0.2078431372549019,448648763,1,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Threads-Instagram-Facebook-Meta-Platforms-by-Koshiro-K-Shutterstock.jpg,eng-9415307

Available for $349.50, the Scanwatch 2 can detect potential health problems, assess your respiratory system, and of course, provide you with health and activity metrics. I've had mine for about a month, and I have been impressed with everything the Scanwatch 2 has to offer. Keep reading below the fold to learn more.

Right out of the box, the smaller 38mm Scanwatch 2 looked sleek with its pearl white analog watch face that has physical hands and beveled lugs. There is a small digital grayscale OLED display on the top half of the Scanwatch 2 that, by default shows the date and time, but when you press the watch's crown, you can sift through a host of other display options and information, including heart rate, temperature, steps taken, miles walked, floors climbed, menstrual cycle tracking, workouts, ECG or Sp02 measurement, a breathing companion, alarm and stopwatch settings, and Scanwatch 2 settings.

That's a whole lot of information for one person, and personally, I don't use half of those features - the only display features I use are for the date, steps taken that day, heart rate, and tracking my physical activity via the workout option. That said, it's nice that the other options exist.

While it took me a few days to acclimate to the Scanwatch 2 after having had my Apple Watch in its place for over a year, it was an easy enough transition. You get used to the different vibrations and alerts in the same way you would with any wearable, and I appreciate that the Scanwatch 2 looks classy in its design - at a distance, you wouldn't know it was a smartwatch.

The only immediate con I noticed of the Scanwatch 2 has to do with its notifications, which run across the digital display in the same way headlines run across the bottom of a news program, like a ticker tape, which means that when a text comes through, it can take a long time to read it.

Along with this being my first smartwatch experience outside of an Apple Watch, it was also my first time experiencing the Withings app. I found it to be extremely comprehensive and impressive, housing all sorts of helpful information, including goals I set out to achieve and ways to accomplish them, my physical activity, my trends, my cycle tracking, and more.

What I like most about the Withings app and its connection to the Scanwatch 2 is how quickly the data aggregates and synthesizes to give you new information, such as ways in which to accomplish the goals you've set out to achieve. For example, I had said I wanted to lose five pounds, and the app provided me with ways in which to accomplish that specific goal. If I were to change the goal, the app would accommodate me, providing me with tools to help guide me along the way.

There are some features within the app, however, that can only be unlocked with a Withings+ subscription, such as its Build Better Sleep Habits six-week program or the Hypertension education program. Most health tracking apps have both a free and a subscription tier, and Withings' free tier far surpasses other health and wellness apps that I've tried in terms of what's available without having to pay a monthly fee.

The Scanwatch 2 features a stainless steel case, sapphire glass, and a stainless steel crown that double as a navigational tool for its digital display. There is a TempTech24/7 Module that tracks your body temperature, highlighting how it changes from day to night and while you're working out, and even alerting you to a possible incoming illness.

It's water-resistant, has up to a 30-day battery life (which I found to be nearly exactly accurate), takes two hours to charge, is USB-C compatible, and connects with Bluetooth Low Energy.

For $349.50, you get a lot of bang for your buck by utilizing the Scanwatch 2 and its compatible Withings app. If you are someone who has health concerns or whose health data dictates how they navigate their day, then this is the watch for you because there is nothing you can't do with this hybrid smartwatch, and it provides you with a wealth of data to keep you healthy.

If, however, you're someone like me who is only interested in the fitness compatibility piece of a smartwatch, then my suggestion would be to stick with a simpler wearable like an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. Sometimes when a piece of technology offers a lot of data and options it overwhelms me, and so I go back to what I know, using only the information that I need.",9to5toys.com,news,9to5Toys,Laura Rosenberg,0.0117647058823529,448648702,1,https://i0.wp.com/9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/03/scanwatch2.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&ssl=1,

The new rules relax initial tailpipe limits proposed last year but eventually get close to the same strict standards set out by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The rules come as sales of electric vehicles, which are needed to meet the standards, have begun to slow. The auto industry cited lower sales growth in objecting to the EPA's preferred standards unveiled last April as part of its ambitious plan to cut planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles.

The EPA said that under its final rule, the industry could meet the limits if 56% of new vehicle sales are electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, as well as more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.

The new standards will avoid more than 7 billion tons of planet-warming carbon emissions over the next three decades and provide nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits, the EPA said, including lower health care costs, fewer deaths and more than $60 billion in reduced annual costs for fuel, maintenance and repairs.

WHAT IS EPA PROPOSING?

The EPA rule applies to model years 2027 to 2032 and will significantly reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as well as other air pollution such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks and pickups. The rule will help ""tackle the climate crisis"" and result in widespread reductions in air pollution while accelerating the adoption of cleaner vehicle technologies, the EPA said. The agency is finalizing the rule as sales of clean vehicles, including plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, hit record highs last year.

The new rule slows implementation of stricter pollution standards from 2027 through 2029, after the auto industry called proposed benchmarks unworkable. The rule ramps up to nearly reach the level the EPA preferred by 2032.

""Let me be clear: Our final rule delivers the same, if not more, pollution reduction than we set out in our proposal,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters. In addition to carbon pollution, the final standards also will reduce other serious air pollution that contributes to heart attacks, respiratory illnesses, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function, Regan said.

""Folks, these new standards are so important for public health, for American jobs, for our economy and for our planet,"" he said.

The standards are designed to be technology-neutral and performance-based, Regan said, giving car and truck manufacturers the flexibility to choose pollution-control technologies that are best suited for their customers while meeting environmental and public health goals.

WHY DID EPA CHANGE THE PROPOSED RULE?

The changes appear aimed at addressing strong industry opposition to the accelerated ramp-up of EVs, along with public reluctance to fully embrace the new technology. There is also a legitimate threat of legal challenges before conservative courts.

The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted the EPA's authority to fight air and water pollution - including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.

President Joe Biden has made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency and is seeking to slash carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, which make up the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

At the same time, the Democratic president needs cooperation from the auto industry and political support from auto workers, a key political voting bloc. The United Auto Workers union, which has endorsed Biden, has said it favors the transition to electric vehicles but wants to make sure jobs are preserved and that the industry pays top wages to workers who build the EVs and batteries.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that White House officials ""don't have any concerns"" about the final EPA rule. ""We know, with these types of things, it takes time,'' she told reporters. ""But we're still going to stay committed to our (climate) goals.""

Interests: comparative political science; quality of democracy; knowledge; knowledge democracy and knowledge economy; higher education systems; innovation; art and arts (artistic research)

The focus of this Special Issue is on cross-disciplinary discussions that reflect the ongoing and rapidly increasing societal, economic, and democratic transformations. These transitions are being driven by interconnections between environmental, political, and technological changes. There is a need to understand the broader systemic effects. The results are concepts such as knowledge democracy and innovation democracy, and an interest in applying governance for their implementation.

The currently arising global challenges include shifts in labor, work, and education, the need for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in artistic and scientific research in order to promote democracy and the quality of democracy, fostering new socially creative environments, addressing climate change and global warming, enhancing gender relations and other references of equality, addressing implications of an aging society, managing migration, governing digital transformation and artificial intelligence, understanding the impact of technology on society and the economy and democracy, fostering future innovation, embracing new economic models, and activating art for societal transformation.

These radical transformation and transition processes will have far-reaching consequences for the sciences, arts, society, economy, and democracy. To elevate these challenges into productive solutions, we must broaden our understanding and adopt interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to reflective thinking, profound problem-solving, and the making of sustainable decisions.

Federal assistance continues to add up for victims of storms, tornadoes and flooding last August.

In just over a month since the Biden White House declared a major disaster for Michigan following severe weather last August, FEMA says more than

$105 million in federal assistance so far has been doled out to help with recovery.

Homeowners and renters whose homes and property were damaged by last summer's storms have until April 8 to apply for federal assistance.

As of March 19, Michigan's recovery assistance includes:

§ More than $103.1 million in FEMA's Individual and Households Program (IHP) grants awarded to eligible homeowners and renters in nine Michigan counties. These grants help pay for uninsured and underinsured losses and storm-related damage, including:

o More than $83.1 million in FEMA housing grants to help pay for home repair, home replacement and rental assistance for temporary housing.

o More than $19.9 million in Other Needs Assistance grants to help pay for personal property replacement and other serious storm-related needs-such as moving and storage fees, transportation, childcare, and medical and dental expenses.

§ More than $2.2 million in long-term, low-interest disaster loans from the SBA for homeowners and renters to help repair, rebuild or replace disaster-damaged physical property and to cover economic injury for businesses of all sizes and non-profit organizations.

The nine Michigan counties designated for Individual Assistance in this disaster are: Eaton, Ingham, Ionia, Kent, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland and Wayne.

The state and FEMA have staffed and operated 15 Disaster Recovery Centers in the nine designated counties that provide one-on-one assistance to survivors. The centers have tallied more than 1,270 visits by survivors.

Recovery specialists from FEMA, state and the U.S. Small Business Administration at the recovery centers provide information on available services, explain assistance programs, and help survivors complete or check the status of their applications for assistance. No appointment is necessary to visit a Disaster Recovery Center. Walk-ins are welcome. All centers are open 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. All centers are closed Sundays.

To find locations of all open recovery centers, visit FEMA.gov/DRC. You may visit any center for assistance.

The easiest way to reach FEMA is to call the toll-free Helpline at 800-621-3362. Specialists are available 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. to help you apply, answer your questions and provide referrals to resources. Language translation is available.

If you use a relay service such as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, give FEMA your number for that service when you apply.

Weather and Drone as First Responder: Scalable DFR Requires Trusted Digital Weather Services

Drone as First Responder (DFR) programs, in which a remote pilot in command (RPIC) can instantly activate a drone in response to a 911 call to provide incident awareness and assessment before first responder deployment, has taken hold. Many public safety agencies have these programs. Those who don't have them, want them.

With advances in technology, DFR will soon transition to the point where one RPIC will remotely fly several drones, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). These changes to operational constructs demand a related evolution in weather monitoring methods.

This past week, at the DRONERESPONDERS National Public Safety UAS Conference, an expert panel took the stage to discuss how to exploit weather to achieve more flight time, while maintaining the highest level of safety. Led by moderator Don Berchoff, CEO of TruWeather Solutions, the all-star panelists (Chris Zarzar, TruWeather's Director Strategy and innovation; John Eberhardt, Managing Director at ATA Aviation; Dave Cameron, Field Engineer, City of Campbell DFR Program Manager for MatrixSpace; and Tyler Willhite, NASA Aerospace Engineer) agreed: scalable DFR requires trusted digital weather services.

Weather Impacts DFR

DFR removes first responders from the heat of the moment (sometimes literally, in the case of firefighters). It enhances awareness of the situation, defuses potentially hazardous scenarios and safeguards public safety officers and the community. Public safety organizations can only realize the full benefits of DFR if they can actually launch their drones. Weather, in particular micro weather conditions, can sometimes get in the way.

Micro weather, localized atmospheric conditions, can vary significantly over small distances. These conditions can be influenced by factors such as terrain (e.g., buildings in a city), bodies of water, fields or vegetation growth (e.g. forests). Micro weather may cause mission-critical variations in temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, cloud cover and precipitation. For DFR RPICs, these micro weather conditions can significantly differ from those reported at airports and have a profound impact on operational decision-making. (See, e.g., this study on micro weather in North Carolina).

Setting A New Standard

Today, aviators can only use approved government sources of weather data from certified instruments which have undergone rigorous certification and validation processes. One of these systems, expensive Automated Weather Systems (ASOS) at airports, help inform the Meteorological Terminal Air Reports (METARs) used by all pilots.These sources do not take microclimates, specifically measurements below 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL), into account. (See

Berchoff questioned this status quo: ""Why should RPICs have to decode a METAR? METAR codes were invented when we had a teletype. And the approved weather sources that feed into the METAR right now are not granular enough for drone operations.""

However, deploying strategically placed low-cost supplementary sensors to conduct comprehensive area monitoring could provide localized data to access key parameters, such cloud height and visibility.

""Great sensor technology is out there - something between an ASOS and a wind sock,"" Berchoff explained. ""There are plenty of reliable lower cost sensor technologies out there. We had to get the rules changed.""

For several years, Berchoff led the ASTM-38 Working Group which ultimately approved a new performance-based Weather Supplemental Data Service Provider (SDSP) specification. This new standard allows for the use of these sensors, contingent on a science-driven reliability case, without the need for traditional certification processes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which endorsed this initiative, is developing an Advisory Circular (AC) to implement it.

Harnessing the Data

Working with other industry partners, the FAA and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), TruWeather Solutions continues to test and demonstrate new sensor capabilities under waivers in controlled environments to fill in current data gaps at lower altitudes.

Utilizing the new ASTM weather standard, TruWeather and its partners now leverage the FAA's recently introduced Near Term Application Process (NTAP). NTAP streamlines approval procedures by providing pre-designed templates for various use cases. This expedited approval process extends to third-party weather providers and other service providers in Uncrewed Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM).

""We continue to compile a comprehensive package encompassing diverse weather sensor applications tailored to different operational scenarios. By aligning our chosen weather solutions with the new standard and innovative sensors, operators can utilize them under this waiver,"" Berchoff explained.

One project that leverages these authorities, a NASA-funded Urban Weather Sensing Infrastructure Testbed initiative in Hampton, Virginia, aims to provide detailed low altitude weather data and forecast services. It involves use of both ground-based weather sensor systems and two cutting-edge doppler LiDARs.

A System of Systems

To be most effective, DFR systems must be scalable and cover large areas, resilient and cost-effective. A system-of-systems approach, which incorporates weather and other related sensors, makes this best achievable.

ATA's Eberhardt has produced the Flight Information Exchange (FIX), data networks for government agencies and the public, which creates a mesh of relatively inexpensive sensors that complement each other. He explained, ""If you want to become an advanced capable system to respond, it takes an orchestration of capabilities. We can roll out a half dozen or dozen surveillance and weather sensors and put them all together as a public network to cover a wider area and share it across agencies. Then everyone has the same picture. This also provides more resilience. If three break, nine still work.""

Cameron of MatrixSpace, who runs a DFR program in California, added, ""With TruWeather, we've already started creating this digital observer system-of-systems. You can join this ecosystem to use a wide range of integrated local sensors and data systems that include weather sensors, optical, radar and ADS-B. This can help build your safety case for the FAA. The best path to DFR and BVLOS program approval is to tap into an integrated system of systems.""

Tapping into the New Paradigm

Public safety organizations can benefit from the efforts of TruWeather's ever-growing weather resilience consortium now. According to TruWeather's Zarzar, ""We are submitting a package to use various weather sensors for different operations including surveillance, DFR, drone-in-a-box (DIB) and BVLOS. Then operators can use them under our NTAP waiver."" This will allow public safety organizations and TruWeather to test these sensors and provide data to the FAA to move the AC forward.

""It's a win-win-win,"" exclaimed Zarzar. ""We are going to be able to use these technologies before the AC has been released and everyone will be able to take advantage of this.""

Eberhardt chimed in, ""And it doesn't have to break the bank. Mixed mode networks drop costs dramatically.""

""Each individual piece is budget dust,"" Berchoff noted. ""The biggest expense for DFR is for the drone-in-a-box. All you are doing is building capabilities around that.""

Making the Case

At the end of the day, public safety needs to fly during emergency situations. Period.

Harnessing the data from advanced weather sensors can enhance situational awareness for operators beyond conventional METAR reports. New standards and streamlined regulatory processes have paved the way to use new weather sources, using cutting-edge technology. Access to comprehensive weather data, and other networked sensors, helps operators anticipate and navigate potential challenges, such as adverse wind conditions or sudden precipitation. This results in more informed decision-making and ensures safe operations, even in emergency situations, to guarantee mission success.

""You can get to calls faster for DFR if you use prevailing tailwinds,"" Cameron said, ""This is how you need to start using the power of accurate digital weather observation data to your advantage.""

""On the other hand,"" Berchoff joined in, ""what are those headwinds going to do to you? How long is it going to take you to get to the incident? What happens when you get there and experience moderate rain?"" Ultimately, he said, it's the responsibility of the RPIC to be ready for any condition, to achieve mission success.

Leveraging the power of more accurate weather data aids in truly understanding weather conditions, provides higher levels of confidence for planning and bolsters operational safety of flight.

""We all need to think about weather in a new way to make DFR scalable,"" Berchoff said. ""Reach out to us. We have world experts tackling this problem for you.""

Banking conferences today look a lot different than they did just five years ago. Technology is transforming these events, allowing them to reach audiences at scale and become more accessible than ever before. With the help of event platform technology, virtual and hybrid events are now the new standard.

As banking conference planners increasingly take advantage of advanced technology to deliver both virtual and hybrid events, their primary challenge is how to create a standout event that engages participants no matter where they are.

Here are five tried and true strategies that will help event planners overcome this challenge and deliver seamless and engaging virtual and hybrid conferences:

To keep both on-site and virtual event attendees engaged, include time throughout the program for interaction. Virtual event platforms like GlobalMeet, provide opportunities for participants to interact through audience chat, polling and surveys and participate in interactive breakout sessions.

To create a steady stream of interaction, digital event platforms allow virtual and in-person attendees to submit questions to an on-site moderator. They also allow an on screen virtual moderator to identify virtual attendees by name and have them ask their question themselves. This can increase interaction from virtual attendees and boost their engagement in the conference.

Many people attend banking events for the opportunity to network. Technology can help conference organizers facilitate networking through breakout sessions in smaller virtual meeting rooms, virtual meet-ups and virtual ice breakers. In-event apps allow in-person and virtual attendees to network and make appointments with exhibitors and other attendees.

Today, AI-matchmaker technology can even help attendees find and connect with other attendees who share similar interests and/or professional backgrounds. Using advanced algorithms, AI can quickly analyze vast amounts of attendee profile data to strategically match attendees, enabling networking opportunities that facilitate meaningful connections and enhance the overall event experience.

Content is foundational to keeping both in-person and virtual conference participants interested and engaged. To keep content engaging and make it more visually appealing for all attendees, incorporate video clips, images, and dynamic graphics.

Engagement is also enhanced by accessible, inclusive conference experiences. Event organizers can use automated captions and on-screen interpreters to ensure content can be delivered to everyone in the audience.

With hybrid and virtual events, conference organizers have access to a wealth of event data. Digital event platforms with integrated analytical data and reporting features are great tools to help event organizers understand what worked and what didn't. Organizers can use these features to analyze audience preferences, behaviors, and engagement patterns. The comprehensive analytics functionality embedded in digital event platforms provides a snapshot of the entire event lifecycle which can tell conference organizers what worked well, what can be improved and what should be repeated. All of this data can be used to optimize the time, date, and format of future events to drive better interest and engagement.

Robust, user-friendly digital event platform solution providers can help make conference participation easy and engaging for all participants regardless of location. It is important for banking conference organizers to select an event management technology built for the enterprise that can be deployed seamlessly and securely. Some of the key features banking event planners should look for in digital event technology include:

The March 24 exhibition event (the first for IndyCar since Surfers Paradise, Australia in 2008) will feature a purse of $1.756 million, the largest for an IndyCar race outside of the Indy 500 in the past 20 years.

In an all star-style format, the winner of the Sprint for the Purse will receive $500,000. Saturday's two heat races (used for the first time by IndyCar since 2013) will set the 12-car field for Sunday's 20-lap main event (which also will feature a halftime break).

The Thermal Club is a 490-acre property near Palm Springs that has been billed as a motorsports country club of sorts.

IndyCar held a preseason test last year on the 17-turn, 3-mile road course with Colton Herta, Marcus Ericsson and Christian Lundgaard among the fastest drivers over four sessions. But with several fresh driver and team combinations for the 2024 IndyCar season (as well as cars that are 25 pounds lighter), there will be many new variables for this weekend in the desert.

Despite no points at stake, this will mark the second race weekend of the IndyCar season. Josef Newgarden won the season opener as Chevrolets dominated the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

The next points race will be the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach on April 21.

Rosbank board chairman Nikolai Sidorov on Wednesday said the most obvious benefit from the two banks integrating would come from combing their retail businesses on Tinkoff's platform.

Tinkoff Bank owner TCS Holding, controlled by Potanin's Interros group, is seeking to integrate Rosbank into the holding to increase its share of Russia's financial market.

Potanin's Interros, one of the most powerful private investment companies in Russia, bought a controlling stake in Rosbank from France's Societe Generale (EPA:SOGN) in 2022, followed by a 35% stake in TCS from businessman Oleg Tinkov.

Potanin said the banking group's future was still being discussed but that both lenders would retain their licences, brands and teams, with Rosbank continuing to focus on corporate and private clients and Tinkoff looking to expand its 40-million-strong retail client base.

""This is the very situation in which one plus one gives more than two,"" Potanin was quoted as saying by Interros.

TCS Holding's board of directors has decided to initiate a buyback of up to 19 million of its own shares on the market, representing about 10% of the company's share capital, it said last week.

On Wednesday, the holding's board proposed issuing an additional 130 million shares at 3,423.62 roubles per piece, with a shareholder meeting set for May 8.

And as told by Ryan Gerbrandt, Chief Operating Officer at Anterix, broadband technology at utilities is uniquely poised to drive innovation and future-readiness to the next level.

While sitting at the centrally located booth that Anterix attained during the recent Distributech 2024 Conference in Orlando, Gerbrandt pointed directly to the neighboring companies with booths of their own, some of which would ostensibly be considered competition but which he saw as peers, collaborators, and key participants in a 'rising tides' approach that he finds will bring the landscape of the digital utility to new levels. Indeed, the Anterix Active Ecosystem includes more than 100 technology innovators whose products and services are enabling utilities to achieve their grid modernization goals via 900 MHz private wireless broadband networks.

""Modern solutions are not going to be single-vendor and vertically integrated like they used to be. ""his shift fuels our commitment to fostering collaboration and partnerships across the ecosystem."" - Ryan Gerbrandt

At Distributech, Anterix's COO emphasized the role of collaboration in driving progress and highlighted numerous opportunities for flexible and innovative utilities, particularly those leveraging broadband technologies his company is championing.

Reflecting during the final day at Distributech, Gerbrandt noted that the dramatic evolution of utility technologies showcased at the conference represents a vital pathway as the sector addresses new risks and opportunities. Naturally, he saw the prominent role of telecommunications in transforming the grid, with broadband being paramount among them. Compared with previous years at the conference, according to Gerbrandt, telecommunications had finally taken the main stage at Distributech 2024, including an entire speaking track focus. That focus confirms not only the urgency felt by the broader industry, but the buy-in that the utility leaders are seeing themselves.

Overall, the conversations at Distributech confirmed a growing recognition of the critical role that wireless broadband plays in addressing major issues faced by today's digital, flexible, and distributed energy industry: driving the next generation of smart meters, enabling the growth of distributed energy resources, mapping flexibility and demand-response needs, and so much more. ""It underscores the maturation of our understanding of the pivotal role that broadband plays,"" Gerbrandt confirms, ""and it highlights the fundamental and critical expansion of broadband's significance in addressing the defining issues we encounter in the energy industry.""

Anterix's Distributech showcase overflowed with modern broadband solutions, demonstrating how telecommunications is now central, not peripheral, to the utility industry's advancement. Gerbrandt pointed to more than 40 categories for private networks distributed in Anterix's booth, spanning physical and cybersecurity, resilience, clean energy, grid edge, metering, and wildfire mitigation.

And while that abundance of use cases may sound like a lot, Gerbrandt called it intentionally comprehensive. ""Our goal,"" he stated, ""is to create a solution that fully immerses utility participants in our offerings,"" spanning across the Anterix booth.

Overview of 900 MHz private wireless broadband at the Anterix booth

A specific example comes from utilities' need for technologies to assist with wildfire mitigation. After seeing too many risks, disasters, and costs, California utilities have gone all-in on identifying the tools that can help prevent wildfires. As a key example, Gerbrandt and his team have been working with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) from the laboratory to the field journey of being able to de-energize falling lines before they risk igniting nearby vegetation. Thanks to this innovative technology, SDG&E has now seen a line fall and become de-energized in less than 1.5 seconds, a landmark achievement in preventing wildfires.

Regardless of the specific use case, digital infrastructure plays a key role in any vital utility operation today.

""Whether addressing wildfires, resiliency, cybersecurity, or the clean energy transition, if I don't have the right digital infrastructure in place, it becomes very complicated."" - Ryan Gerbrandt

From the opening keynote to speaking tracks to the demonstrations on the conference floor, attendees were inundated with messages about how artificial intelligence, or AI, was a dominant theme this year. And while previous Distributech conferences would feature some overarching, forward-looking discussions of the role of AI, this year's gathering demonstrated quite clearly that most utilities and their vendors are studying how and where to implement AI as soon as possible.

While Gerbrandt agreed that the possibilities in the future with AI indeed are exciting, and that these are tools the Anterix team will continue to integrate and embrace, he noted that the industry, at least today, may need to stop short of calling it a complete AI takeover. While AI and machine learning are gaining traction in the industry, there is still uncertainty about their practical applications in utility operations, with Gerbrandt confirming that it all starts with data and getting that right first:

""Anything AI or machine learning, or even analytics, requires tracing back and ensuring you have reliable and high-volume information. AI is a data application at the end of the day."" - Ryan Gerbrandt

Digitizing the utility sector cannot happen safely without simultaneously also putting an intense emphasis on cybersecurity, Gerbrandt said. Referencing the recent FBI testimony about bad actors' successful initial penetration of critical U.S. infrastructure, Gerbrandt emphasized the importance of focusing on cybersecurity for new systems integrated into the grid, as well as the power of broadband technologies to be a key cybersecurity boost to the wider grid when implemented correctly.

""One of the key aspects of a private network is the level of control it provides,"" according to Gerbrandt. ""Utilities are not just getting the physical air-gapping capability; they're layering on best-practice cybersecurity solutions on top of it. So, we have some Ecosystem members at Distributech showing their zero-trust architectures and hardware encryption methods. Additionally, there are fascinating analytic systems that monitor traffic and analyze payloads. By constructing this new network from the ground up, it's so much easier to build security in, as opposed to bolting it on.""

Instead of looking at communication networks as another area that risks cyber-attacks, Gerbrandt notes:

""A utility that embraces its own broadband network can flip the script and make that network an asset in its system-wide cybersecurity strategy."" - Ryan Gerbrandt

Returning to the need for collaboration and joint learning, Gerbrandt discussed how proud he was that Anterix played a key role in co-founding the Utility Broadband Alliance. At a time just a few years ago when organizations like Anterix felt the industry wasn't as properly up to speed on what broadband can and should do to achieve utility goals including reliability, resilience, affordability, and flexibility, this Alliance's formation represented key stakeholders' recognition that progress would remain slower than it needed to be unless they took collective action.

""We recognized the necessity of fostering a broader understanding of broadband's significance within the industry,"" explained Gerbrandt. ""Our aim was to address why it's so vital and to initiate a platform for utility professionals to exchange insights and lessons learned.""

That perspective of uniting towards the common needs and ultimate goals was prescient, with the prominence that the broadband topic reached at Distributech 2024 serving as evidence. Utilities and vendors alike have reaped the benefits of collaboration among various stakeholders in developing modern solutions for complex challenges. And, as Gerbrandt noted, the shift away from single-vendor approaches toward collaborative models involving partnerships and ecosystems was the driving factor behind that rapid expansion.

Collaboration is also the name of the game when Anterix begins any engagement with a utility, serving not just as a provider of tools that utilities install and forget about, but instead filling the role of key long-term partner with utilities. Starting from the beginning of a utility's broadband journey, Gerbrandt and his team find most success comes from starting at the very beginning as educators all the way through implementation, monitoring, upgrades, and the entire journey. Technology companies are becoming comprehensive support providers, and Gerbrandt and his team emphasize that the most progress comes from building enduring relationships and supporting utilities end-to-end in their transformational journeys.

Looking toward the horizon, the future of the power industry beckons with promise and innovation. Anticipated trends in big data, AI, and analytics signal a resurgence in leveraging data-intensive applications to drive efficiency, cost savings, and reliability enhancements. As industry professionals chart a course forward, they do so with a keen eye on the transformative potential of collaborative solutions and the collective pursuit of a resilient and secure energy landscape.

""We're seeing the resurgence of leveraging data-intensive applications and integration of advanced technologies to drive efficiency, cost improvements, and reliability enhancements,"" said Gerbrandt, and once again noting the need for collaboration and how it really is the ""relationships and the community that drive progress,"" he continued. ""I'm incredibly proud of our efforts through the Anterix Active Ecosystem and our partnerships with utilities, as they facilitate the convergence of ideas. I firmly believe that the most impactful innovations will emerge from this collaborative model.""",energycentral.com,news,Energy Central,,0.4274509803921569,448644115,1,https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2024/3/distributech2024_tp_900x600_ryan20gerbrandt201.jpg?itok=lFlcXmtp,

Here's perhaps the best way to think about Sunday's Thermal Club $1 Million Challenge IndyCar exhibition race in the California desert near Palm Springs:

It will be like a PGA Tour tournament played on a pristine golf course surrounded by palatial houses you can't afford with ticket prices that scorch the wallet.

The exhibition race, the first in IndyCar since a 2008 visit to Surfers Paradise in Australia, is precisely that -- an exhibition. It will be 20 laps on a 3.067-mile road course. Only 12 drivers will participate in the feature, which is expected to be over by the time you gather your beverages and chips and settle into the recliner.

The ""big"" thing about this non-points race is the $1.7 million purse, one of the biggest in IndyCar history, with about $500,000 going to the winner. The size of that prize has created more than a little talk about how the race will progress, as drivers decide whether to risk expensive machinery in a late-race battle for positions when no series points are available.

First place will pay a lot, but is it enough to put a tire where it might not fit?

The race is a true outlier for IndyCar. The Thermal Club is a very high-end private community with an initial membership expenditure in the $5 million range (including the purchase of a residential lot and house). Spectator tickets to the race are limited and costly (about $500 each) and generally are targeted at club members and their guests.

The club is designed for car enthusiasts and amateur racers. The property has a variety of race courses, garages and storage facilities that house dozens of expensive performance vehicles.

The 3-mile course that will be used Sunday is rated FIA Grade 2 and has had modifications for IndyCar, including additions of tire packs and extra runoff spaces. IndyCar president Jay Frye said the road course does not need SAFER barriers.

""The track will be in great shape,"" Frye said. ""They've done everything we've asked them to do, and safety is obviously paramount in everything that we do.""

Drivers are expected to reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour on the course's longest straight.

Former driver and broadcaster Townsend Bell described the course as ""the kind of facility that I think Carl Fisher (Indianapolis Motor Speedway builder) would build if he was alive today. It's a clean slate. It's a big vision.""

The race is a bridge of sorts between the March 10 IndyCar opener at St. Petersburg, Florida (won by Josef Newgarden) and the next points race, scheduled April 21 at Long Beach, California. In addition to giving drivers and teams track time during a long inactive stretch, the event also fills a time slot Sunday for NBC, which will broadcast the race against a packed schedule of NCAA tournament games.

""There's a lot going on in American sports this weekend and this time of year,"" said Penske Entertainment president Mark Miles. ""So you kind of work for what you think gives you your best opportunity both from the point of view of the teams and the fans who will be there and the television audience.

""We never thought of it as 'let's see how many people we can sell tickets to to be there for this. It's normally a private facility. It was meant to be a kind of high-end hospitality offering. So it's a little pricey.' ""

The course will be open for testing Friday and Saturday before Saturday night qualifying. Two 10-lap heats are scheduled Sunday morning. The top six finishers from each heat will race in the 20-lap feature (12:30 p.m. ET). The main event will be divided into two 10-lap runs with a 10-minute ""halftime"" break.",autoweek.com,news,Autoweek,,0.2392156862745098,448643708,1,"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scott-dixon-photo-credit-james-black-ref-image-without-watermark-m73119-65faee2b0801c.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.246xh&resize=640:*",

One way to do that is by embracing automation and continuous integration through DevOps practices. From streamlining workflows to improving collaboration between teams, there are countless reasons why IT pros should learn DevOps. Let's explore how this transformative approach can revolutionize your career and make you a sought-after expert in the field.

Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a buzzword that has been gaining popularity in the IT world over the past few years. Short for Development and Operations, DevOps is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, communication, automation, and integration between software developers and IT operations teams. In traditional software development, there is often a disconnect between these two departments which can lead to delays, inefficiencies and ultimately hinder the success of a project. DevOps aims to bridge this gap by breaking down silos and creating a culture of shared responsibility.

The main goal of DevOps is to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace while maintaining stability and reliability. This is achieved through automating processes such as code testing, building, deployment, and monitoring. By automating these repetitive tasks, developers can focus on writing code instead of spending time on manual processes. This not only speeds up the development process but also reduces human error and improves overall quality.

Another key aspect of DevOps is continuous integration (CI) - the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository where they are automatically built and tested. CI helps catch bugs early in the development cycle when they are easier and less expensive to fix. It also promotes collaboration among team members as each change made by a developer is immediately reflected in the shared codebase.

Embracing DevOps also involves implementing continuous delivery (CD) - an extension of CI where all changes that pass automated tests are automatically deployed into production-like environments. CD enables organizations to release small incremental changes quickly and reliably rather than large infrequent updates which are more prone to failures.

Why Automation and Continuous Integration are Important in IT?

Automation and continuous integration are two vital aspects of DevOps that play a critical role in the success of any IT team or project. These practices help streamline processes, increase efficiency, and reduce human error, ultimately leading to improved overall software quality.

One of the main reasons why automation is important in IT is its ability to speed up tasks and processes. With automation tools, routine tasks such as code compilation, testing, and deployment can be automated, saving developers precious time that can be redirected towards more complex or creative tasks. This not only improves productivity but also reduces the risk of burnout among team members who are often bogged down by tedious manual work.

Moreover, automation eliminates the possibility of human errors that may occur during repetitive tasks. Human errors are one of the leading causes of software bugs and system failures. By automating these processes, teams can ensure consistency and accuracy in their work while freeing up valuable resources for other strategic initiatives.

Another advantage of automation is its cost-effectiveness. By reducing manual labor requirements and improving efficiency, businesses can save on operational costs associated with managing their IT infrastructure. Additionally, automation helps organizations keep up with the increasing demands for faster delivery turnaround times without having to invest in additional resources.

Continuous integration (CI) complements automation by providing a set of practices aimed at integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently throughout the day. It enables developers to detect issues early on in the development process and make necessary adjustments before they escalate into bigger problems later on.

Frequent integration also promotes collaboration among team members by encouraging them to share code changes regularly and provide timely feedback to one another. This leads to better communication within teams resulting in enhanced coordination between different departments, such as development and operations.

Advantages of Learning DevOps for IT Professionals

There are numerous advantages for IT professionals who choose to learn DevOps, a combination of software development and IT operations. While DevOps may seem daunting at first, especially for those with limited coding experience, the benefits it offers make it an essential skill for any modern IT professional.

One major advantage of learning DevOps is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. As technology advancements continue to drive businesses forward, there is often more pressure on IT teams to deliver results quickly. With DevOps methodologies, manual processes can be automated using various tools and frameworks, reducing the time and effort needed for routine tasks. This frees up valuable time for IT professionals to focus on more complex and critical aspects of their job.

Another benefit of learning DevOps is improved collaboration between departments. Traditionally, developers work independently from operations teams. However, with DevOps practices in place, there is a closer alignment between these two functions. Through effective communication and collaboration facilitated by this approach, software development becomes more efficient and streamlined as potential issues are identified earlier in the process.

DevOps also promotes continuous integration (CI), which involves merging code changes into a shared repository frequently and automatically running tests to detect issues early on in the development process. This allows teams to catch bugs sooner rather than later when they become more costly and time-consuming to fix.

In addition to CI being advantageous for identifying bugs promptly, it also leads to increased overall quality of software products. By integrating code changes regularly, developers ensure that all pieces fit together seamlessly without causing conflicts or disruptions later on in development or deployment phases.

Learning DevOps also helps streamline software deployment processes through continuous delivery (CD). CD ensures that every change made during development can be deployed automatically if needed without extra manual intervention. By automating this crucial step in the process, not only does it save time but also decreases the risk associated with deploying new features or updates.

Moreover, adopting DevOps practices helps organizations become more agile in their approach to software development, enabling them to deliver products at a much faster pace. This results in quicker time-to-market and gives businesses a competitive edge over those still using traditional methods.

Real-Life Examples of Successful Implementation of DevOps

DevOps has been making waves in the tech industry in recent years, with numerous success stories of its successful implementation. Many organizations have adopted DevOps practices and experienced tangible improvements in their development processes and business outcomes.

One such example is Spotify, the popular music streaming service. With over 345 million monthly active users, delivering high-quality software updates at a rapid pace is crucial for Spotify's success. To achieve this, they implemented DevOps practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This helped them automate their deployment process, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency. As a result, Spotify saw a 24% increase in Scandinavia subscription revenues within six months of implementing DevOps.

Another well-known example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing platform by Amazon. AWS has been a pioneer in adopting DevOps practices to scale their product offerings rapidly. By using automated testing and deployment tools, AWS was able to release frequent updates without any downtime or disruptions for their customers. This not only improved customer satisfaction but also reduced operational costs for AWS.

Netflix is another exemplary case of DevOps success. The world's leading streaming service has embraced DevOps culture since its early days, constantly innovating and improving its services to maintain its spot at the top. Netflix's ability to deliver new features quickly while maintaining stability can be attributed to its heavily automated CI/CD pipeline that ensures faster feedback cycles and shorter release cycles.

Apart from these big players, many small businesses have also seen tremendous benefits from implementing DevOps practices. Take Datadog, a cloud monitoring and analytics platform that helps companies monitor their infrastructure performance. After transitioning into a more agile approach with enhanced automation capabilities through the use of microservices architecture supported by containers along with efficient APIs for interacting with applications rather than servers directly made system maintenance easier & quicker than ever before.

Marlink's technical team organised the installation of the antennas, below decks equipment and integration to the ship's network during an extensive refit which saw the ice-capable vessel prepared for sailing to remote and polar regions.

""Exploris has a mission dedicated to bringing new and exciting locations to life for our guests and enabling them to share their experiences with friends and family in real time,"" said Philippe Videau, President, Exploris. ""Marlink shares our vision of providing excellence to our guests and keeping the vessel safe and connected wherever it is sailing.""

""Only Marlink has the expertise to orchestrate complex networks enabling digital services and possibilities onboard and provide them in a solution that supports vessel operations and enables guests to share their experiences,"" said Tore Morten Olsen, President Maritime, Marlink.

Commissioner representing Ondo state on the NDDC board, Otito Atikase, in a statement on Wednesday stated that the NDDC has been hard at work in the past few months to restore electricity to the southern region of Ondo State that has perpetually remained in pitch darkness for over fifteen years now.

Atikase, in a statement by his media aide, Rotimi Oyeneyin, explained that ""One significant milestone achieved is the completion and energization of the 132KV Transmission Line from Omotosho, coupled with the establishment of the 132KV/33KV Substation at Erinje, Okitipupa Local Government.

""These vital components of the project, undertaken and wholly funded by the Federal Government through the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) now stand as spotlights of progress, bringing steady electricity to the substation and its surrounding areas.

""However, the journey towards full electrification does not end here. Recognizing the interconnectedness of the distribution network, the NDDC has embarked on a rehabilitation of the inter-distribution network of the communities within reach.

""The awarding of the Erinje project, extending from Okitipupa to Igbokoda and down to Ugbonla, underscores the commitment to ensuring seamless electricity distribution to every neighbourhood.

""With this phase set to conclude in a matter of weeks, the vision of comprehensive electrification edges closer to fruition. Other things being equal, the project is expected to be inaugurated by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in April,2024.""

According to the commissioner, NDDC has taken proactive steps by formally notifying the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) of the handover of the substation.

""The tentative date for this significant event has been earmarked for the 26th of March, 2024, marking a historic moment in the project's timeline.

""It is noteworthy that the Ondo State government has no role to play thus far in the project implementation, as the present focus remains on addressing the high-tension aspects of the electrification process.

""However, as the project progresses towards low-tension implementation, the state government's role in providing meters and other ancillary needs to households will become increasingly vital.

It will be like a PGA Tour tournament played on a pristine golf course surrounded by palatial houses you can't afford with ticket prices that scorch the wallet.

The exhibition race, the first in IndyCar since a 2008 visit to Surfers Paradise in Australia, is precisely that -- an exhibition. It will be 20 laps on a 3.067-mile road course. Only 12 drivers will participate in the feature, which is expected to be over by the time you gather your beverages and chips and settle into the recliner.

The ""big"" thing about this non-points race is the $1.7 million purse, one of the biggest in IndyCar history, with about $500,000 going to the winner. The size of that prize has created more than a little talk about how the race will progress, as drivers decide whether to risk expensive machinery in a late-race battle for positions when no series points are available.

First place will pay a lot, but is it enough to put a tire where it might not fit?

The race is a true outlier for IndyCar. The Thermal Club is a very high-end private community with an initial membership expenditure in the $5 million range (including the purchase of a residential lot and house). Spectator tickets to the race are limited and costly (about $500 each) and generally are targeted at club members and their guests.

The club is designed for car enthusiasts and amateur racers. The property has a variety of race courses, garages and storage facilities that house dozens of expensive performance vehicles.

The 3-mile course that will be used Sunday is rated FIA Grade 2 and has had modifications for IndyCar, including additions of tire packs and extra runoff spaces. IndyCar president Jay Frye said the road course does not need SAFER barriers.

""The track will be in great shape,"" Frye said. ""They've done everything we've asked them to do, and safety is obviously paramount in everything that we do.""

Drivers are expected to reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour on the course's longest straight.

Former driver and broadcaster Townsend Bell described the course as ""the kind of facility that I think Carl Fisher (Indianapolis Motor Speedway builder) would build if he was alive today. It's a clean slate. It's a big vision.""

The race is a bridge of sorts between the March 10 IndyCar opener at St. Petersburg, Florida (won by Josef Newgarden) and the next points race, scheduled April 21 at Long Beach, California. In addition to giving drivers and teams track time during a long inactive stretch, the event also fills a time slot Sunday for NBC, which will broadcast the race against a packed schedule of NCAA tournament games.

""There's a lot going on in American sports this weekend and this time of year,"" said Penske Entertainment president Mark Miles. ""So you kind of work for what you think gives you your best opportunity both from the point of view of the teams and the fans who will be there and the television audience.

""We never thought of it as 'let's see how many people we can sell tickets to to be there for this. It's normally a private facility. It was meant to be a kind of high-end hospitality offering. So it's a little pricey.' ""

The course will be open for testing Friday and Saturday before Saturday night qualifying. Two 10-lap heats are scheduled Sunday morning. The top six finishers from each heat will race in the 20-lap feature (12:30 p.m. ET). The main event will be divided into two 10-lap runs with a 10-minute ""halftime"" break.",sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports,,0.3960784313725489,448641360,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/autos.autoweek.com/f49272d42417418ca06ff71a27798364,eng-9411275

TEL AVIV, Israel, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IONIX today announced a force multiplier to its industry-leading Attack Surface Management (ASM) platform, a centralized Threat Center to accelerate security teams' response to newly disclosed zero-days. IONIX Threat Center delivers up-to-the-minute detailed insights into exposures posed by the latest zero-day vulnerabilities. The new Threat Center identifies specific assets that are exposed or potentially exposed to the zero-day exploit, alerts customers and highlights suggested remediation actions. With this information, IONIX customers are able to respond up to three times faster to zero-day threats.

IONIX Threat Center works alongside the company's recently announced integration of Exposure Validation capabilities. In response to new zero-days that are exploited in the wild, the IONIX Threat Lab research team performs non-intrusive exploit simulations on each customer's unique environment to identify and validate exploitable (and potentially exploitable) assets. The validated findings are presented in the IONIX Threat Center so customers have focused visibility into their zero-day exposures and one-click access to the necessary remediation action items.

For example, in January, maintainers of the open-source software Jenkins resolved security flaws including a critical bug that could have resulted in remote code execution if exploited. The identifier CVE-2024-23897 was assigned to this critical risk. Within hours, the IONIX platform mapped and tested the exploitability of all its customers' Jenkins instances, and alerted customers to this detailed information in the Threat Center.

""It's commonly assumed that only two percent of zero-day vulnerabilities are actively exploited. Getting to that two percent and helping customers identify the assets with exploitable risks - that's where the focus of cybersecurity teams should be,"" said Marc Gaffan, CEO of IONIX. ""With the new Threat Center, IONIX brings clarity to the real impact of zero-day exploits - helping our customers easily identify and fix their important and exploitable assets, urgently.""

IONIX Threat Center

Backed by the IONIX research team's continuous scanning and vulnerability tracking, the Threat Center ensures that new vulnerabilities are quickly identified and analyzed, and that customers' specific exploitable assets are highlighted. Key functions of the IONIX Threat Center include:

ABB has won the contract to provide a complete shore connection installation for the DEME Base in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. Shore connection enables the diverse fleet of dredgers, offshore construction and support vessels to avoid carbon emissions by shutting off their engines and drawing on shore power while at berth. Headquartered in Belgium, DEME is a leading contractor in the fields of offshore energy, environmental remediation, dredging and marine infrastructure.

DEME has set itself a goal of cutting 40 percent from the greenhouse gases generated by its fleet by 2030 compared to 2008, moving significantly ahead of the revised emissions reduction target set by the International Maritime Organization in 2023. ABB will install shore power to connect to suitably equipped vessels calling at Vlissingen's DEME base by the end of 2024, as part of the ""Temporary Shore Power Grant Scheme for Marine Vessels 2022 - 2023"", a government-supported initiative that stimulates the construction and use of shore power facilities in Dutch seaports.

Offering a key route for ship owners to make measurable progress towards decarbonization, connecting to shore power for energy needs while at berth is expected to become mandatory at main EU ports listed in the trans-European transport network from 2030, under FuelEU Maritime regulations.

""This project is part of DEME's wider strategy to integrate its sustainable business goals with daily operations,"" Marc De Boom, Department Manager, DEME Base Vlissingen. ""DEME has high ambitions regarding CO? reductions, and we are proud to be the first Belgian marine contractor who achieved the highest level of the CO? performance ladder, which is widely used in the Netherlands and Belgium. We are happy to collaborate with ABB, an experienced and reliable technology leader with a solid track record in shore connection installations.""

Awarded after a private tender process, the DEME contract provides a strong example of the way ABB aligns with local interests to ensure that its solutions are flexible in helping meet decarbonization milestones. Ultimately planned as a 2MvA converter, ABB's shoreside shore connection will run at a lower 1.75MvA until the local grid can deliver sufficient capacity between the substation and the power outlet at the dock. In a straightforward installation, the entire solution will be housed in two ISO containers - one 40-ft unit and one 20-ft unit.

""We are delighted to have secured this significant shore connection contract and look forward to working with DEME to support its ambitious commitments for maritime decarbonization,"" said Frank van Delden, Account Manager, ABB Marine & Ports. ""Given the diversity of the DEME fleet, this is a key reference for our shore power technology, showing that almost any type of vessel can avoid emissions by connecting to shore power at the quay.""

Established as the market leading supplier of shipside shore connection solutions, ABB delivered the world's first shore power supply system to the Swedish port of Gothenburg in 2000 and the first shipside installation in 2001. Today, ABB shore connections can be installed on a standardized, pre-assembled basis for integration with all shipboard electricity consumers.",gcaptain.com,news,gCaptain,,0.3803921568627451,448641052,1,https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bef989c8-d4ed-dbde-4718-bbed310febd2-scaled.jpg,

Foreign Secretary David Cameron has confirmed the UK has dispatched more than 2,000 tonnes of food aid for 275,000 people as part of its largest delivery of aid to Gaza.

Announcement of the UK's delivery comes as the United Nations has warned a famine could hit the northern part of the enclave anytime between now and May 2024.

""It's crucial that we keep the flow of aid moving into Gaza to end the suffering, and that's why this latest delivery of aid by WFP [World Food Programme] is so vitally important,"" Cameron said.

What does the latest UK package include?

The UK has funded the delivery of more than 2,000 tonnes of food facilitated by Jordan.

The delivery contains fortified wheat flour for use in bakeries, hot meals and ready-to-eat food parcels to feed more than 275,000 people.

Each parcel can provide half of the daily calorie intake a family of five for 15 days. The UK had already sent 150 tonnes of relief items like blankets and tents. It has also delivered as a full field hospital run by UK-Med.

The WFP is in charge of distributing the new UK aid on the ground.

How is the WFP distributing aid?

The WFP holds distribution points in local shops where they hand out parcels with canned pulses, canned meat and high-calorie foods, including date bars.

It also helps local bakeries get back on their feet by giving them wheat flour and other resources.

The WFP has said nine bakeries in the central city of Deir el-Balah and the southern city of Rafah have restarted the production of bread after being forced to stop operations for 50 days. As a result, around 500,000 people have been able to buy bread again.

The WFP works with the UN-led Logistics Cluster, Emergency Telecommunications Cluster and Food Security Cluster as well as local partners on the ground to deliver assistance to those in need.

Aid has become vital as the entire population of Gaza - about 2.3 million people - are facing high levels of ""acute"" of food insecurity, among which 1.1 million - half of Gaza - suffer from catastrophic food insecurity.

UN secretary-general António Guterres sounded the alarm after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification - a global scale for classifying the severity and magnitude of global hunger - put out its report on Monday.

Reinvited as an SUV from the original MPV with the debut of the second generation eight years ago, Peugeot has showcased the all-new E-5008 that makes the added transition from combustion engine motivation to a dedicated hybrid or full EV.

Although similar in profile to its predecessor that received its one and only mid-life update four years ago, the 5008 - still pronounced five-thousand-and-eight and not five-double-oh-eight -largely serves as a step-up from the all-electric E-3008 unveiled last year.

ALSO READ: Following the pride: Flagship Peugeot 5008 ups the aggressive ante

The latest model to make use of parent company Stellantis' largely electric dedicated STLA Medium platform, the E-5008 measures 4.7 m long, 1.6 m tall and 1.8 m wide with its wheelbase being a surprise dimensional unknown.

Confirmed though, the boot offers-up 259-litres in seven-seat guise, which extends to 748-litres with the third row folded down. With the second row also lowered though, total utility space adds-up to 1 815-litres.

Resplendent with styling similar to the E-3008, the E-5008 offers a choice of two trim levels with the flagship GT being distinguished from the range-topping by the fitting of the Pixel LED headlights, sportier bumpers and door sills, 20-inch as opposed to 19-inch alloy wheels, black finishes on the studded sealed grille, as well as a panoramic sunroof.

Its aesthetic also borrowing from the coupe-styled 408, the E-5008's colour palette spans six hues; Okenite White, Artense Grey, Pearl Black, Titanium Grey, Ingaro Blue and Obsession Blue, with a contrasting black roof standard on the GT.

Inside, the layout of the i-Cockpit dashboard carries over from the E-3008 without much change, meaning the retention of the single-piece 21-inch infotainment display and instrument cluster atop the dash itself, the floating L-shaped centre console, compact steering wheel and a series of touch-sensitive buttons as well as toggle switches.

While notable spec on both the Allure and GT involves the mentioned display with integrated ChatGPT, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the latter also gets an electric tailgate, front parking sensors to go with the former's rears, a heated steering wheel, imitation leather instead of faux fabric seats, and a full 360-degree camera system as opposed to the 180-degree Visiopark display.

Also standard on the GT is a wireless smartphone charger, heated and ventilated front seats with a massaging function, ambient lighting and an expanded array of safety systems made-up of Adaptive Cruise Control, semi-autonomous Lane Change Assist, Driver Attention Alert and Blind Spot Monitoring.

Although focused on electrification in readiness for Peugeot becoming a wholly electric brand by next year, up front, the 400-volt STLA Medium support the option of a combustion engine powerplant, which does, however, come with EV assistance in the form of a 48-volt mild-hybrid system.

Paired to the long-serving 1.2-litre three-cylinder PureTech petrol engine, the mild-hybrid E-5008 develops 100 kW directed to the front wheels only through a six-speed dual-clutch transmission.

A second a partial combustion option is the plug-in hybrid 195 that pairs the bigger 1.6-litre turbo PureTech petrol with a 92 kW electric motor and accompanying electric motor.

As its name points out, the total system output comes to 195 pferdestarke(PS) or 143 kW that goes to the front wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. The claimed all-electric range is 80 km.

Taking pride of place though are the fully electric models motivated by a choice of two battery pack delivering 73-kWh and 98-kWh.

Identical to what the E-3008 uses, the entry-level Electric 210 starts the range off with outputs of 210 PS or 157kW/343Nm. The claimed range is 500 km with driving going to the front axle only.

Stepping up to the Electric 230 brings not only the bigger battery pack, but also outputs of 170kW/343Nm plus a claimed range of 660 km.

Sitting atop the E-5008 range as it does in the E-3008 is the dual-motor Electric 320 that adds a secondary electric motor to the rear axle for an all-wheel-drive layout.

Still propelled by the 98-kWh battery pack, the final output comes to 320 PS or 235 kW, with torque staying put at 345 Nm.

Given its added weight in spite of having more power than the Electric 230, range in the Electric 320 falls to a 500 km.

On the charging front, the E-5008 supports both AC and DC charging with the former consisting of a standard 11 kW charger, or an optional 22 kW item.

DC charger can be done up to 160 kW where a waiting time of 10 minutes results in a range of 100 km. Charged from 20% to 80% requires a further 20 minutes of patience.

Set to go on-sale in Europe from September, Stellantis South Africa has, for the time being, not confirmed the E-5008 in any form for the local market.",citizen.co.za,news,The Citizen,Charl Bosch,0.2392156862745098,448640320,1,https://www.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PE2.jpg,

The analysis of nearly 1,400 retail industry decision-makers revealed that real-world implementation and deployment of artificial intelligence don't match the strong enthusiasm and demand for the technology.

Nearly half of those studied are battling with data accessibility issues, and only two in five (42%) have successfully bridged gaps between data silos, which Salesforce stresses threatens the effectiveness and accuracy of AI-driven insights.

Salesforce cites an external study to highlight the integral role that generative AI plays in the retail industry. By 2029, the technology is expected to have had a $9.2 trillion impact on the sector.

The study also notes customer sentiment surrounding generative AI, with only 13% being confident that companies will use it ethically. Another two-thirds (63%) are concerned that AI will produce biased results.

Salesforce GM of Retail and Consumer Goods, Rob Garf, emphasized the importance of a holistic approach to AI implementation: ""The AI revolution is about data, trust, and customer experience. Looking at AI in isolation, without understanding these elements as a package, will hurt a retailer's ability to build loyalty and improve customer relationships.""

The industry sees GenAI playing a role in customer service, marketing, and store operations, with 93% of the current users benefitting from the technology's ability to personalize results, including creating emails and suggesting products.

Looking ahead, Salesforce reaffirms that companies have a long way to go to prepare their data for effective AI deployment. Only 17% of companies boast a complete view of customer data, while data cleaning (39%) and harmonization (42%) continue to be problematic for many.

Looking ahead, it's clear that bridging the gap between data strategy, ethical AI usage, and customer trust is imperative before the retail industry can really start to experience the multitrillion-dollar transformation.",techradar.com,news,TechRadar,,0.1294117647058823,448639540,1,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeucwt8s4Qt9z5KtumVLW9-1200-80.jpg,eng-9411910

It has been 16 years since IndyCar has held a non-points-paying round, and the series is hoping a unique format will be exciting for drivers and a fun viewing experience for fans watching from home.

Nothing is typical about the weekend schedule, so it is worth looking at what drivers can expect when they arrive at the track this Friday.

The Thermal Club is the setting for IndyCar's first exhibition race in over a decade. The facility is a private club in southern California that caters to wealthy racing enthusiasts that like to take exotic and powerful cars out on their own closed course.

Members have the ability to purchase plots of land trackside and construct houses just past the safety fencing, with nearly 100 having built residences on the property. No doubt these houses have ample garage space where they can store their prized motorized possessions between track runs.

The club's members will get a unique experience during the event weekend, as some individuals will be paired with the 27 professional drivers that are participating in the challenge. The members will be embedded within the team for the duration, and get an up close and personal view into what it takes to get an IndyCar on track.

The track itself is a long and winding course, with 17 turns spread around 3.067 miles of asphalt. There is very little in the way of elevation changes, but plenty of sweeping corners and gravel runoffs to keep the drivers on their toes.

During the preseason open test session held here ahead of the 2023 season, drivers were lapping the course just under the 1 minute 40 second barrier at an average speed of 112 MPH. Similar speeds are expected this weekend, with a slightly lighter car being balanced out by a slightly harder compound of Firestone tires.

There is nothing in the way of permanent grandstands or midway displays, and not even a large enough pit road to handle hot pit stops. The facility was designed for club member use only, so only a couple thousand fans were allowed to purchase pricey tickets to attend the special event. Full television coverage by NBC will give fans a familiar way to watch from home, however.

Kicking off the weekend is two days of open testing. Four separate sessions are being held throughout the opening days, and are a replacement for the typical preseason open test that was not held ahead of the 2024 season. The sessions also serve as practice time for drivers ahead of the more important running later on.

Late in the afternoon on Saturday, the series' 27 drivers will be split into two groups and will set fast times to qualify for Sunday's running. The standard knockout format will not be in use, and the single 12-minute run each driver gets will set the order.

Sunday is when the action gets going in earnest. Drivers from the first qualifying group will participate in a 10-lap heat race against their half of the field. The top six drivers will advance to the finals, while the rest will be done for the weekend. A second heat race will be run directly after to set the other half of the final.

The final $1 million challenge will take place shortly after, with all 12 advancing drivers competing against one another for a pot of cash. The final will consist of two 10-lap segments, with only fuel and wing angles allowed to be adjusted in between.

Drivers will have 40 seconds of Push to Pass for each segment, and laps under caution will not count towards the total. Once the 20 laps are complete, the checkered flags will wave, and the winner will claim his bonus.

The format is unique and should provide some interesting scenarios, as long as drivers are fighting over something desirable. Championship points may not on the line, but a substantial amount of money is.

The overall winner of the weekend will earn a healthy $500,000 prize in addition to bragging rights for the event. Of course not all of that will go directly into the winner's pockets - the team is technically the one that earns the prize money after all, not to mention taxes, but the lure of that many zeroes should help give everyone ample motivation to fight hard on track.

Originally, a Thermal Club member that would have been paired with the winning driver was also going to receive $500,000, but that format was shelved after a more ambitious weekend plan fell through. Instead of members putting forward a buy-in fee and competing in their own race that contributed to the overall standings, they will simply be embedded within the teams in the paddock and stay involved in the action that way.

Prizes for the other top finishers are nothing to sneeze at either, with second place earning $350,000 and third place walking away with $250,000. Any place on the podium will be a desirable outcome considering the significant sums on offer for all three places.

The fourth and fifth place finishers will earn $100,000 and $50,000 respectively, with each of the other participants taking home $23,000 each. The total prize purse for the weekend is over $1.7 million, allowing IndyCar to market the event with the enticing $1 Million Challenge moniker.

Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the experience, but with Texas Motor Speedway off the schedule, the series had a gap to fill and was willing to try out a new format. With the entire weekend set up to cater to a television audience with lots of fun moments scattered between some intense racing, it is easy to see why most in the paddock are eager to give it a try.

Continuing the Biden administration's push toward reducing industrial emissions and advancing clean energy manufacturing, the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Manufacturing Energy Supply Chains (MESC) issued a second funding opportunity announcement (FOA) for the Advanced Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program.

The Advanced Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program is designed to provide grants to small- and medium-sized manufacturers to enable them to build new or retrofit existing manufacturing and industrial facilities. These facilities must produce or recycle advanced energy products or contribute to emissions reductions within the manufacturing sector. Projects must also be located in communities where coal mines or coal power plants have closed.

The first round of funding provided $275 million in grants, and this latest round will provide approximately $425 million. DOE's share of an individual award may vary between $2 million and $100 million. DOE will fund up to 50% of allowable costs for awarded projects. The awarded entity will be responsible for the remaining costs for awarded projects, known as ""cost share.""

DOE anticipates making awards that will run up to 36 months in length, comprised of one or more budget periods. Awardees must complete their projects not later than three years after the date of receipt of federal funds.

Why It Matters

Unlike the first round of funding through the Advanced Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program, this new opportunity includes industrial decarbonization.

Awards made through this latest round can be used to:

Areas of Interest

This funding opportunity has two Areas of Interest (AOI):

AOI 1: Clean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling

Applications for Clean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling should aim to establish, re-equip, or expand an existing manufacturing or recycling facility for the production or recycling of advanced energy.

DOE anticipates making between 2 to 10 awards in this AOI, with 1-7 ""small awards"" ranging between $2 million and $10 million, and 1 to 3 ""large awards"" ranging between $10 million and $100 million.

AOI 2: Industrial Decarbonization

Industrial Decarbonization is a new area of interest for the second round of the program, and applications should focus on building or upgrading manufacturing facilities to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create low-carbon materials. Proposed technologies should be proven and ready for commercial-scale deployment (TRL 7-9). DOE cites iron, steel, steel mill products, aluminum, cement, concrete, glass, pulp, paper, industrial ceramics, chemicals, and other energy-intensive industrial processes that can have the highest impact toward reducing GHG emission reductions and therefore would be well-aligned for this topic.

MESC anticipates making between 3 to 15 awards in this AOI, with 2 to 12 ""small awards"" ranging between $2 million and $10 million, and 1 to 3 ""large awards"" ranging between $10 million and $100 million.

Expectations of Applicants

Interested parties must submit concept papers of no more than three pages by April 8, 2024.

Full applications are due no later than June 24, 2024.

MESC strongly encourages applicants to submit concept papers and full applications at least 48 hours in advance of the submission deadline.

All applicants are required to submit a plan demonstrating the project's quantifiable impact and benefits to the workers and the local community through DOE's commitment to engaging communities and labor; investing in America's workers through quality jobs; advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; and implementing the President's Justice40 Initiative, which set the goal of 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.

Eligibility Requirements

Eligible applicants include small- and medium-sized manufacturers that meet certain size, revenue, and other requirements with a proposed project within the restricted geographic locations identified by the funding opportunity announcement.

All projects funded under this program must be in communities where coal mines have closed since December 31, 1999, or where coal-fired power plants have closed since December 31, 2009. Eligible communities can be identified on a mapping tool created by the Department of Energy.

DOE will accept only new applications under this FOA. DOE will not consider applications for renewals of existing DOE-funded awards through this FOA.",mondaq.com,news,Mondaq Business Briefing,,0.4352941176470588,448638866,1,https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg,

TEL AVIV, Israel, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IONIX today announced a force multiplier to its industry-leading Attack Surface Management (ASM) platform, a centralized Threat Center to accelerate security teams' response to newly disclosed zero-days. IONIX Threat Center delivers up-to-the-minute detailed insights into exposures posed by the latest zero-day vulnerabilities. The new Threat Center identifies specific assets that are exposed or potentially exposed to the zero-day exploit, alerts customers and highlights suggested remediation actions. With this information, IONIX customers are able to respond up to three times faster to zero-day threats.

IONIX Threat Center works alongside the company's recently announced integration of Exposure Validation capabilities. In response to new zero-days that are exploited in the wild, the IONIX Threat Lab research team performs non-intrusive exploit simulations on each customer's unique environment to identify and validate exploitable (and potentially exploitable) assets. The validated findings are presented in the IONIX Threat Center so customers have focused visibility into their zero-day exposures and one-click access to the necessary remediation action items.

For example, in January, maintainers of the open-source software Jenkins resolved security flaws including a critical bug that could have resulted in remote code execution if exploited. The identifier CVE-2024-23897 was assigned to this critical risk. Within hours, the IONIX platform mapped and tested the exploitability of all its customers' Jenkins instances, and alerted customers to this detailed information in the Threat Center.

""It's commonly assumed that only two percent of zero-day vulnerabilities are actively exploited. Getting to that two percent and helping customers identify the assets with exploitable risks - that's where the focus of cybersecurity teams should be,"" said Marc Gaffan, CEO of IONIX. ""With the new Threat Center, IONIX brings clarity to the real impact of zero-day exploits - helping our customers easily identify and fix their important and exploitable assets, urgently.""

IONIX Threat Center

Backed by the IONIX research team's continuous scanning and vulnerability tracking, the Threat Center ensures that new vulnerabilities are quickly identified and analyzed, and that customers' specific exploitable assets are highlighted. Key functions of the IONIX Threat Center include:

The port is also Europe's largest energy hub. Randolf Weterings is Program Manager Electrification & Hydrogen New Business at the port. He knows, more than anyone, the challenges of decarbonizing the port and energy hub.

""The Port of Rotterdam is an important gateway for goods and energy coming in to northwest Europe,"" says Weterings. ""As an example, the port handles 13% of Europe's total energy needs. The port itself is quite extensive, too. In an area 42 km long, and between 2 and 5 km wide there are some 3,000 companies. You could say that decarbonizing the whole thing is quite a challenge.""

""We started our practical planning for decarbonization in 2016, based on four concerns: efficiency and infrastructure, a new energy system, a new resource and fuel system, and sustainable transportation. On infrastructure, we want to make sure all the facilities are in place for decarbonization: a bigger and more robust electricity grid and sufficient hydrogen, CO, heat, and steam networks.""

""The new energy system revolves around renewable energy sources, but also includes electrifying industry and expanding the hydrogen programme. We see hydrogen both as an energy source and as a building block for the raw materials transition. The great advantage of hydrogen from renewable sources, such as wind power, lies in the fact that the hydrogen is carbon-free and it's also a means of transporting and storing renewable energy.""

""The new resource and fuel system is about building bio-based industries and establishing a circular economy. And sustainable transportation means using clean fuel for ships and trucks going to and from Rotterdam.""

""Hydrogen is one of the building blocks crucial to decarbonization, so we're looking to massively scale up its use. We're talking about both low-carbon hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, because we can't limit ourselves - certainly not in the short term - to just one or the other. We aim to be able to produce 0.6 million tonnes of climate-neutral hydrogen locally every year by 2030 and import a further 4 million tonnes a year on top of that.""

""In terms of our local production by 2030, we're planning on half a million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen and a quarter of a million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. We'll get 0.2 million tonnes by capturing CO emissions from existing hydrogen plants and storing it safely in underground gas fields. The Porthos Carbon Transport & Storage project is going to make that happen. In October 2023, Porthos made the final decision to invest in it and the first raw materials for Porthos construction have already been delivered. We expect it to be up and running in two years.""

""The remaining 0.3 million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen are going to come from the H-Vision project: residual gases from industry, to be converted to hydrogen in the future.""

The quarter of a million tonnes of renewable hydrogen will be produced using electrolysers, located in a 'conversion park' in the Maasvlakte, where Air Liquide is planning to construct a 200 MW-capacity electrolyser.

""But, we've started building a second conversion park because we want to have between 2 and 2.5 gigawatt hydrogen capacity by 2030. We're making the second conversion park site available to whichever party or consortium wins the IJmuiden Ver wind farm tender. The renewable electricity from the wind farm can then be used to produce renewable hydrogen on a large scale.""

""It's impossible to produce renewable hydrogen using electrolysers without renewable electricity, which is why producers need this kind of power procurement contract. By the way, this approach is in line with the new European rules around renewable hydrogen. Not only that, it's an efficient way to integrate wind power optimally into the energy system. And by planning hydrogen production on the coast, we avoid extra load on the high-voltage grid. That's why the ministry encourages this approach.""

""We reckon on having around 20 to 25 gigawatts of green energy from offshore wind turbines available in Rotterdam by 2050 for the production of renewable hydrogen on-shore, or where the hydrogen is already produced on-site at the wind turbines themselves. That 20 to 25 gigawatts is also the maximum we can achieve initially, because we also need wind energy to replace coal-fired power plants, and we don't have any space left to install more wind turbines. Given all the other activities in the North Sea, at some point it will just be full.""

In north-western Europe, we cannot generate enough renewable energy to produce the hydrogen we need, and so we have to import much of it anyway. For the Port of Rotterdam, we estimate some 18 million tonnes per year by 2050. To achieve this, the port is currently in talks with more than 20 countries. Aside from the geopolitical situation, the price of renewable energy is the decisive factor. As a rule, the price in countries with better solar and wind conditions is lower than here.

There are a number of long-distance hydrogen transport carriers, each with their strengths and weaknesses. But, given the short time left to meet the 2030 targets, we will have to rely mainly on ammonia until then, since the technology for this is already widely available. In the Port of Rotterdam, meanwhile, nine terminals have already announced that they will import hydrogen, and six have committed to ammonia.

""For renewable hydrogen produced within the EU, there's now a certification system that means producers can prove that their hydrogen is 100% renewable. But for hydrogen imported from outside the EU, the certification schemes aren't yet fully in alignment. But, the Hydrogen Council - the Port of Rotterdam Authority and Air Liquide are members - has already got initial agreement on this at the last COP28 climate summit.""

In late 2023, Hynetwork Services (editor's note: a subsidiary of Gasunie, the Dutch gas infrastructure company) put the first spade in the ground to build the national hydrogen network. Starting in 2030, this network should connect the main industrial regions of the Netherlands with each other, Belgium, and Germany. The first section could be commissioned as early as 2025, connecting the Maasvlakte to Pernis.

""We also need a more robust and better equipped electricity grid. That's why Tennet, the grid operator, are building a new high-voltage substation, among other installations, on the Maasvlakte. This will assist the progress of all those large-scale offshore wind projects and the planned electrolysers.""

""Air Liquide is an important partner for us, partly because they're a pioneer and an accelerating force making the port more sustainable, especially around hydrogen. Air Liquide operates several production units and the company has a lot of infrastructure. We anticipate that Air Liquide will also play a major role in importing and handling hydrogen. With their knowledge and experience, Air Liquide can also help other parties in the port make the switch to hydrogen.""

""The time for just talk is thankfully over. There's now a real move from talking to doing. You notice that once the government takes important decisions, things gain momentum.""

Through this acquisition, Rheinmetall expands its range of vehicles to include innovative light hybrid vehicles.

At the start of March 2024, Rheinmetall's Dutch subsidiary, Rheinmetall Defence Nederland, part of the Vehicle Systems Division, acquired 100 per cent of the Dutch startup REEQ shares.

The acquisition will allow Rheinmetall to broaden its portfolio of lightweight tactical vehicles and move toward hybrid technology with a fully electric drivetrain in a military vehicle.

Both parties have agreed not to disclose the purchase price.

With this acquisition, Rheinmetall is responding to the calls from Dutch politicians and defence leaders to contribute to the defence industry.

REEQ will remain a startup within Rheinmetall Group for development, with production in the Netherlands.

REEQ was founded in 2018 and has a vehicle portfolio that includes an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), a side-by-side buggy, and a quad.

All three vehicles have the same fully electric drive train.

A delegation from PHP Wind, led by Roger Myette - the project's construction manager and co-chair of its community liaison committee - spent more than an hour updating elected reps on timelines and key milestones, and addressing common fears about the technology.

Referring to an issue raised by a member of the initiative's recently formed community liaison committee about oil leaking from wind turbines' gearboxes, he said, ""One thing I know you are all probably wondering is what's the worst thing [about this] for pollution and contamination. One point that was asked was [whether] they contaminate the ground by spilling millions of litres of oil.""

""That's not the case,"" he said, noting that the turbines PHP plans to use are manufactured by Chicago-based Nordex, which pioneered the mass production of turbines for sale around the world in 1995. In these units, ""The cell where all the oil is fully self-contained and includes the transformer, generator and gearbox.""

Other resonant fears among those living close to turbines, he said, concern the ""whoosh"" or ""swish"" of the blades and something called ""shadow flicker,"" which is the effect of the sun, low on the horizon, shining through the rotating assembly, casting a moving shadow.

""We've done all the studies,"" Myette said. ""The modeling assumes worst case scenario for every aspect, every input, and nothing is outside the allowables. It's a very light whisper when you're outside [your] house. Inside, you won't hear it. As for shadow flicker, [these turbines] won't be near houses, so there's no impact.""

The Goose Harbour Lake Wind Farm - which received environmental approval from the province last year - will be located on Municipality of the District of Guysborough (MODG) land near the communities of Upper Big Tracadie and Lincolnville that is under license to PHP for sustainable forest management.

The facility - which will need access to public roads owned by the Town of Mulgrave - will consist of up to 31 wind turbines and is expected to have an annual capacity equivalent to more than 40 per cent of PHP's required electrical power demand when it is operational sometime in 2025 or later.",thepeterboroughexaminer.com,news,thepeterboroughexaminer.com,Alec Bruce,-0.2941176470588235,448635346,1,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thepeterboroughexaminer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/c7910cd6-fbf6-11ed-943a-477f8589b241.png?resize=600%2C600,

A delegation from PHP Wind, led by Roger Myette - the project's construction manager and co-chair of its community liaison committee - spent more than an hour updating elected reps on timelines and key milestones, and addressing common fears about the technology.

Referring to an issue raised by a member of the initiative's recently formed community liaison committee about oil leaking from wind turbines' gearboxes, he said, ""One thing I know you are all probably wondering is what's the worst thing [about this] for pollution and contamination. One point that was asked was [whether] they contaminate the ground by spilling millions of litres of oil.""

""That's not the case,"" he said, noting that the turbines PHP plans to use are manufactured by Chicago-based Nordex, which pioneered the mass production of turbines for sale around the world in 1995. In these units, ""The cell where all the oil is fully self-contained and includes the transformer, generator and gearbox.""

Other resonant fears among those living close to turbines, he said, concern the ""whoosh"" or ""swish"" of the blades and something called ""shadow flicker,"" which is the effect of the sun, low on the horizon, shining through the rotating assembly, casting a moving shadow.

""We've done all the studies,"" Myette said. ""The modeling assumes worst case scenario for every aspect, every input, and nothing is outside the allowables. It's a very light whisper when you're outside [your] house. Inside, you won't hear it. As for shadow flicker, [these turbines] won't be near houses, so there's no impact.""

The Goose Harbour Lake Wind Farm - which received environmental approval from the province last year - will be located on Municipality of the District of Guysborough (MODG) land near the communities of Upper Big Tracadie and Lincolnville that is under license to PHP for sustainable forest management.

The facility - which will need access to public roads owned by the Town of Mulgrave - will consist of up to 31 wind turbines and is expected to have an annual capacity equivalent to more than 40 per cent of PHP's required electrical power demand when it is operational sometime in 2025 or later.

This appeal comes in the wake of disappointing academic results, with no students achieving a grade 'A' in the past decade.

According to Kenya News Agency, during a bursary cheque distribution event at St Joseph's Chakol Secondary School, she highlighted the success of the hybrid learning system implemented in top-performing schools such as Butere Girls. Emase encouraged local educators to consider benchmarking against these schools to understand and adopt effective online learning strategies.

Furthermore, Emase emphasized that the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) for Teso South is prepared to invest in necessary software and support benchmarking activities to revive the academic prestige once held by local schools like St. Monica Chakol Girls and St. Pauls Amukura. She expressed concerns over the return on investment in education, criticizing the situation where students supported by bursaries over four years end up with low grades such as 'E'.

The MP advised students who perform poorly in academic settings to consider enrolling in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges instead, where they can acquire practical skills beneficial for their future. During her address, she also highlighted the disbursement of Sh64 million in bursary funds by the NG-CDF to alleviate the financial strain on schools and families, urging parents to meet their obligations and reduce fee arrears.

Emase called for parental responsibility in supporting educational institutions and criticized those who neglect their financial duties, leading to significant debts and student suspensions. She also cautioned political leaders against bringing politics into educational matters, referencing recent incidents where parents withdrew their children from Asinge Secondary School due to alleged poor management and political interference, following a year where the highest school grade was a 'D' plain and 70% of students scored 'E'.

The MP's statements underscore the urgent need for educational reform and parental involvement in Teso South to improve student performance and academic standards.",africanewswire.za.com,news,Africa News Wire,,0.1372549019607843,448633228,1,,

As Kenyan traders navigate the complexities of the global currency market, VR technologies promise to offer unprecedented insights and interactive capabilities, enhancing decision-making processes and trading strategies.

Kenya's Forex trading landscape is characterized by its dynamic nature, with traders continuously seeking innovative tools and technologies to gain a competitive edge. The integration of VR into online Forex trading platforms represents a significant leap forward, offering a blend of real-time market analysis, enhanced educational opportunities, and immersive trading simulations.

The integration of VR technologies in Forex trading platforms presents both challenges and opportunities for the Kenyan market. While the initial cost and accessibility of VR equipment may pose hurdles, the potential for enhanced trading experiences and improved educational outcomes is significant. Moreover, as internet connectivity improves across Kenya, the adoption of VR in Forex trading is set to increase, offering traders a more interactive and engaging platform to hone their skills.

As the Forex trading landscape in Kenya embraces Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, understanding its practical implications becomes crucial for traders aiming to leverage these advancements. VR stands to revolutionize the trading experience by offering deeper market insights, fostering skill development, and enhancing trader engagement. However, the journey towards widespread adoption comes with its set of hurdles and considerations.

The adoption of VR technologies brings a host of tangible benefits to Kenyan Forex traders. Firstly, the immersive environment provided by VR allows for a more profound and intuitive understanding of market trends and data analytics. Traders can visualize complex market scenarios in 3D, making it easier to identify patterns and potential trading opportunities. Secondly, VR's interactive educational programs offer a dynamic learning experience, far surpassing traditional methods. These programs can simulate various trading scenarios, from calm markets to turbulent ones, preparing traders for any situation they might face.

Despite the clear advantages, the integration of VR into Forex trading also presents barriers to entry. The cost of VR hardware and the requirement for high-speed internet connections can be prohibitive for some traders. To mitigate these challenges, Forex platforms and Kenyan government initiatives could work together to provide subsidized VR trading equipment and enhance internet infrastructure, making technology more accessible to a broader audience.

Looking ahead, the evolution of VR technology and its application in Forex trading holds promising potential. Future advancements could lead to even more sophisticated VR trading platforms that offer real-time global market simulations, AI-driven analytics within the VR environment, and more personalized VR trading experiences. As technology becomes more affordable and accessible, the adoption rate among Kenyan traders is expected to rise, setting a new standard for Forex trading globally.

As we look to the future, the integration of VR technologies in online Forex trading platforms is poised to redefine the trading landscape in Kenya. By providing immersive experiences, interactive learning opportunities, and real-time collaboration, VR has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and enjoyment of Forex trading for Kenyan traders. As technology continues to evolve, the early adoption of VR in the Forex trading community could set a new standard for trading platforms globally, with Kenya leading the way in this innovative frontier.

The integration of Virtual Reality technologies into online Forex trading platforms marks a significant milestone in the evolution of Forex trading in Kenya. By offering immersive, interactive, and engaging trading experiences, VR technology has the potential to transform the way Kenyan traders interact with the Forex market, paving the way for a more informed, educated, and collaborative trading community. As Kenya continues to embrace technological advancements, the fusion of VR and Forex trading emerges as a beacon of innovation, promising a brighter, more dynamic future for traders across the nation.",capitalfm.co.ke,news,Capital FM Kenya,,0.388235294117647,448632554,1,https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/files/2020/09/christin-hume-mfB1B1s4sMc-unsplash-1024x576.jpg,

Mercedes-Benz, meanwhile, drops plans to produce a high-riding luxury crossover sedan previewed by its Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury concept.

Planned to be unveiled midyear, the gasoline-electric Porsche is described as being ""ultra-sporty"". Porsche says it adopts measures initially developed for the company's motorsport activities, including its 963 LMDh sport prototype racing car.

The facelifted 911 Hybrid is one of four new or upgraded Porsche models planned for launch in 2024, alongside the third-generation Panamera (pictured, below), facelifted Taycan and second-generation Macan - the latter of which forgoes its traditional internal-combustion engine for an electric drivetrain.

The changes made in midcycle are intended to sustain the 911's appeal until 2027 when an all-new ninth-generation model will join the increasingly electrified Porsche lineup.

The 911's new hybrid drivetrain is expected to combine Porsche's turbocharged 3.0L horizontally opposed gasoline 6-cyl. driving the rear wheels while a specially designed electric motor powers the front axle, providing all-wheel drive.

The system uses the engine as a generator, similar to a range-extender drivetrain, augmented by brake energy regeneration, negating the need for plug-in charging.

Electric energy is stored in a lightweight lithium-ion battery. With an energy capacity well below the batteries used by Ferrari and Mercedes-AMG in their plug-in hybrid performance models, it has been configured specifically for rapid energy charge and discharge properties.

A 48V integrated starter motor in the 911 Hybrid's dual-clutch automatic gearbox will provide electric boosting properties and power for ancillary components, WardsAuto has been told.

Before the eighth-generation 911 bows out later this decade, Porsche is also set to launch an 800-hp-plus hybrid successor to the GT2 RS.

The new drivetrain has been developed via a technology transfer between Porsche's production car and motorsport divisions in combination with Rimac, the Croatian electric-drive specialist in which Porsche holds a 45% stake.

Mercedes Scrubs Maybach BEV

The defunct Mercedes-Maybach concept initially was revealed at the 2018 Beijing auto show (pictured, below). The 4-door model was conceived around Mercedes-Benz's EVA2 electric vehicle platform and was planned to be sold exclusively in China as an upmarket electric-powered rival to the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

A production version was earmarked for a joint manufacturing venture operated by Mercedes-Benz and Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. in Beijing. However, in a recent statement to German business publication Handelsblatt, Mercedes-Benz says it has decided not to proceed with production plans for the new Maybach, suggesting its Chinese market requirements are already fulfilled.

""To reduce complexity, we have decided not to continue the project of a China-specific additional vehicle based on the EVA2 architecture for the time being,"" the statement reads.

Insiders have told WardsAuto the decision was made ""several months ago.""

The reference that Mercedes-Benz will ""not continue the project...for the time being"" also suggests the plush crossover sedan may be on hold. However, the same insiders insist the project has been dropped in its current form.

""If it is resurrected, it will be on a completely new platform with an 800V architecture and with more advanced battery technology, but at this stage, it has been mothballed indefinitely,"" they say.

The abandonment of plans to produce the dedicated Maybach model comes after its CEO, Ola Källenius, announced the company is realigning its previous ""Electric First"" strategy in a move that will see existing gasoline, diesel and hybrid models continue to be produced well into the next decade.

Under the original ""Electric First"" strategy, Mercedes-Benz said it was aiming to be an all-electric brand by the end of the decade where market conditions allowed. But Källenius recently revealed new studies suggesting electrified models, including all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, would only account for up to 50% of total sales by 2030.",wardsauto.com,news,Ward's Communications Online,Greg Kable,0.1294117647058823,448632486,1,https://www.wardsauto.com/sites/wardsauto.com/files/Porsche%20911%208th-Gen.jpeg,

Many organisations have embraced the happy medium approach, combining remote and in-person work. Although the model offers certain benefits, it has also inadvertently made it easier for fraudulent activities to take place within organisations.

The hybrid work environment presents a unique set of challenges and vulnerabilities, giving rise to a range of sophisticated ""new age"" fraudulent activities and the ease with which fraudsters can conceal their activities.

Cybercrime

The risk of cyberattacks has increased significantly as a staggering amount of personal and financial data is being stored digitally and employees are connecting remotely through unsecured networks.

This, along with the use of sophisticated tactics by fraudsters to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of the organisation's IT infrastructure or the individuals involved, has led to an increase in cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, identity theft, and impersonation.

Organisations must ensure the right investments are made in the IT infrastructure and that robust security protocols are in place to avoid situations like these. Organisations must make some basic IT investments in the form of multi-factor authentication, email filtering, and anti-phishing software tools to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. Training employees on topics such as cybersecurity can also help organisations deal with various types of cyber threats.

Moonlighting or dual employment

The hybrid work environment has given rise to a culture of ""moonlighting."" Lack of oversight during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in employees taking up additional jobs for extra income, a trend we found to be more prevalent in the IT/ITES sector. Moonlighting, generally in violation of the code of conduct for most organisations (unless specifically disclosed by an employee and approved by the organisation), not only significantly reduces efficiency and productivity but also gives rise to new risks such as data leakage and IP theft.

Ghost employees are another prevalent fraud tactic in which organisations are tricked into paying money in the name of employees who do not exist. This was and still is a problem for industries that employ a considerable number of field or contractual staff.

Implementing strong, in-depth background checks on potential employees can help organisations reduce these kinds of instances. This will help organisations identify whether a potential candidate has a history of fraud, theft, or any other unethical behaviour. Organisations can proactively detect instances of moonlighting take corrective actions by being vigilant and implementing continuous monitoring measures (log-in, log-out time, efficiency metrics, etc.) in place.

Expense frauds

From duplicate bills to inflated claims, organisations have always been defrauded by employees who file false reimbursement or expense claims. However, such frauds have increased recently because of the easy availability of templates for creating fictitious documents and tools to alter the digital documents, as well as the non-availability of tools and technologies with the disbursement team to evaluate the authenticity of the supporting documents being submitted by the employees.

Organisations should invest in the latest tools and technologies that can help in digitising the supporting documents submitted by employees and performing periodic analytics on employee reimbursement data to identify duplicate claims, fictitious claims, claims exceeding pre-defined limits, etc. Advanced training for the accounts payable team to identify red flags can also help curb such instances.

This new ""future of the office"" trend has led to instances where controls often do not work as intended. One of the reasons why fraudsters succeed during crises is because organisations are typically preoccupied in dealing with immediate business issues.

As there is no one-size-fits-all approach that governs organisations on how to handle hybrid work security, it is important for organisations to be aware of the types of new-age fraud risks and have a robust anti-fraud and continuous monitoring framework in place. Organisations should foster a culture of compliance through continuous training/awareness programmes. They should be vigilant to reduce fraud losses and the associated potential reputational damage.

The USAF dream of equipping the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship with a high-energy laser weapon system has come to an end

The US Air Force (USAF) dream of equipping the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship with a high-energy laser weapon system has come to an end. In fact, as first noted by Alert 5, the US Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) has officially shelved its Airborne High Energy Laser (AHEL) program due to ""technical challenges"" encountered during integration and ground testing.

An AFSOC spokesperson confirmed to Military.com that AHEL missed its ""available integration and flight test window"" for operations from an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship amid open-air ground testing.

Aimed to provide a covert, low-collateral-damage option for special operations by disabling enemy communication nodes, light vehicles, and power infrastructure with a powerful laser beam, the AHEL was slated for airborne testing to begin in January 2024, but those plans never materialized.

The AFSOC spokesperson said that while the AHEL achieved ""significant end-to-end, high-power operation"" during ground tests, the missed integration and flight test window prompted the command to ""[refocus] on ground testing to improve operations and reliability to posture for a successful hand-off for use by other agencies.""

Airborne High Energy Laser will likely never see battle from an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship

In other words, even though the AHEL will likely never see battle from the catbird seat of a special operations gunship, it may live to fight another day as part of a different Air Force agency's directed-energy efforts. In fact, according to Alert 5, the possibility exists for the underlying technology to be adapted for other platforms. One potential beneficiary could be the Self-Protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program, which aims to integrate a laser defense system onto fighter jets for neutralizing incoming missiles.

Efforts to mount a high-energy laser on a fixed-wing aircraft were pursued by AFSOC since 2015, with Lockheed Martin receiving a contract in January 2019 to integrate and demonstrate an AHEL on an AC-130J. The defense giant delivered the system to the Air Force in 2021.

AHEL had been conceived by Lockheed Martin and was envisioned as a powerful tool for special operations, offering silent and precise engagement capabilities. Budgetary constraints played a role in the program's demise: funding for AHEL was reportedly zeroed out in the 2025 fiscal year budget request, following previous reductions in 2024 and 2023.

The YAL-1 airborne laser testbed

Actually, the US military already pondered the idea of an airborne offensive laser weapon with the the YAL-1. On Mar. 15, 2007 it conducted the first in-flight test firings of its Target Illuminator Laser (TIL). Multiple beams of photons were directed against an NKC-135E Big Crow target aircraft off the California coastline. The kilowatt-class TIL tracks a potential target and measures atmospheric turbulence for the YAL-1's main weapon, the megawatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser.

Primarily designed as a missile defense system to destroy tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) while in boost phase, the Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser Testbed (formerly Airborne Laser) weapons system was a megawatt-class chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) mounted inside a modified Boeing 747-400F.

After the first in-flight test firing at an airborne target, a high-energy laser was used to intercept a test target in Jan. 2010, and the following month, successfully destroyed two test missiles. Funding for the program was cut in 2010 and the program was canceled in December 2011. The YAL-1 performed its final flight on Feb. 14, 2012 to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (AFB) in Tucson, Arizona to be kept in storage at the ""Boneyard"" by the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG).",theaviationgeekclub.com,news,The Aviation Geek Club,Dario Leone,0.06666666666666665,448630525,1,https://theaviationgeekclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AC-130J-Laser.jpg,rus-1629187

Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar on Wednesday said National Testing Agency, responsible for conducting the CUET, will announce the cities where students have to write the test a week before the test date.

""Since this time, NTA is conducting CUET-UG in hybrid mode, we will have more centres in cities, and students will get the centres of their choice. For security reasons, students can download admit cards a few days before the test,"" he said.

These steps aim to enhance accessibility, reduce logistical challenges, and improve the overall testing experience for candidates.

Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate (CUET UG) 2024 will be conducted between May 15 and May 31, 2024.

This is the third edition of CUET UG and comes at the time of the Lok Sabha elections.

The date sheet of the CUET UG 2024 will be released after the registration process is completed on March 26, the UGC Chairman said.

Earlier, Jagadesh said, ""There will be no change in the schedule of the entrance exam view of the Lok Sabha elections.""Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar said ""This year instead of attempting 10 papers, students will be permitted to write a maximum of six papers.""""The rationale behind this decision is that only a tiny percentage of students have opted for ten papers in the last year's test. However, the scheduling of papers becomes very complex, leading to conducting the test over several days,"" Kumar said.

The UGC further said, ""Breaks will be ensured between exams held on the same day to reduce stress.""""Gap will provide students a mental and physical break, allowing them to transition between subjects and reduce stress,"" he said.

To reduce students' reliance on coaching centres, the UGC chief said the difficulty level of tests would be kept moderate.

""We want to keep the difficulty level of questions in CUET-UG moderate because students are more likely to perceive it as a fair and manageable challenge. Answering such reasonable difficulty level questions can improve students' intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, as they believe in their ability to prepare for and perform well on the test without undue external help. This positive feeling experienced by the students diffuses from one batch to another and reduces their dependency on coaching,"" he said.

Several measures have also been planned to prevent cheating during the CUET including rigorous identity verification processes, including photo identification and biometric scans to prevent impersonation.

""Seating will be arranged in a way that minimizes communication between students. A sufficient number of invigilators will be assigned to monitor the entire examination hall. While Random spot checks will be conducted during the exam,"" the UGC chief added.

""We also analyze the answers and patterns to identify any unusual trends or similarities among answers that may indicate cheating and take appropriate steps,"" he said. (ANI)",cambodiantimes.com,news,Cambodian Times,,0.1450980392156862,448630436,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ani1710932127.jpg,

New Balance, based in Birchwood, has re-submitted an application for a 75 metre wind turbine at its factory site in Flimby, after Cumberland councillors refused the initial application in August 2023, despite the plans being recommended for approval by officers.

The refusal of the plans was made due to 'planning matters raised by the community, regarding the potential for adverse impacts on the amenity of local residents, risk to employee and public safety in relation to the turbine being within topple distance of the factory and ecological impacts on protected species' with councillors saying the application had not alleviated local community concerns in order to enable community support of the scheme.

At the meeting in August last year, Seaton councillor, Jimmy Grisdale claimed there was 'a danger of the turbine toppling over' and he moved that they reject the application quoting various planning policies to support going against the officer's recommendation to approve the plan.

He said: ""This will affect the local community.""

The company re-submitted the plans on March 14, saying there is a business need to build the turbine which will 'generate enough energy to meet 100 per cent of the factory demand on site', with rooftop solar already providing approximately 30 per cent of the electricity at the Flimby factory.

It has also submitted an appeal to the Secretary of State alongside this resubmission.

The company has said that there the application is a commitment to the site at Flimby, which employs over 300 people in the community.

Documents supporting the application said: ""As a business New Balance takes its climate responsibilities very seriously and has committed through RE1003 Climate Group to sourcing 100 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025 across all global New Balance operations.

""Any excess power would ideally be 'passed through' to the Warrington head office and retail sites.

The company, a division of OEG Energy Group, has won a six-month contract from developer Scottish Power Renewables to locate and eliminate wartime whoopsies littering seabed soon to be occupied by the developers' East Anglia 3 project.

Based on the 66-metre Glomar Wave, Hughes Subsea's team is tasked this summer to search for and eliminate unexploded ordinance (UxO) littering the 300 square kilometres of the proposed park.

With its subsea robots and its highly trained, very careful divers, Hughes will find, investigate and dispose of remaining mines laid eighty years ago to defend England's coast. Still active bombs jettisoned by the Luftwaffe or by US & RAF planes returning to East Anglian airfields will also be on the professionals' hit list.

Maritime archaeologists will also be enlisted to handle historic findings, and marine mammal observers will support the monitoring of local wildlife, including seals.

Located 70 kilometres off Great Yarmouth, East Anglia 3 will when complete comprise as many as 100 turbines towering 260 metres above the North Sea. Nearly 150 kilometres of cables will link the finished venture's structures and a marine converter station.

The venture has a rated capacity of 1.4GW, capable of making clean electricity for more than a million homes.

At the recent News18's Rising Bharat Summit 2024, Nitin Gadkari, the Minister of Road, Transport & Highways, voiced a compelling proposition for the future of eco-friendly transportation in India. Emphasizing the need for a greener environment, Gadkari suggested a significant reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on hybrid vehicles from the existing 43% to a mere 12%. This proposal marks a pivotal moment in India's journey towards sustainable mobility.

Know how many types of Hybrid Vehicles are there in India

During his address, Gadkari pointed out the current disparity in the tax rates for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid cars. With EVs enjoying a low 5% GST rate, the hefty 48% levied on hybrids seems disproportionate, considering hybrids' considerable environmental benefits over traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. ""Hybrids, which operate 60 percent on electricity and emit far less pollution, deserve a more favorable GST rate to encourage their adoption,"" Gadkari argued. He highlighted his intentions to discuss this issue further with the Finance Minister at the upcoming GST Council meeting, aiming to align hybrid vehicle taxation closer to that of EVs.

Lowering the GST on hybrid vehicles could catalyze a significant shift in India's automotive landscape. Such a move is expected to not only boost the sale of hybrid and electric vehicles but also foster innovation in eco-friendly transportation technologies. By reducing dependency on imports and curbing pollution levels, this tax revision could contribute to India's economic and environmental well-being. The automotive sector, being a major contributor to the nation's GST revenue and a key player in the global export market, stands to gain substantially from this policy change.

Gadkari's vision extends beyond immediate benefits, foreseeing India as a leading automotive manufacturing hub within the next five years. This ambition is supported by India's recent achievement of surpassing Japan in new car sales, positioning it as the third largest market globally.

The minister's commitment to sustainable transportation was further evidenced by his arrival at the summit in a Toyota Innova equipped with a flex engine, capable of running on both petrol and ethanol. Highlighting the cost-effectiveness and environmental advantages of ethanol fuel, Gadkari underscored the importance of adopting flex-fuel technology across various vehicle segments, including two-wheelers and public transport.

On a somber note, Gadkari shed light on the alarming rise in road fatalities, with annual deaths increasing from 1.5 lakh to 1.65 lakh. A majority of these victims are young individuals aged between 18 and 34, a statistic that underscores the urgent need for behavioral change and stricter adherence to traffic regulations.

The union opposes having one hosting party, where everyone should be able to run the server, create an account on it and then use the same services. This ensures that there is no problem if one hosting party is offline, as the data is spread out.

For example, look at Twitter. If you want to use this, you can only do so via Twitter's servers themselves, so you must also agree to their terms and conditions and trust that they will handle your account information correctly. The standard variant of this is the Mastodon. Anyone can run their own Mastodon server, which means there are plenty of alternatives with their own data handling and terms of use. This means that you can ""simply"" choose the server that suits you the most in terms of rules and privacy (or create your own!) and create an account on it. With a regular service, this means that you can only communicate with other users on that specific server, which causes massive fragmentation, but it's true. this That's the power of how federation is used: With an account on Server A, you can still reply to a post from someone on Server B.

In the backend, standards are defined and used to enable federation, of which ActivityPub is one.

Some standardized alternatives on other services/websites:

There are also some disadvantages to using union. For example, resource usage for server administrators; Because it facilitates communication between servers, any activity on the server should generally be propagated to the servers that also retrieved that information, so that those servers keep connecting again and again to retrieve the data. In addition, what is active and what is inactive varies for each server: some servers do not always make federation possible, depending on the server's purpose. In this case, it's mainly about not relying on God's grace (read: big tech companies), for example what the government did: News: Dutch government starts Mastodon instance for government accounts

Federation is currently mainly useful/interesting to enthusiasts (in the broadest sense of the word, this may be due to technology, privacy aspects or something else) due to drawbacks and effort for both server administrators and ordinary users. But that doesn't make it any less legitimate; The more widely it is used, the more you can expect the technology itself to improve.",houstonianonline.com,news,Houstonian,Courtney Horton,0.2078431372549019,448629415,1,,eng-9413755

Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar on Wednesday said National Testing Agency, responsible for conducting the CUET, will announce the cities where students have to write the test a week before the test date.

""Since this time, NTA is conducting CUET-UG in hybrid mode, we will have more centres in cities, and students will get the centres of their choice. For security reasons, students can download admit cards a few days before the test,"" he said.

These steps aim to enhance accessibility, reduce logistical challenges, and improve the overall testing experience for candidates.

Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate (CUET UG) 2024 will be conducted between May 15 and May 31, 2024.

This is the third edition of CUET UG and comes at the time of the Lok Sabha elections.

The date sheet of the CUET UG 2024 will be released after the registration process is completed on March 26, the UGC Chairman said.

Earlier, Jagadesh said, ""There will be no change in the schedule of the entrance exam view of the Lok Sabha elections.""

Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar said ""This year instead of attempting 10 papers, students will be permitted to write a maximum of six papers.""

""The rationale behind this decision is that only a tiny percentage of students have opted for ten papers in the last year's test. However, the scheduling of papers becomes very complex, leading to conducting the test over several days,"" Kumar said.

The UGC further said, ""Breaks will be ensured between exams held on the same day to reduce stress.""

""Gap will provide students a mental and physical break, allowing them to transition between subjects and reduce stress,"" he said.

To reduce students' reliance on coaching centres, the UGC chief said the difficulty level of tests would be kept moderate.

""We want to keep the difficulty level of questions in CUET-UG moderate because students are more likely to perceive it as a fair and manageable challenge. Answering such reasonable difficulty level questions can improve students' intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, as they believe in their ability to prepare for and perform well on the test without undue external help. This positive feeling experienced by the students diffuses from one batch to another and reduces their dependency on coaching,"" he said.

Several measures have also been planned to prevent cheating during the CUET including rigorous identity verification processes, including photo identification and biometric scans to prevent impersonation.

""Seating will be arranged in a way that minimizes communication between students. A sufficient number of invigilators will be assigned to monitor the entire examination hall. While Random spot checks will be conducted during the exam,"" the UGC chief added.

""We also analyze the answers and patterns to identify any unusual trends or similarities among answers that may indicate cheating and take appropriate steps,"" he said.

Their main advantage is that they use their batteries to enhance fuel economy, making them very fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly. There are many reasons why someone would want to lease a hybrid vehicle.

If you're considering leasing a hybrid as your next car of choice, but are unsure of the benefits, stick around. In this article, we will be discussing the full advantages of leasing a hybrid vehicle and what this can mean for you.

IMAGE: UNSPLASH A Hybrid Vehicle Is Fuel Efficient

One of the main benefits to leasing a hybrid vehicle is for the fuel efficiency. Hybrid vehicles are designed to be fuel efficient, as combining the internal combustion engine with an electric motor results in better fuel economy, as well as maintaining fantastic performance.

Leasing a hybrid can lead to significant savings on fuel costs compared to conventional petrol and diesel vehicles, which is another reason as to why they are a popular leasing option.

Environmentally Friendly

By far one of the biggest advantages to leasing hybrid vehicles is knowing that they are the better option for the environment.

With much fewer emissions than traditional petrol and diesel cars, hybrid vehicles are a great alternative for those who want to lower their carbon emissions and have a better impact on the environment. Leasing a hybrid promotes cleaner air and sustainability, which is something to consider.

Tax Incentives

Leasing a hybrid vehicle can save you money on tax. This is because the road tax rate is based upon tailpipe emissions, meaning the lower the emissions that your vehicle makes the less tax you'll pay.

As hybrid vehicles release less co2 emissions than traditional vehicles, you'll end up saving money on tax. Electric vehicles emit no tailpipe emissions as they rely fully on their battery, making them the kind of vehicle that benefits the most from road tax savings.

Reduced Maintenance Costs

Hybrid vehicles often have fewer maintenance requirements compared to their petrol counterparts. The regenerative braking system, for example, reduces wear on brake components, which can potentially lead to lower maintenance costs over time.

When it comes to car leasing, maintenance is usually not included in standard deals, but it can be added on as a package depending on your car leasing provider.

Advanced Technological Features

Hybrid vehicles, especially newer models typically come equipped with the latest advancements in technology and safety features. This allows those who lease hybrid vehicles to enjoy the latest technology and benefit from the safety features that these vehicles offer.

Leasing allows individuals to experience what driving a hybrid vehicle is like, without the commitment of ownership.

Easier Transition To Full Electric Vehicles

If driving an electric vehicle is your aim, the hybrid vehicles are an excellent way to get your foot in the door.

Hybrids are a mix between traditional petrol cars and fully electric vehicles, offering the individual familiarity as well as venturing into the territory of electric vehicle driving.

Scientists from South Korea have conducted a feasibility analysis for combining thermoelectric generators (TEGs) with heat pumps coupled with photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems.

TEGs can convert heat into electricity through the ""Seebeck effect,"" which occurs when the temperature difference between two different semiconductors produces a voltage difference between two substances. The devices are commonly used for industrial applications to convert excess heat into electricity. However, their high costs and limited performance have thus far limited their adoption on a broader scale.

The researchers said TEGs are critical for achieving zero-energy buildings (ZEBs), although they still do not supply sufficient power for building heating and cooling systems due to low electric generation at present. ""Indeed, the ongoing technological advancements in thermoelectric materials are anticipated to yield greater energy recovery potential. Consequently, it is imperative to undertake a comprehensive feasibility assessment concerning the integration and advancement of TEG applications,"" they added.

In their work, the researchers sought to harness temperature differences in the inlet and outlet pipes of a heat pump to generate additional electricity. For this purpose, they designed and modeled a hybrid system for a residential house consisting of a PVT with an electric efficiency of 16%, a ground heat exchanger (GHE), and hot storage tank (HST) units.

Modeling

They also modeled a 10.5 kW water-to-water heat pump, with supplementary heating and cooling provided by a fan coil unit. A solar storage tank (SST) was used for additional flow adjustment control. The TEGs were installed on the inlet and the outlet of the PVT, GHE, and HST and had an application of 0.1 m × 1 m in each unit.

""The electric generations of TEG are compared based on conversion efficiency (zT),"" the research group explained. ""The electrical power generation of TEG produced in each unit was calculated with a zT value of 1. A commercially available thermoelectric element has a zT value of approximately 1, with a conversion efficiency of 10-15%.""

The modeled house was assumed to be located in Seoul, South Korea, and temperatures and solar irradiation were simulated between November and March. The maximum solar radiation during the heating period was 899.7 W/m2, while the daily average solar radiation was 247.7 W/m2.

According to the research team, solar radiation and external temperature significantly impacted the heat exchange rate of the PVT and, therefore, its ability to generate electricity in the TEG. The TEG produced 85 Wh in November, 18 Wh in December, 8 Wh in January, 44 Wh in February, and 196 Wh in March.

""During the coldest month of the year, January, the GHE was used to heat the house rather than the circulating water stored in the PVT. Thus, considerably less electricity generation was achieved in January compared to other months, resulting from the limited number of operating days of the PVT and the absence of temperature differences between the inlet and outlet,"" they explained.

In contrast, the GHE was able to maintain a constant temperature difference of approximately 4-6 C between the inlet and the outlet, resulting in more stable production. The TEG produced 591 Wh in November, 1,170 Wh in December, 1,389 Wh in January, 1,050 Wh in February, and 675 Wh in March.

For the HST, the water outlet temperature was 42-47 C, while the inlet temperature varied depending on heating demand. This led the TEG to record a generation of 768 Wh in November, 1,309 Wh in December, 1,530 Wh in January, 1,196 Wh in February, and 921 Wh in March.

Feasibility

""In this study, the area of TEG necessary to accomplish a ZEB was estimated,"" the researchers said, noting that the heat pump used 10,413 kWh of electricity throughout the heating period, while the PVT produced 3,432 kWh. ""Therefore, additional power of 6,980 kWh was needed to accomplish a ZEB, and the installation area of the TEG based on zT was computed for additional power generation. Here, the installation area for the TEG application corresponds to the length of the pipe. When zT was 1, the required TGE installation space in each unit was calculated at 64.5 m2.""

The team concluded that the electricity generation of the TEG applied to the active system was ""relatively small,"" and a large area was needed to deliver additional power to the heat pump.

ore test centres, examination in hybrid mode, timely availability of admit cards, scheduling breaks between exams held on the same day and moderate difficulty level in tests are among the initiatives outlined by the University Grants Commission to ensure smooth and hassle-free CUET-UG.

Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar on Wednesday said National Testing Agency, responsible for conducting the CUET, will announce the cities where students have to write the test a week before the test date.

""Since this time, NTA is conducting CUET-UG in hybrid mode, we will have more centres in cities, and students will get the centres of their choice. For security reasons, students can download admit cards a few days before the test,"" he said.

These steps aim to enhance accessibility, reduce logistical challenges, and improve the overall testing experience for candidates.

Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate (CUET UG) 2024 will be conducted between May 15 and May 31, 2024.

This is the third edition of CUET UG and comes at the time of the Lok Sabha elections.

The date sheet of the CUET UG 2024 will be released after the registration process is completed on March 26, the UGC Chairman said.

Earlier, Jagadesh said, ""There will be no change in the schedule of the entrance exam view of the Lok Sabha elections.""

Speaking to ANI, UGC chief M Jagadesh Kumar said ""This year instead of attempting 10 papers, students will be permitted to write a maximum of six papers.""

""The rationale behind this decision is that only a tiny percentage of students have opted for ten papers in the last year's test. However, the scheduling of papers becomes very complex, leading to conducting the test over several days,"" Kumar said.

The UGC further said, ""Breaks will be ensured between exams held on the same day to reduce stress.""

""Gap will provide students a mental and physical break, allowing them to transition between subjects and reduce stress,"" he said.

To reduce students' reliance on coaching centres, the UGC chief said the difficulty level of tests would be kept moderate.

""We want to keep the difficulty level of questions in CUET-UG moderate because students are more likely to perceive it as a fair and manageable challenge. Answering such reasonable difficulty level questions can improve students' intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, as they believe in their ability to prepare for and perform well on the test without undue external help. This positive feeling experienced by the students diffuses from one batch to another and reduces their dependency on coaching,"" he said.

Several measures have also been planned to prevent cheating during the CUET including rigorous identity verification processes, including photo identification and biometric scans to prevent impersonation.

""Seating will be arranged in a way that minimizes communication between students. A sufficient number of invigilators will be assigned to monitor the entire examination hall. While Random spot checks will be conducted during the exam,"" the UGC chief added.

""We also analyze the answers and patterns to identify any unusual trends or similarities among answers that may indicate cheating and take appropriate steps,"" he said.

""It is my privilege to address the Summit for Democracy and share the democratic achievements and aspirations of the Republic of Armenia.

The agenda of democratic reforms remains a top priority for our government. As a result, according to the reports of the Freedom House, Armenia has been ranked as a 'Free Internet' country several years in a row. We have registered improvement of Global Freedom Index, advancing our positions by 2 points within one year. Armenia has also registered progress in the World Press Freedom Index and improved its positions by 2 points in 2023.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The fundamental question that arises among democracies nowadays is whether democracy can deliver security and stability. Over the past several years we have experienced multiple times how democratic institutions can ensure internal stability.

On the other hand, Armenia has been attacked by some external undemocratic forces through military and hybrid means that targeted not only the territorial integrity and independence of our country, but democracy as well. And we decided to join the International Criminal Court to protect our independence, territorial integrity and democracy.

Being committed to the peace process with Azerbaijan, Armenia views its security primarily in peaceful coexistence and cooperation with its neighbors in the region and beyond. Hence, the project 'Crossroads of Peace' introduced by the Government of the Republic of Armenia aims to contribute to the security, stability and peace in the South Caucasus. This project is another indicator of my Government's commitment to contribute to the lasting peace and security in the region by means of cooperation.

The new model is a mild-hybrid proposal that makes the car much more affordable compared to the battery-electric variant. 12 photosPhoto: Lancia The Italian car manufacturer says the ICE Ypsilon uses a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine with 48-volt tech. It enjoys 99 hp (100 ps/74 kW) and has an e-DCT with six forward gears. It is clearly no record-breaker, as the 0-62 mph (0 to 100 kph) acceleration is dealt with in 9.3 seconds, and it has a 118 mph (190 kph) top speed.

According to Lancia, the partially-electrified Ypsilon can travel on zero emissions over short distances in crowded cities. The fuel consumption is rated at the equivalent of 51.1 US mpg (4.6 l/100 km/61.4 UK mpg). It features an 11.6-gallon (44 liters) fuel tank and emits 103 g/km of CO2.

Unfortunately, the company hasn't released additional specifications. It did, however, say that this model features electronic functions such as the e-Creeping, e-Queuing, w-Parking, and e-Start, adding that it offers ""versatility and respect for the environment.""

Photo: Lancia Lancia's mild-hybrid version of the new-gen 2024 Ypsilon comes in the same configuration as the electric model. Thus, you are looking at the Cassina Limited Edition. It has LED headlamps, 17-inch diamond-cut alloys, and a few other things. It also has a 10.25-inch infotainment system and an equally-sized digital gauge cluster, and it benefits from Level 2 semi-autonomous driving.

Save for the additional intakes in the front bumper and a visible exhaust tip with a cutout in the rear bumper, the ICE-powered Lancia Ypsilon looks the same as the EV variant. Nevertheless, despite being modest, these design changes are enough for anyone to tell it apart, regardless of whether they are looking at the front or the rear end.

Local pricing starts at €28,000, which comes out to $30,410 at the current exchange rates. This makes it way more affordable than the EV version in the same Cassina configuration, which is a €40,000 ($43,440) affair in Italy. Choosing the all-quiet model will give customers an electric motor driving the front wheels, which generates 154 hp (156 ps/115 kW) and 192 lb-ft (260 Nm) of torque. Backing it up is a 51 kWh battery pack, which enables a 250-mile (403 km) range on the WLTP test cycle.

Lancia also offers the mild-hybrid 2024 Ypsilon with a €6,538 ($7,100) deposit and 35 monthly installments of €200 ($217). At the end of the period, customers can either replace or return the car or keep it by paying the remainder €18,512.8 ($20,105).

This weekend's Australian GP represents one such epoch, with the race representing the 10th birthday of the modern turbo-hybrid era.

READ MORE: Marko casts HUGE Mercedes move verdict after Wolff offer

Heading into the 2014 Australian Grand Prix, we had Red Bull Racing coming off a long winning streak after their lead driver dominated the prior season and fans full of hope that the new regulations would stop them.

Elsewhere, Daniel Ricciardo spent his previous year hoping for a Red Bull seat, people had doubts over Lewis Hamilton's recent decision to move away from his long-time team, and Ferrari hoped to make a step forward to stop leading the best-of-the-rest behind the frontrunners...

It sounds like a familiar story, but despite the parallels, the F1 world has a decade of development between then and now.

Mercedes nailed their turbocharged V6 engine to become the dominant force for most of the subsequent years, kicking off this new-look period of F1, but Nico Rosberg took the win in Melbourne, not teammate Hamilton.

Rosberg is the unsung hero from the turbo-hybrid era of the sport thanks to his shock post-title departure, but people should remember how much the 2016 champion brought to the sport outside of that championship-winning season.

There are a lot of complaints about Max Verstappen's dominance today, with fans understandably frustrated that they know the victor of a race from the moment the Dutchman survives any opening-lap misfortune.

Although a different section of the fanbase was the one grumbling, we heard the same annoyances through most of Hamilton's 2017-2020 seasons.

Not so in 2014, 2015, and 2016, though, thanks to Rosberg pushing the now seven-time champion to battle for the pole positions and wins with equal machinery.

READ MORE: Hamilton demands 'BIG changes' amid Mercedes frustration

That's not to say Rosberg's presence made these early turbo-hybrid years some must-watch racing, but it did have a championship fight last longer than what we have today, particularly in 2014 and 2016.

Nonetheless, Mercedes' superiority then was arguably far clear of today's ground-effect Red Bull, with the Hamilton-Rosberg pairing bringing 32 1-2 finishes in that period.

The winning driver's advantage was seldom as sizeable as in recent years because the two racers kept each other close, but the gap behind the Silver Arrows makes Red Bull look relatively pedestrian.

Take the 2015 Australian GP, for example, when Hamilton's pole was six-tenths ahead of Rosberg and 1.4s better than Felipe Massa's P3 effort before the two blitzed the other 18 drivers by 34s in the race.

Mercedes controlled the sport back then to similar or higher levels than Red Bull on raw pace, but the subplot of the internal team battling kept things feeling less stale at the sharp end.

Yes, Hamilton had an easier time once Rosberg walked away; the quickly established pecking order between him and Valtteri Bottas had far fewer explosive fireworks, with 2019 and 2020 being low points on the excitement scale.

Red Bull's recent years have seen them exceed on a different level to their German rivals in those early years of the regulations.

Without a similar-level driver next to Verstappen in the garage, the ruthless efficiency of the partnership is almost robot-like, sorely missing some a joker card or other jeopardy.

That might change in the turbulence following Christian Horner's investigation, but wherever the team goes from here, there's no denying Adrian Newey's aerodynamic excellence has numbed the sport for many.

Combining the turbo-hybrid regulations with 2022's updated ground-effect rules has let Newey's genius shine, and having a talent like Verstappen in the car his brain created has proven devastatingly destructive for everyone else.

Sadly for many viewers, they are part of the 'everyone else', and the gap between Verstappen and Sergio Perez means there are no top-team flashpoint moments like the 2016 Spanish GP crash, the 2014 Belgian GP 'absolutely unacceptable' contact, or even the low-stakes cap-throwing playground drama at the 2015 USGP.

Both teams have enjoyed their dominance, but friction is necessary for compelling viewing, and that's been sorely missed over the past few years.

Ten years of turbo-hybrids haven't all been single-team supremacy snoozefests, though.

Regardless of your view on the final miles of the 2021 season, that year will go down as one of the sport's best in history, with the back-and-forth between two teams and drivers at their best.

We've also had Verstappen's ascent from Toro Rosso's 17-year-old Max Crashstappen in 2015 to the three-time champion we have today, with countless 'simply lovely' drives even before his regularly winning ways.

Equally, we've had the downfall of Sebastian Vettel, entering the regulations looking unbeatable but failing to score a single victory in the season following his last title.

Fernando Alonso's odd journeyman career of hoping to land in the best team rather than build one up has had the Spaniard have four employers plus enjoy a two-year retirement and become a two-time Le Mans victor, too.

With Bernie Ecclestone moving aside for Liberty Media, many of these stories have had blockbuster movie-like treatment that has revolutionised how everyone consumes the sport.

Yes, the turbo-hybrid decade has been one of domination, but as we celebrate its 10th anniversary, let's remember that we've had 10 seasons of evolution, too.

It's a timely reminder that, no matter how it may seem in the moment, change is happening now, and the sport won't be as it is today forever.",gpfans.com,news,GPfans,Jim Kimberley,0.4588235294117646,448625114,1,https://sportsbase.io/images/gpfans/copy_1200x800/4d952028caf30751bec0f46f28430f55274cf519.jpg,eng-9408564

Satellite messengers represented a huge improvement in modern communication technology, particularly in distant and off-grid locations in which traditional means of contact were frequently unreliable or non-existent. The devices, which are often small and portable, employ an orbiting satellite network to allow users to send and receive messages, make calls, and even relay GPS coordinates from nearly anywhere on the Earth. This breakthrough transformed outdoor activities like trekking, mountaineering, and sailing by providing a lifeline to those exploring the wilderness, letting them stay connected with loved ones or call for help in an emergency.

Europe was the highest-growing market among all the regions, registering a CAGR of 13.69%. Europe is anticipated to gain traction in terms of satellite messengers adoption owing to the growing adoption of satellite communication in diverse sectors in the region. Moreover, favorable government policies are also expected to support the growth of the satellite messengers market in North America and Europe during the forecast period.

The history of satellite messengers is a fascinating journey that spans several decades, marked by technological improvements and changing customer demands. The notion of satellite messengers dates back to the late twentieth century when satellite communication technology was first developed. Companies such as Iridium and Globalstar began creating satellite networks for worldwide communication in the 1980s. These networks, however, were largely used for voice and data communication rather than the specialized purpose of personal safety and outdoor adventure that current satellite messengers are renowned for.

Additionally, the first-generation specialized satellite messengers for personal use were released in the early 2000s by companies such as SPOT LLC and DeLorme (later bought by Garmin). These early satellite messengers allowed users to send pre-defined messages, check in with their position, and request help in an emergency. These devices were a big step forward in improving outdoor enthusiasts', hikers,' and adventurers' safety and communication capabilities in distant locations where standard cellular networks were unavailable.

Furthermore, satellite messenger technology has evolved over time, becoming smaller, more durable, and more feature rich. The addition of two-way communication and GPS tracking capabilities constituted an important turning point in the business. Users may not only send but also receive messages, as well as indicate their precise position to friends, relatives, or emergency services.

Companies such as Garmin, SPOT, and inReach by DeLorme (now Garmin) have been at the forefront of these developments, providing a variety of satellite messenger alternatives specialized to specific outdoor activities. Also, satellite messengers are becoming an indispensable tool for adventurers, explorers, and outdoor lovers. In distant places, they give a connection to the outside world, ensuring safety and peace of mind while allowing users to share their experiences with loved ones. The history of satellite messengers illustrates a continual dedication to developing technology and communication, allowing people to stay connected and secure in even the most difficult situations on Earth.

Additionally, another area where the satellite messenger industry has had a big economic impact is in the energy and natural resources sector. Oil, gas, and mining firms frequently operate in isolated, dangerous settings with little access to standard communication infrastructure. Satellite messengers have proven to be important tools for staying in touch with field personnel, guaranteeing their safety, and remotely monitoring equipment and operations. These industries have improved not just their safety procedures but also their operations, resulting in higher production and reduced downtime.

Subsequently, the satellite messenger market's industrial effect goes far beyond its traditional outdoor and emergency uses. Through the integration of satellite messengers, the logistics and transportation, energy and natural resources, and agricultural and maritime sectors have all seen major improvements in their operations, safety measures, and overall efficiency. As technology advances, it is conceivable that even more sectors will find novel methods to use these gadgets, resulting in more industrial transformation and productivity gains.

Today we learn about one of its killer features - meal planning. According to Korean sources, the Samsung Mobile eXperience division (MX) and the Home Appliance department are working together to link Samsung Food with the Galaxy Ring.

This means that Samsung wants to provide meals and diet suggestions using the smart ring.

Galaxy Ring will monitor your activity during the day, and then Samsung Food, linked to a smart Samsung fridge with AI vision, will provide diet suggestions based on calorie consumption and body mass index (BMI).

In a real futuristic home where the Samsung oven is also linked, the appliance will apply the cooking temperature and time accordingly, and ingredients can also be delivered through the Samsung e-Food center.

This all sounds lovely in theory, but the reality is that most of these products and services are still available only in Korea and the appliances cost a lot. Nevertheless, once this feature is launched, we might see the effect snowball and other companies jump the hype train.

Samsung Food, on the other hand, is a platform currently available in 104 countries and regions.

The combination of PROCLANE's extensive experience in the integration of SAP ERP and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE and connectiv!'s expertise in the implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE enables both companies to offer their customers high-quality solutions.

As an SAP-certified iPaaS solution, PROCLANE IntegrationMan (iMan) acts as the central middleware for system integration. This allows data to be exchanged efficiently between the two systems without inconsistencies or data loss. iPaaS offers companies flexibility and cost efficiency when integrating different systems, both in the cloud and on-premise, as well as improved agility through rapid adaptation to changing business requirements and comprehensive security functions for data management.

As an additional added value, PROCLANE Integration provides in-house developed SAP function modules that are made available to customers in the SAP partner namespace. In contrast to SAP's standard modules, which are not always suitable for these specific master data processes, the function modules developed by PROCLANE ensure efficient and customised handling of master data processes. Communication via SAP IDocs is also frequently used.

For over 25 years, connectiv! has been an IT specialist for SMEs in the fields of digital commerce and customer engagement for over 25 years. With complex eCommerce platforms, web portals and interfaces or with professional customer engagement solutions based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE, the company enables successful networking of strategy, process, people and technology.

Emil Hadner, Managing Director of PROCLANE: ""The combination of our expertise in SAP integration and connectiv!'s implementation expertise for Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE will enable us to offer our customers a seamless and effective solution that optimises their business processes and improves their customer view.""

Hermann Silies, Managing Director of connectiv! eSolutions GmbH, was also positive about the cooperation: ""The partnership with PROCLANE is a great opportunity to join forces and offer our customers first-class solutions. We look forward to working together on future projects and helping our customers achieve their goals.""

The integrated solution from PROCLANE and connectiv! will enable companies to maximise the benefits of SAP and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE and improve their business processes. The two companies look forward to expanding their collaboration and working together to support customers in their digital transformation projects.",pressebox.com,news,pressebox.com,,0.2549019607843137,448621816,1,https://cdn.pressebox.de/a/014517742c618523/attachments/1453797.attachment/filename/Desktop-News+%E2%80%93+connectiv-proclane+%E2%80%93+1.png,eng-9405547
