In 2023, 62 Kenyan start-ups raised an estimated $673.78 million from local and international investors, a rise from the $574.8 million raised in 2022, even as the rest of the continent saw a drop in funding, data by start-up research organisation, Disrupt Africa shows.

Nigeria and Egypt, which dominated the start-up funding space in Africa over the past decade, 2023 recorded a drop, which resulted from a global slowdown in investments due to a cocktail of macroeconomic challenges across the world.

""Unlike elsewhere on the continent, Kenya's total funding is up,"" said the report published this week. ""Kenya had an overall positive year in 2023, with its total amount of funding actually rising on 2022 levels, although the number of start-ups to secure funding was down like most other destinations.""

In Kenya, most of the funding raised last year went to energy start-ups, with off-grid solar pay-as-you-go firms M-Kopa and Sun King raising $465 million, or 69 percent of the start-up funding received.

Sixteen of the companies were fintechs, nine were e-commerce businesses, seven agri-tech, and five were in health-tech and logistics technology.

""Though the number of start-ups to raise funding in 2023 was down, Kenya nonetheless bucked pan-African trends with the total amount of funding growing, as well as the level of employment created by the start-up ecosystem.""

Twenty-five, or 36 percent, of the 69 start-ups raised at least $1 million last year, a drop from 49 in 2022, but still a higher proportion than in other countries on the continent.

In Africa, the number of funded start-ups dropped from 633 in 2022 to 406 last year, with the total amount raised dropping 28 percent to $2.4 billion, from $3.3 billion the previous year.

Of the four African countries that have traditionally dominated start-up funding on the continent, two saw a drop.

Nigeria's total investments shrank almost three times from $976 million in 2022 to $399.9 million last year.

Egypt's start-up investments also dropped from $811 million to $590 million in that period, while South Africa's rose to $512 million, from $329 million in 2022.

The tracked funding for Africa came from different sources, with venture capital, development financial institutions and angel investors, injecting mostly equity investments (89 percent), and a few debt investments (11 percent).

""The perceived risk of African tech start-up investments means companies remain much more likely to raise equity capital, but later-stage start-ups, especially those in the energy sector, are increasingly able to take on debt funding, and this year in particular some earlier-stage ventures have taken on debt as bridging capital as VC funding declines,"" says the report.

Disrupt Africa tracks funding for African start-ups, and where funding amounts are not publicly disclosed, it uses estimates based on funding institution's standards or history of funding, or hints given by the recipient, meaning the estimated values could be slightly lower or higher than the actual.

The African Venture Capital Association (AVCA), which publishes an annual report of venture capital activity on the continent, is yet to publish the 2023 results, but all indications are that even VC funding generally saw a drop last year.

Tel Aviv [Israel], March 24 (ANI/TPS): Israel's Foreign Minister praised the US Congress' decision to halt funding to UNRWA (the UN Relief Workers Agency for Palestinians) calling the move ""a clear vote of no confidence in UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres."" US President Joe Biden is expected to sign into law the appropriations bill that cut the funding.

The move came several months after Israel released evidence that many UNWRA workers in Gaza are actually Hamas terrorists, some of whom even took part in the October y massacre.

""Anyone who refuses to condemn Hamas's crimes and fails to respond to calls for the dismissal of UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini must go home themselves.""

""The historic ban on US funding to UNRWA that passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and cannot be part of the solution.

Chip Roy (R-TX) denounced the $1.2 trillion spending bill that was signed by President Joe Biden this weekend, describing it as a bipartisan financial failure.

""We're $34.5 trillion [in debt],"" he said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. ""Both parties are equally to blame over that time. Both parties. The uniparty, the entire establishment in Washington, keeps spending money we don't have, racking up debt to advance policies that are undermining our safety and well-being.""

Biden signed the bill hours after Congress sent the legislation to his desk, despite missing a midnight deadline to avert a partial, temporary shutdown.

Biden signing the bill into law means the government is now funded through the end of fiscal 2024. Congress and the White House will have just over six months to agree to funding for the next fiscal year.

Roy said that along with deficit spending, Congress is failing voters by failing to secure the southern border.

""Laken Riley, who dies because of mass parole policies, releasing people into the United States,"" he said to CNN. ""That man, the suspect, was released under those policies, against the law. She dies. We've got hundreds of examples like that.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has filed a motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) over the funding bill, which, if successful, would make him the second speaker removed during this year's budget process.

A specific timetable for when the motion will be voted on, or if it would pass, is unknown, but it appears likely to be dealt with when the House returns from recess in April.

Roy mostly avoided the topic when asked about it, calling it ""beltway palace drama"" that intrigues the Washington press rather than voters. But he acknowledged, ""It's a very difficult job for the speaker.""

He also said that Ukraine funding should not be approved until the southern border is secure.

Real estate investing was once an exclusive club of the wealthy. They were the only ones with the access and finances to invest in income-producing commercial real estate. That gave wealthy investors an advantage because they could use real estate to build and sustain their wealth.

That's no longer the case. Anyone can invest in wealth-creating real estate through real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other options. However, while the door is open to anyone to invest in real estate, the ultra-wealthy invest more money into alternative investments like real estate than other investors. Here's a closer look at the data on why wealthy investors gravitate toward alternatives like real estate and why others should consider following the money and increasing their allocation to real estate.

According to a survey by alternative investment manager KKR, high-net-worth families allocated 11% of their portfolio to real estate. That was third behind listed equities at 31% and private equity at 27%.

The wealthy have a meaningful allocation to real estate because it has proved to be a solid investment. Over the past decade, real estate has returned 8.8% annually, based on the NCRIEF Property Index. That has significantly outpaced the 1.5% annual return over the past decade of bonds, which many wealthy investors use to help diversify their portfolios, reduce risk, and generate income. Real estate can accomplish those goals while delivering a higher total return thanks to property value appreciation. On top of that, it has tax advantages and benefits from inflation, something bonds don't offer.

Real estate's diversification benefits are noteworthy. A major reason the wealthy invest in alternatives is to reduce their exposure to public stock and bond markets. Alternatives like private equity and real estate deliver returns that are less correlated to the daily gyrations of the public markets, which can help investors reduce volatility and enhance returns.

Congress created REITs in 1960 to empower anyone to invest in income-producing and wealth-creating real estate. All you need to do is open and fund a brokerage account to start investing in REITs. Here are two solid options for beginners:

Realty Income (O -0.78%) is a diversified REIT that invests in free-standing retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties. It signs long-term net leases for these properties with high-quality tenants. Net leases make the tenant responsible for covering real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance costs. Wealthy individuals will often invest in net lease real estate because these properties are more passive investments compared to other types of real estate investment.

The REIT pays a monthly dividend that currently yields 5.9%. It has increased its dividend 124 times since its public market listing in 1994, growing the payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate. That growing income stream and rising property values have enabled Realty Income to deliver a strong 13.9% compound annual total return since it came public. Shares of the REIT only cost around $50 a piece, making it a very affordable investment.

Invitation Homes (INVH -1.45%) is a residential REIT focused on single-family rental homes. Many people start investing in real estate by purchasing a rental property. Invitation Homes is an easier way to get started. It offers instant diversification, owning or managing over 100,000 homes across 16 markets, and does so for a very low cost, considering shares are about $35 apiece.

The REIT pays a quarterly dividend that yields 3.2%. Invitation Homes is better than owning a rental property because it supplies truly passive income. You don't need to manage tenants or deal with unexpected repairs, which can turn a property from a money maker into a money pit in no time. Invitation Homes has historically supplied investors with a steadily rising passive income stream. It has increased its dividend every year since it came public in 2017, including by nearly 8% late last year.

Congress leveled the playing field to enable anyone to invest in income-generating real estate by creating REITs. Technology and additional legislation have made private real estate more accessible in recent years. Several online platforms have launched to enable anyone to invest in private real estate to benefit from the additional diversification these non-correlated investments offer. Notable options include:

The wealthy have historically invested in real estate because it's a solid investment. It generates passive income, delivers attractive returns, and has other benefits.

However, you don't have to be wealthy to invest in real estate. Anyone can invest in wealth-creating REITs or private real estate through an online portal. Real estate can help you diversify your investments and build wealth, making it a solid addition to any portfolio.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Matt DiLallo,0.2941176470588236,448987140,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770334/a-person-holding-a-magnifying-glass-looking-at-a-row-of-rising-coins-and-buildings.jpg,eng-9421810

Over the past decade, real estate has returned 8.8% annually, based on the NCRIEF Property Index. That has significantly outpaced the 1.5% annual return over the past decade of bonds, which many wealthy investors use to help diversify their portfolios, reduce risk, and generate income. Real estate can accomplish those goals while delivering a higher total return thanks to property value appreciation. On top of that, it has tax advantages and benefits from inflation, something bonds don't offer.

Real estate's diversification benefits are noteworthy. A major reason the wealthy invest in alternatives is to reduce their exposure to public stock and bond markets. Alternatives like private equity and real estate deliver returns that are less correlated to the daily gyrations of the public markets, which can help investors reduce volatility and enhance returns.

Congress created REITs in 1960 to empower anyone to invest in income-producing and wealth-creating real estate. All you need to do is open and fund a brokerage account to start investing in REITs. Here are two solid options for beginners:

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a diversified REIT that invests in free-standing retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties. It signs long-term net leases for these properties with high-quality tenants. Net leases make the tenant responsible for covering real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance costs. Wealthy individuals will often invest in net lease real estate because these properties are more passive investments compared to other types of real estate investment.

The REIT pays a monthly dividend that currently yields 5.9%. It has increased its dividend 124 times since its public market listing in 1994, growing the payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate. That growing income stream and rising property values have enabled Realty Income to deliver a strong 13.9% compound annual total return since it came public. Shares of the REIT only cost around $50 a piece, making it a very affordable investment.

Invitation Homes (NYSE: INVH) is a residential REIT focused on single-family rental homes. Many people start investing in real estate by purchasing a rental property. Invitation Homes is an easier way to get started. It offers instant diversification, owning or managing over 100,000 homes across 16 markets, and does so for a very low cost, considering shares are about $35 apiece.

The REIT pays a quarterly dividend that yields 3.2%. Invitation Homes is better than owning a rental property because it supplies truly passive income. You don't need to manage tenants or deal with unexpected repairs, which can turn a property from a money maker into a money pit in no time. Invitation Homes has historically supplied investors with a steadily rising passive income stream. It has increased its dividend every year since it came public in 2017, including by nearly 8% late last year.

Congress leveled the playing field to enable anyone to invest in income-generating real estate by creating REITs. Technology and additional legislation have made private real estate more accessible in recent years. Several online platforms have launched to enable anyone to invest in private real estate to benefit from the additional diversification these non-correlated investments offer. Notable options include:

The wealthy have historically invested in real estate because it's a solid investment. It generates passive income, delivers attractive returns, and has other benefits.

However, you don't have to be wealthy to invest in real estate. Anyone can invest in wealth-creating REITs or private real estate through an online portal. Real estate can help you diversify your investments and build wealth, making it a solid addition to any portfolio.

Chip Roy (R-Texas) said Sunday he opposed the $1.2 trillion bipartisan spending bill last week because he wanted to see a ""sense of sanity on spending.""

""I didn't want to get everything right. I mean, I wanted to, but I knew I wouldn't get everything I wanted. But you know what I wanted? I wanted some sense of sanity on spending, some sense of sanity on the border. Some sense of sanity on any of the issues the American people actually care about, and we got none of that,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""We got a doubling down on the very thing that the people who sent me to Washington, and I believe the vast majority of Texans and Americans are frustrated with,"" he added.

Roy said last week that Republicans who back the funding bill ""are the ones risking the election."" The House ultimately passed the massive funding bill in a Friday vote despite opposition from hardline conservatives.

President Biden signed the bill into law Saturday morning after the Senate approved it early that morning to prevent a government shutdown.

When asked what he would have done on this legislation, Roy said he would have stuck with the bipartisan budget caps agreement struck by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Biden last year.

""I would have stuck with the bipartisan caps that were passed on a majority basis out of the House and the Senate, I would have passed the CR that would have triggered the caps. We get a constrained spending. We would have defense flat. We would have cut the bureaucracy, and then we could have got busy trying to negotiate on border security,"" Roy said.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,0.003921568627450966,448986413,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/roychip_012924gn02_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640,

The Nebraska Association of Behavioral Health Organizations -- better known as NABHO -- which represents community mental health and substance abuse providers, said the cuts, which are part of a broader sweep of unspent funds, will reverberate across the state.

""This is a point in time where reducing funding for behavioral health care is the last thing we should be doing,"" NABHO Executive Director Annette Dubas said on Thursday. ""Building capacity and assuring access to care must be a priority.""

Last week, state senators rejected a floor amendment from Omaha Sen. John Fredrickson that sought to retain $12 million of the funds for behavioral health providers in this year's mid-biennium budget adjustments bill.

The other $3 million in funding under Fredrickson's plan would have been transferred to the Lincoln Regional Center to address nursing staff shortages.

Instead, the Legislature chose to follow through with the Appropriation Committee's original proposal to shift those funds to the Regional Center as part of a plan.

""Any one of us in the field or who has experience around this knows we don't have excess funds,"" said Fredrickson, a mental health professional. ""If anything, we have a shortage of funds.""

Fredrickson told NABHO members in the Rotunda at the Capitol that while the budget has not been sent to Gov. Jim Pillen -- the Legislature will take it up for the third and final round of consideration on Tuesday -- the vote made it ""pretty clear"" where his colleagues stood.

Still, he added that if the entirety of the funds shifted to support the Regional Center were not needed, there was a chance they could be reallocated to their original purpose.

""It's difficult when you pit nursing versus behavioral health because both need to be funded,"" Fredrickson said. ""It shouldn't be an either-or thing, it should be a both-and thing.""

But members of NABHO, including providers, county officials and parents of individuals who need behavioral health services, said the move was shortsighted and would result in more crime, drug use and homelessness.

They also predicted it would put strain on the budgets of local governing bodies that fund law enforcement activities, as well as hospitals that end up treating those individuals in lieu of a trained behavioral health specialist.

Tim Heller, the chair of the State Advisory Board for Behavioral Health, said his son ""has been navigating what Nebraska calls its behavioral health system for many years now"" as someone who experiences severe and persistent mental illness.

""It's broken,"" Heller said of Nebraska's system of supports, ""and our problems are only going to get worse.""

While services are already under strain in rural and urban areas of the state alike, Heller said individuals experiencing mental illness often find themselves in local jails waiting on a bed to open up at the Lincoln Regional Center.

Or, they fill up emergency rooms as they seek help, which puts more pressure on medical professionals rather than connecting them with the right kind of treatment they need, he said.

""Going forward, we need to invest in more beds and more providers and better access to care, upgrading our facilities, better treatment plans,"" Heller said. ""Nebraskans deserve better.""

Gale Pohlmann, a Jefferson County Board of Commissioners member who also serves as the chair of the Region V Systems governing board, said the cuts are ""in direct contrast with what we know is a behavioral health crisis occurring statewide.""

Cutting the safety net, Pohlmann added, would mean individuals who need ""someone to respond and somewhere to go"" when experiencing a behavioral health crisis will instead fill up emergency rooms and jails -- at the expense of local taxpayers.

""Now is not the time to reduce the allocation of funds in our behavioral health system which supports people with mental health and substance use challenges,"" Pohlmann said. ""Nebraskans deserve better than continuing with status quo when we know behavioral health conditions continue to present noteworthy challenges to the people in our communities and our system.""

And Carole Boye, president and CEO of Community Alliance, a nonprofit behavioral health organization that operates in the Omaha area, said the number of Nebraskans who have experienced a mental health challenge has risen from 1 in 5 before the COVID-19 pandemic to 1 in 3 today.

""Make no mistake about it, the dollars that are being swept up and out of the behavioral health system will result in real consequences,"" Boye said.

For example, the loss in funding will result in 75 people losing access to behavioral health services at Community Alliance, Boye said, while 50 people or more may lose the opportunity for specialized employment supports to get them back on their feet.

""These are real reductions being faced within just one agency,"" she said. ""Similar consequences will be felt across the state.""

While Pillen and senators have stated the reduction is an effort to recapture unspent funds, Boye said those funds are key to maintaining existing services or responding to new demands.

The warning from behavioral health providers that a loss of funding could result in dire consequences for the state echo a similar call from those who care for individuals of developmental disabilities earlier this month.

Advocates for those providers said chronically low reimbursement rates have resulted in longer wait times for the developmentally disabled along with staffing issues.

""Insurance costs are up by $1.2 million. Pensions are up. Utility costs are up. Trash and recycling is up,"" Gillian said in his recent address to City Council. ""We face the same increases that everybody else does.""

City revenues are also up, he said, with an increase in the cost of beach tags driving a record $6 million in income, and increasing ratables will also help, Gillian said.

The total assessed value of the city is $12.77 billion, up more than $216 million from the year before. The real market value of the properties in the city is higher than that.

City Finance Director Frank Donato plans to provide a detailed look at the budget proposal at the March 28 council meeting, 10 a.m. at City Hall, 861 Asbury Ave. At the same time, he plans to discuss the city's capital plan.

That could allow council to vote to introduce the budget in April. It would still require a public hearing and final vote before taking effect.

As proposed, the budget includes an increase of 3.71 cents on the tax rate per each $100 of assessed property value, for a proposed new rate of 53.41 cents. That would mean that if the budget is approved as proposed, the owner of a house assessed at $600,000 would owe $3,204.60 in municipal taxes, in addition to county and school taxes.

This is Gillian's 14th State of the City address, and in his comments to council, he emphasized the investments made in roads, drainage, land acquisition, public safety and quality-of-life matters.

Gillian: The state of Ocean City is strong

On March 14, Mayor Jay Gillian presented his annual State of the State address to City Council, which included a proposal for a $110 million budget. His address was posted to the city website, as follows:

""When we set out a decade ago to fix flooded streets, pave roads, acquire open space, rebuild the Boardwalk, dredge the bay and do all the other things that our residents deserve, our Finance Department outlined a schedule that would cost about a penny a year on our tax rate -- or about $75 a year for the owner of a home assessed at $750,000,"" Gillian said in his prepared comments. ""While paying an extra $75 a year for this work, the owners of the same home have seen the value of their home increase by hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

He cited the city's acquisition of a former car lot near the community center.

""We're going to own this land forever, and it will create a corridor of public space that Ocean City has not seen since the Lake Brothers preserved a block-wide corridor from beach to bay between Fifth Street and Sixth Street for what became parks, schools, public buildings and the Tabernacle. That was 140 years ago in 1884,"" Gillian said.

City plans include a new police substation on the Boardwalk, with extensive renovations to the existing public safety building to follow. Gillian also cited a plan for a new Bayside Center at Fifth Street and Bay Avenue, part of that bay-to-city corridor he mentioned, and a new terminal building planned for the Ocean City Airport.

The city recently signed contracts with employee unions, Gillian said.

""The contracts were fair to the city team and responsible to taxpayers,"" he said. ""The salary increases reflect the inflation we've seen over the past few years. They are one of the biggest factors in this year's proposed budget and they include new employees in Public Works, Police Dispatch and Social Services.""

Gillian presented a rosy picture of the city and the work of his years as mayor. He lauded the beaches, the downtown shopping district, the Boardwalk, the airport and golf course, and a community center that includes a fitness center, museum, library, café, arts center and a senior center the city has recently taken over from the county.

""That's really the most important thing to remember when we talk about the state of the city. Owning a home here remains the best investment anybody can ever make. And there will never be a better place to live,"" Gillian said.

Rubicon was joined by climate investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions and Silversmith Capital Partners.

This funding round will accelerate Ascend's product innovation and expand its suite of analytics solutions, enhancing the company's ability to serve energy market stakeholders navigating an increasingly complex power grid. Dr. Gary Dorris, who co-founded the company in 2002, will continue leading the company as CEO while also assuming the role of chairman.

Ascend's products enable utilities, renewable developers, independent power producers, financial institutions, and other energy market stakeholders to develop, finance, and optimize energy assets in an increasingly complex energy market landscape. This year, utilities in the US have nearly doubled the projections for power generation by 2028 to accommodate growing demand - which was sparked by an uptick in manufacturing and an explosion of new data centers and other factors.

As more electricity is generated from renewable sources susceptible to weather-related interruptions, utility providers that can model volatility into their approach have a critical advantage. Ascend's ability to provide energy analytics in a commercial context enables its customers to translate new and clean power sources into actionable insights and economic opportunities.

The company's product suite includes BatterySIMM (recognized as the de facto standard for energy storage modeling and development), PowerSIMM (a resource selection and portfolio management solution), and SmartBidder (an energy storage bidding optimization platform). And the company's existing customer base includes some of the largest utilities and renewables developers in North America and Europe.

KEY QUOTES:

""For multiple decades, Ascend's mission has been to help its customers realize their energy transition objectives. Having now reached an inflection point in the transition, this partnership allows Ascend to grow at the speed and scale necessary to meet the moment. We are so proud of everything our team has accomplished, and although we are veterans in the sector, it feels like we are just getting started.""

- Dr. Gary Dorris, CEO and co-founder of Ascend

""From day one working with Gary and team, their unmatched expertise and thought leadership in an incredibly dynamic energy market were unmistakable. The energy market turns to Ascend for its most complex problems, given its highly differentiated suite of software and services. We couldn't be more excited to partner with Ascend to continue innovating and advancing its products to meet customers' evolving needs.""

- Alison Beyer, Principal at Rubicon Technology Partners

""Even before meeting Gary and his team, we understood that Ascend was unique, having established itself as the go-to provider for utility-scale storage software, intelligence, and valuation solutions. Ascend's superior information and analytics capabilities are distinctly suited to support power market participants in navigating complex grid dynamics driven by escalating load growth, distributed generation, and higher penetration of renewables.""

- Saloni Multani, Co-Head of Innovation + Expansion at Galvanize Climate Solutions

""We back founders who know their markets so well that they find the gaps and seams to build big, important businesses where others didn't see the possibility. We believe Gary is just that type of visionary founder and we are thrilled to be joining our friends at Rubicon and Galvanize in supporting him during the next phase of Ascend's journey.""",pulse2.com,news,Pulse 2.0,Amit Chowdhry,0.3411764705882352,448985063,1,https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2024/03/Ascend-Analytics-Logo.jpeg,

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is advancing its operations through prudent integrations of AI, which its CEO describes as having the potential to increase its network by 50% and increase business efficiency by 30%. As such, this seems like a prudent time to become or to stay an EA shareholder. In addition, based on my value analysis, the company looks moderately undervalued based on my conservative model, and it has a strong capital structure compared to its peers.

Electronic Arts, also known as EA, is a leading global interactive entertainment business well known for its catalog of video games, which span console, PC, mobile and other devices. The majority of EA's operating revenue comes from sales related to consoles. Consider the following business and geographic breakdown of operating revenue:

Recently, Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO, expressed his positive sentiments about the role generative AI will play in potentially making game development more efficient by 30%. Currently, game development cycles can last up to six or seven years, and AI should help to significantly shorten this by automating specific tasks. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Mr. Wilson mentioned the full effects he expects from the integration of AI into game development:

If you fast forward this over a five-year-plus time horizon, you think about where we've gotten to in terms of efficiency, what I would like to believe is 30% more efficient as a company, where we can attract 50% more people into our network, and hopefully by virtue of the nature of the content that we can create through generative AI, which will be created faster, and more personal to every player, then there's 10 to 20% more monetization opportunity to us on an ARPU level. - Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson

I think this is an extremely strong position for EA to be taking, considering this is a time when generative AI has the capability to make or break many companies, particularly in the field of technology. EA's intent to aggressively adopt AI places it at the forefront of revolutionary capabilities that should drive significant benefits for shareholders in terms of income and cash flow. While its ambition to attract 50% more people into its network is ambitious, it is achievable if it drives brand awareness with surplus capital generated from lower headcount as a result of some automated development processes.

Readers will notice from the quote that higher efficiency is not all that Mr. Wilson wants to use AI for. He also plans to leverage AI for deeper personalization within games, adding new features that he believes will drive customer acquisition through better quality and fuller gaming experiences. This is a significant factor he believes will contribute to his 50% network expansion goal. Consider that in EA Sports FC 24, generative AI has increased player run cycles from 12 in FIFA 23 to 1,200, massively improving in-game details.

I'm both amused to see what EA creates and cautiously optimistic about the outcome. I believe mastering AI for creative pursuits requires a fine line drawn between heightened efficiency and careful human direction. Without the latter and too much emphasis on the former, the company runs the risk of gameplay becoming artificial, stale and lacking in spirit.

While AI is a significant core growth driver for EA in the coming years, there are other high-value changes the firm is making to drive expansion and shareholder value. For example, it is establishing Ridgeline Games, which is a new studio led by the co-creator of Halo, Marcus Lehto. Its focus will be narrative campaigns in the Battlefield universe, and the initiative showcases the firm's significant commitment and investment to quality in content, showing its recognition of the continued need for great human talent at the forefront of its creative strategy.

But its Battlefield universe plans do not stop there. It is also planning the coordination of multiple studios, including DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, and Industrial Toys, among others, to turn Battlefield into a higher-value first-person-shooter series.

What first comes to mind is that EA is going to compete more significantly with Microsoft (MSFT) and its Activision subsidiary who own the Call of Duty series. I believe the competition here is very high, and CoD could be an unbeatable nemesis for EA. Yet, EA's ambition and direction seem apt to me, with unfortunately higher trends toward militarism across the world right now; one fortunate effect on gaming companies that embody army narratives is higher enthusiasm from the gaming community for their products. I have witnessed this enthusiasm firsthand from my connections to and time spent around military servicemen. Higher government spending on defense leads to higher recruitment budgets, which leads to higher enthusiasm for military careers, which in turn generates enthusiasm for war games.

In terms of investment case analysis but also operational threat, EA faces significant competition from the following companies. I have included only a few that focus solely on gaming and are of similar market cap to EA for the purposes of thorough financial peer comparison to come:

First of all, let's look at the four peers I have outlined on specific metrics. Firstly, net income margin. Not only can we see that EA has the highest net margin of the four at the time of this writing, but it is also the only one not to be operating at a loss. Consider that in 2019, when all of the firms other than Roblox commanded a net profit, EA was still the leader. This track record is a significant strength for EA:

Also, consider how EA has much higher YoY revenue growth at this time compared to its peers, and once again, it has managed to command a leading position quite consistently:

Lastly, consider the following breakdown of each firm's balance sheet:

Notably, Roblox has considerably worse financials at this time as it is a very new company in comparison to the others, with its IPO in just 2021. Nonetheless, of its peers, EA commands what I consider to be the best balance sheet of them all, with a healthy amount of total equity compared to assets and a lot of cash on hand to pay off its moderate amount of debt. My balance sheet analysis makes EA look very good indeed against its peers.

EA's cash flow statement also shows further strength. Specifically, it does not issue debt frequently, with only two issuances over the past decade, and while its repayments are also infrequent, they are sufficient given its equity-to-asset ratio of 0.55. Its high repurchase of common stock every year is also warranted by the well-managed balance sheet, and this is significantly increasing shareholder value. It does issue common stock almost every year on record but at a minuscule proportion to the amount it repurchases. I like the financial management of the company a lot, and I think it shows a prudent awareness of the need to not be overleveraged whilst also highly valuing shareholder interests. While not perfect, its capital structure is hard to find significant fault in.

EA is currently selling at a GAAP price-to-earnings ratio of 33.5, which is very close to its five-year average of 34. Yet, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.81 is a -17.78 % difference from its five-year average of 35. As such, I believe there is a compelling opportunity here in terms of the stock valuation to buy good growth at a reasonable price.

The significant potential discount of around 18% is aided by 10.5% EPS growth expected on consensus for fiscal 2024, 6.6% expected for fiscal 2025, and 11.69% expected for fiscal 2026.

As the company typically trades at around a 50% premium to the industry median P/E ratio, I have discounted this from the indicated 18% margin of safety based on EA's historical forward price-to-earnings ratios versus its present forward price-to-earnings ratio. Therefore, my estimated margin of safety for the stock at this time is 9%.

Readers should bear in mind that I have not included a P/E comparison to my group of peers as they are all trading at a loss at this time other than EA, so it would not be meaningful.

While I have attempted to add a layer of conservatism to my value analysis by integrating a discount based on the difference in the value of EA to the entire industry, there is some doubt that this is enough of a security measure to guard against not performing a discounted cash flow analysis. However, multiple analysis becomes one of the only ways to properly gauge a fair stock price when high levels of investor sentiment are present, as forecasted earnings unfortunately do not capture this. Nonetheless, if investor sentiment changes, even if the fundamentals are strong, the stock could see a significant drop in price.

Additionally, there is an opportunity in this new age of artificial intelligence for disruptive new game studios to transform what is popular in the industry, and I believe EA will face significant competition in new technologies, consoles and platforms that could reduce its market share unless it makes careful acquisitions, strategy pivots and hires the right people to remain relevant. It is taking all of the correct steps with its aggressive integration of AI at this time, but as immersive content becomes more available and user-friendly, EA might find it is out of its depths with its current infrastructure.

Overall, EA stock is a Buy based on my analysis. I consider it to be extremely well-positioned in the industry, with prudent future operational strategies and very well-managed financials. I would be surprised if it doesn't outperform the S&P 500 (SP500) over the next 10 years, and based on its integration of AI for efficiency and customer acquisition, its returns could be higher than in the past decade.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Oliver Rodzianko,0.4745098039215687,448984531,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/458083957/image_458083957.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

The Trump campaign later stated that the prime minister met with the former president ""to discuss a wide range of issues affecting Hungary and the United States, including the paramount importance of strong and secure borders to protect the sovereignty of each nation.""

As we settled down for a pre-dinner Beatles and Rolling Stones tribute band concert in the Mar-a-Lago grand ballroom, former President Trump informed the crowd of the Hungarian prime minister's arrival to enthusiastic applause.

After the music, I was joined by media personalities James O'Keefe, John Fund, and NY Post Op-Ed Editor Kelly Torrance. They were guests at media consultant and former NY Post Page Six columnist Douglas Dechert's dinner party, where appropriately sophisticated banter was exchanged over drinks and sumptuous fare from the lavish buffet.

Although I was unable to hear the conversation between the two leaders that evening, Mr. Orban, a leading European critic of the war in Ukraine, told a Hungarian M1 broadcaster that the 45th President had a ""detailed plan"" to end the bloody conflict once he returned to the White House.

The prime minister suggested that if a second Trump administration severely curtailed American aid to Ukraine, ""Europeans on their own will not be able to finance this war, and then the war will end.""

For years, the Hungarian prime minister was at odds with other European leaders over his tough stand on the foreign migrant crisis, his social conservatism, and his passage of constitutional amendments and laws opposed by Brussels.

Ms. Torrance, who said she greatly enjoyed the ""wild scene"" at Mar-a-Lago and is a vocal supporter of American aid to Ukraine, commented that ""Orban declared Trump would end aid to Ukraine -- but the summary from Trump's side of the meeting did not even mention Ukraine.""

""Orban makes the same mistake many do about Ukraine. Critics think Ukrainians only fight because of Western money. That's not true. I spent nearly a month there last year. They fight for freedom, and they will do so to the death. America used to be pro-freedom-fighter. America used to be proud of its role as an inspiration to the world,"" Ms. Torrance added.

The NY Post editor, who believes Mr. Orban to be ""pro-Putin,"" told me that she was surprised that the Hungarian leader approved Sweden's bid for NATO membership after he blocked it for months.

""He's trying to play both sides, perhaps,"" she hypothesized.

""The whole Ukraine aid debate is also incredibly silly because we are not giving a blank check to Ukraine. The vast majority of money in every aid package is spent here in America. We are giving Ukraine old equipment and spending those aid funds on replenishing our stocks with new stuff. Most of the money is being spent in factories right here in America,"" said Ms. Torrance.

In response to his guest's support of continued American aid to Ukraine, Mr. Dechert said: ""All anybody needs to know about the U.S. taxpayer-funded national money laundering operation in Ukraine is that if the WEF/Davos globalists and their tyrannical deep state handmaidens are for it, then any rational American patriot should be against it.""",pjmedia.com,news,PJ Media,,0.2627450980392156,448984317,1,https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/66/8d0291ce-bad8-48af-b657-7386d36c9cbf.png,

Despite financial struggles, Wayne's passion for honoring heroes at the Alamo shines through. Wayne's dedication to The Alamo paid off with an Oscar win, inspiring a less successful 2004 remake.

For decades, John Wayne, best known for True Grit, The Searchers, and Stagecoach, wowed audiences everywhere as a Western star. To this day, there isn't a name more associated with the genre than Wayne's, and his legacy has remained a strong staple well into the 21st century. But back in 1960, the Duke put it all on the line when he made The Alamo, a historical war picture that took a deeper look at the infamous ""Battle of the Alamo,"" a conflict between Texas and Mexico in 1836. But this motion picture nearly bankrupted the Western legend, who also directed and produced the film, leaving an interesting legacy behind of its own as a result.

The Alamo (1960) ApprovedAdventureDramaHistory

In 1836, a small band of soldiers sacrifice their lives in hopeless combat against a massive army in order to prevent a tyrant from smashing the new Republic of Texas.

Release Date October 27, 1960 Director John Wayne Cast John Wayne , Richard Widmark , Laurence Harvey , Frankie Avalon Runtime 162 minutes Writers James Edward Grant 'The Alamo' Was a Passion Project for John Wayne

There's no doubt that John Wayne was a man of passion, and often played similar Western heroes on screen in an effort to build the myth of John Wayne that has continued to exist in Hollywood long after his death in 1979. But about twenty years before he passed, the Duke worked hard to bring the story of the Alamo to the big screen. According to historians Randy Roberts and James S. Olson in their book, A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory, Wayne began development on The Alamo back in the late 1940s, and was working with Republic Pictures on the film until the studio axed the project due to budget concerns (Wayne wanted $3 million to make the movie). That script eventually became The Last Command, and was made without Wayne's involvement. Soon after, the Duke established Batjac Productions alongside producer Robert Fellows, which would be the production house he'd use to see the project through.

John Wayne couldn't be kept from the Alamo forever. The Duke took some time to regroup and rework the project, and would eventually revisit it with Angel and the Badman partner James Edward Grant writing the picture. Wayne originally had no interest in starring in the picture and was solely interested in directing, but eventually, he was forced to take on the leading role of Davy Crockett when money continued to be an issue. When Wayne went looking for other financial backers to bring his enormous vision to life, he was forced to make a deal with United Arists. The studio offered the Duke a considerable $2.5 million in addition to being The Alamo's distributor, but only if Wayne would also star. Additionally, as Roberts and Olson note, ""Batjac, Wayne's own company, would have to invest $1.5 to $2.5 million"" as well. Despite the terms, Wayne accepted the deal, though that still wasn't enough to make The Alamo... at least not on the incredible scale he was hoping for.

According to Roberts and Olson, Wayne went to Texas oilmen such as Clint W. Muchison and brothers I.J. and O.J. McCullough for more funding, eventually convincing the businessmen to invest in the film about their rich history. Their only stipulation was that it be shot in Texas, which the Duke agreed. Years later, the Western icon revealed that he was forced to use his own funds to continue making the picture, putting about $1.5 million into the film after taking out second mortgages and putting up his own vehicles for collateral. But why did he do such a thing? Well, he saw Davy Crockett and the other men who died at the Alamo as heroes, and for years he fought to honor them the only way he knew how: by making a movie about them.

John Wayne Wasn't Concerned With 'The Alamo's Budget

""What kind of men were they? Well, we know that they died and that they were heroes, but nobody wants to die and nobody just decided to be a hero. It has to be forced on you, and that's what happened to them,"" Wayne explained when promoting the film, which was released in October 1960. But more than that, the Duke had become obsessed with the story, which many believe may have been something of a midlife crisis for the actor, who had skirted the draft during World War II to continue making Westerns in Hollywood. ""I think making The Alamo became my father's own form of combat,"" Wayne's daughter Aissa later hypothesized in A Line in the Sand. ""More than an obsession, it was the most intensely personal project in his career.""

While The Alamo didn't do exceptionally well either critically or at the box office, it was still Wayne's first official directing credit (he went uncredited for his work on 1955's Blood Alley). ""It's costly, and that's the only question they ask me, Tim, is how much did it cost?"" Wayne told ITN's Tim Brinton in 1960 following the premiere. ""And I think that is unimportant. We spent as much money as it would take to make this picture in the best manner it could be made. I wish that every picture could have that opportunity, but there are a lot of subjects that can be made that wouldn't cost this kind of money."" For Wayne, The Alamo wasn't something he was willing to give up on. It took the Duke over a decade to get the movie made, and he eventually succeeded in bringing the tale to life. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and took home the Oscar for Best Sound in 1961.

Decades later, The Alamo would be remade in 2004 with Billy Bob Thornton and Patrick Wilson in the leading roles. The film was a box-office bomb and, despite its concern about the history of the Alamo (something Wayne's film played fast-and-loose with), it wasn't quite the exciting war drama that the Duke's original was. Not only that, but it's soulless attitude toward the material paled in comparison to Wayne's genuine passion for the project. No, Wayne's Alamo wasn't exactly the most historically accurate, but the Duke had given it his all, and that shone through despite its flaws.

Footage from 'The Alamo' Was Used in 'How the West Was Won' Close

Of course, the legacy of The Alamo doesn't just end with the 2004 remake. Footage from the production of The Alamo would later be repurposed into John Ford's segment of the Western epic How the West Was Won, which featured John Wayne as General William Sherman. While the timeline between The Alamo and How the West Was Won is off (the former took place in 1836 while the events of the latter take place during the American Civil War), Wayne allowed Ford to use shots from The Alamo, particularly of Mexican soldiers marching on. ""The film did, however, include a shot of Santa Ana's massed army advancing on the Alamo, taken from The Alamo,"" noted pop culture historian Sir Christopher Frayling in his introduction to How the West Was Won, as evident in Cinema Retro Magazine. ""Which may well have involved one of Ford's contributions to the second unit on that film.""

Related John Wayne Lost an Oscar to a Film He Absolutely Hated John Wayne didn't just lose an Oscar... he lost a Best Actor Academy Award to a movie he despised to his core.

Following the mixed reception to The Alamo, Wayne continued to make pictures that proved his worth as an actor and a filmmaker. He went on to make The Comancheros, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Big Jake, The Cowboys, True Grit, and eventually his final picture, The Shootist. He received no credit for his directorial work on The Comancheros or Big Jake, though he is the credited director of The Green Berets, a less well-known project than The Alamo. Many believe that, due to the large sums he invested in The Alamo, Wayne continued making so many Westerns into the 1960s and 1970s because he was in financial need, but whether that's true or not, the Duke was always one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. Be it near the beginning of his career with movies like Stagecoach or at the tail end with pictures like Rooster Cogburn, John Wayne always worked hard to bring his characters to life, but perhaps he never worked as hard as he did with The Alamo.

The Alamo is available to watch on Prime Video in the U.S.

However, experts believe that telcos will need to follow a differential pricing strategy for entry level to ensure that low-income consumers are not forced to give up their mobile plans.

20% hike in prices

After nearly two years of stable telecom tariffs, brokerage firms predict that telcos will take another 20 per cent hike in telecom prices. In January, Bank of America Securities upgraded Bharti Airtel's ratings expecting a significant tariff increase after a two-year hiatus. India has the cheapest telecom tariffs in the world, and increasing telecom prices has been a catch-22 for telcos, as Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea followed the race to the bottom strategy for pricing to garner subscribers. This has come at the cost of margins for telecom operators, especially Vodafone Idea which has been facing liquidity issues for many years.

As telecom operators increased capital expenditure to set up the 5G network last year, it became important for them to take tariff hikes, which they have not been able to take as elections loom near. However, brokerage firms have stated that telcos will take tariff hikes post July, ranging from 15 to 20 per cent.

In the winter of 2021, telecom operators had taken tariff hikes on entry level and postpaid plans. businessline did a report in February 2022, which found that millions of consumers were forced to give up their mobile subscriptions as a result. Data by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India found that 1-2 million subscribers dropped their mobile phone subscriptions in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

While experts at the time said that many of these lost subscriptions were secondary sim cards of consumers who were on mobile plans of two operators, entry level subscribers likely also faced the brunt of these tariff increases. At the same time, Reliance Jio carried a culling exercise to improve the quality of their subscriber base, disconnecting ""inactive subscribers,"" or pre-paid subscribers that had not renewed their subscriptions for a few months. These subscribers are usually low-income customers, like migrant laborers, underemployed workers that can only afford luxuries like phone connectivity when they get a paycheck or have to send money back home.

Consumers at the edge of the poverty line will be affected by these tariff hikes. Faisal Kawoosa of TechArc explained, ""Most high- or middle-income consumers will not be affected by these tariff hikes. They have already optimised for rising telecom tariffs by removing their secondary sim or reducing the number of mobile plan subscriptions per household. But low-income consumers will see impact.""

Use of AI

Kawoosa believes that telcos will need to be more circumspect on how they raise their tariffs to ensure that low-income customers are not affected. ""Telcos can use AI, or provide voice only plans to differentiate customers at the entry level. Ensure that they are still able to afford mobile connectivity.""

Keeping entry level subscribers connected is essential because it could impact the delivery of government services. Many government programmes are linked to Aadhar which, in turn, is linked to the phone.

In his statements, Schinas congratulated the Mayor and his team for the ""very impressive work"", adding that ""in this fourth visit to Cyprus during my mandate, I wanted to get to know the very important work that has been done in Larnaca, the restoration of historical monuments with Community funding, because culture is part of my portfolio.""

At the same time he wished ""Larnaca to succeed in becoming the European Capital of Culture for 2030"", adding that ""we will help as much as we can in this effort"" and congratulated all responsible parties.

Replying to a question on EU funding, Schinas said that ""as is the system in Cyprus, we have both the traditional Cohesion Fund and the resources for the Turkish Cypriot community, since many restorations were funded. The result is that the European taxpayer supports and highlights our roots,"" he said.

He also noted that ""as we approach the European elections and the Europhobic and extreme voices of some people who want to convince us that Europe is destroying our roots are growing, I invite them to come to Larnaca to see that Europe and funding are highlighting our roots, they are safeguarding our national origins.""

Greek Cypriot Co-Chairman of the Technical Committee for Cultural Heritage Sotos Ktoris expressed his gratitude to the European Commission ""for its unwavering support and generous aid which over the last 15 years has allowed for the conservation of over 140 monuments across the island's territory.""

""This is an effort that does not just contribute to the preservation of the monuments bequeathed to us by history,"" he noted.

He also underlined the ""crucial role that the European Union plays in Cyprus, through the support it gives us, in promoting conditions of peace and reconciliation between the communities of the island.""

For his part, Mayor of Larnaca Andreas Vyras expressed his satisfaction for the presence of the Vice-President of the European Commission in the city, adding that without these funds ""it would be impossible to improve the quality of life of our fellow citizens, to beautify and change our city.""

He noted that in recent years ""Larnaca has received more than 70 million euros for important projects and works with which we have solved important daily problems of the city, such as flooding"", adding that several other projects have been carried out which have strengthened the culture and economy of the city.",parikiaki.com,news,Parikiaki,,0.4745098039215687,448982700,1,https://parikiaki-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24131932/cache_780x1200_Analog_medium_6424467_1866953_22032024061911.jpg,

In doing so, they are debating how much funding will be available for our counties, cities, towns, villages and water districts to prevent water pollution and update our water and wastewater infrastructure - the systems that bring clean water to our homes and take dirty water away. The sources of our clean drinking water are precious and need to be preserved. In addition, our water infrastructure is very old and needs a lot of updates to prevent pollution. In every corner of our state, municipalities need funding to modernize drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

It is unusual that clean water funding is part of the state budget debate. Our state leaders know the importance of clean water and have worked across the aisle to upgrade water infrastructure, protect clean water, and prevent pollution from reaching our lakes, rivers, streams, bays, and harbors.

For the last eight years, New York State has dedicated at least $500 million a year to update our water infrastructure. These investments have been vital for Long Island, funding new drinking water main replacements, sewage treatment plant and septic system upgrades, lead pipe replacement, toxic site remediation, and much more. These investments also help unlock millions in federal funding for local projects, a huge help to our municipalities.

Despite these critical investments, more is required. In fact, the total statewide need is estimated to be more than $80 billion over the next two decades. We must not only continue clean water investments across New York, we should increase them to meet the overwhelming need.

Yet, this year, Gov. Kathy Hochul's executive budget proposal included a 50% cut to funding for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act. This comes as the state's water infrastructure is deteriorating and failing. We need more state funding for clean water infrastructure projects, not less. According to the governor's office, the latest round of Clean Water Infrastructure Act grants created 24,000 jobs across the state.

This year, state funds can go even further than in years past because right now, for a limited time, there are unprecedented federal funds available for water quality improvement projects. State leaders should be seizing this opportunity.

Fortunately, the State Senate and Assembly restored environmental funding in their own budget proposals, including $500 million for the Clean Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate budget proposal also included an additional $112 million for other water quality improvement projects. We are grateful to state legislators for their leadership and urge them to work with Hochul to ensure these investments are included in the final state budget.

New Yorkers should remember that clean water is the one thing we cannot live without and not something to take for granted. We Long Islanders know how essential clean water is to our lives; water surrounds and sustains our communities from our beloved coasts to the drinking water aquifer beneath our feet. We need to make sure our state leaders never forget how vital clean water is. We all need clean water, and we all depend on the infrastructure that provides it to us. Now is the time to update it.

We can build a more vibrant future for all New Yorkers when we invest in protecting clean water.",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,0.3568627450980393,448982684,1,https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MjlmZTY5ODEtYTYwYS00:NzE0YTMy/landscape/1280,spa-3424504

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

See our latest analysis for Equifax

As you can see below, Equifax had US$5.71b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$216.8m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$5.49b.

According to the last reported balance sheet, Equifax had liabilities of US$2.02b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$5.57b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$216.8m and US$949.1m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$6.43b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Since publicly traded Equifax shares are worth a very impressive total of US$32.8b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.

Equifax has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.0 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Investors should also be troubled by the fact that Equifax saw its EBIT drop by 11% over the last twelve months. If things keep going like that, handling the debt will about as easy as bundling an angry house cat into its travel box. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Equifax's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Equifax recorded free cash flow of 47% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.

While Equifax's net debt to EBITDA makes us cautious about it, its track record of (not) growing its EBIT is no better. At least its level of total liabilities gives us reason to be optimistic. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Equifax's debt poses some risks to the business. While that debt can boost returns, we think the company has enough leverage now. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. We've identified 1 warning sign with Equifax , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth).

Schiff, known for his critical views on cryptocurrency, argued that Saylor's aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin could be fraught with high risk and might lead to adverse outcomes for his company. Schiff's skepticism stems from the volatile nature of digital currencies and the potential for significant financial loss.

Saylor's aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin could be fraught with high risk due to several factors. Firstly, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets means that the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, which could lead to significant financial losses. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies could pose legal and operational risks.

Furthermore, the concentration of a large portion of assets in Bitcoin may not align with traditional investment diversification principles, potentially increasing financial vulnerability. It's crucial for investors to conduct thorough research and consider risk management strategies when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, is known for its high volatility. This characteristic can cause the value of Bitcoin to change dramatically in a very short period of time. Such unpredictability can significantly impact investors, potentially leading to substantial financial losses. It is crucial for individuals considering investing in Bitcoin to be aware of this risk and to have a strategy in place to mitigate potential losses.

Bitcoin's volatility is primarily due to its relatively small market size, which means that it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down. This is compounded by the fact that the cryptocurrency market is still very young and does not have the stability that comes with a mature market. Other factors contributing to Bitcoin's volatility include varying liquidity, differing perceptions of its intrinsic value, market sentiment, and news of significant events such as regulatory updates or technological breakthroughs.

Market sentiment plays a significant role in the volatility of Bitcoin. It refers to the overall attitude of investors towards a particular market or asset. In the case of Bitcoin, positive news or developments can lead to a surge in buying activity, driving up prices rapidly. Conversely, negative news can cause panic selling, leading to a sharp decline in prices. Since the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, it is particularly sensitive to changes in sentiment, which can be influenced by a wide range of factors including media coverage, investor behavior, and broader economic events.

Examples of positive news for Bitcoin that can affect market sentiment include announcements of large-scale institutional investments, countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, technological advancements in blockchain, and successful integration of Bitcoin into payment systems of major retailers. Additionally, favorable regulatory developments or endorsements from influential figures can also lead to increased investor confidence and a rise in Bitcoin's value.

When Bitcoin is adopted as legal tender, it means that it is recognized by a country's law as a valid form of payment for goods and services. It becomes an official currency alongside or instead of the traditional currency. This allows residents to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions such as buying groceries, paying bills, and taxes. The adoption also typically requires businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment, which can further integrate it into the economy and potentially stabilize its value over time.",tekedia.com,news,Tekedia,Paul Godwin,-0.192156862745098,448981736,1,https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/21140239/Michael-Saylor-Peter-Schiff-Bitcoin-BTC.jpg,eng-9417954

Campaigners have been pressing for years for a desperately-needed upgrade to the stretch of Leeds and Liverpool Canal towpath between Silsden and Kildwick.

Ruts, bumps and mud make the route a nightmare to negotiate.

Now an improvement scheme - including resurfacing, width increases, the cutting back of vegetation and installation of measures to prevent vehicular access - has been included in the Department for Transport's latest Active Travel Fund cash awards.

In total, £5.5m will be invested across West Yorkshire to improve walking and cycling routes.

The region's mayor, Tracy Brabin, says: ""This investment is a great vote of confidence in our region and will allow us to build on improvements already made.""

The towpath scheme is welcomed by Keighley MP Robbie Moore.

He says: ""Living in Silsden, I know just how important these upgrades are, and this is a project I've been pushing for since first being elected - alongside brilliant organisations like the Canal and River Trust.

""The Government's million pound funding announcement is fantastic news for all who like to get out and about and enjoy our fantastic Yorkshire countryside, helping to encourage more cycling and walking along our part of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal towpath and securing the route long into the future.

""The funds have been awarded by the Government to the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, which will oversee the improvement works - it's crucial it now gets on with it.""

The project is also welcomed by Keighley's Labour parliamentary candidate John Grogan, who backed the campaign for improvements during his time as MP between 2017-19.

He says: ""After years of campaigning by many different individuals and organisations, it is great that this section of towpath is to be upgraded at last for the benefit of walkers, cyclists and runners.

""It really has been an example of the wisdom of the old adages 'try, try and try again' and 'if at first you don't succeed'.

""I understand that the two outstanding issues associated with the project for some years have been the narrowness of the towpath and the quality of the material which will need to be used in the Silsden Conservation Area. Good old fashioned compromises on both have now been reached, allowing the green light to be given to the project.""",keighleynews.co.uk,news,Keighley News,,0.5450980392156863,448981163,1,https://www.keighleynews.co.uk/resources/images/17894936/,

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Water was surging from the drilling rig and flooding the test site as berms trapped it and directed the water toward lagoons once used by an abandoned missile launch complex nearby. Trucks sucked up the water with pumps and hauled it away to disposal wells as fast as they could.

The drill had hit pockets of carbon dioxide gas and more water than expected, according to state regulators and Anson Resources, the company behind the direct lithium extraction (DLE) project in which brine is pumped from deep aquifers to the surface, where lithium and other minerals are extracted from the water before it is sent back underground.

This process for acquiring lithium without as many environmental impacts as hard rock mining is gaining momentum, but uncertainty looms over how it will be done at scale in the U.S.

An incident like the blowout that occurred on March 8 is what locals like Dunham, a lifelong Green River resident, and environmentalists had been fearing. Green River gets its name from the waterway that runs through town, which is the biggest tributary of the Colorado River.

The company behind the project has said it would have no impact on local water supplies and the brine water from which they were seeking to extract lithium -- the soft, silvery metal that is critical to the batteries for electric vehicles and solar and wind farm energy storage projects -- would be returned to underground aquifers and not contaminate surface supplies. But here in early March, before any final permits for the project had been issued, was water rushing out of a drill site only a short distance from a wash that feeds into the river.

State agencies and Anson Resources said the water itself was not saline enough to have any potential impacts on humans and had not reached local washes or the river. But residents like Dunham worry about what happens when they begin to drill deeper.

The blowout had occurred at 1,500 feet underground; if permitted, the company plans to drill down up to 10,000 feet, and the water it pumps up will go from having 1,800 parts per million of chloride assay to over 300,000 ppm, levels highly toxic for human consumption -- fresh water has just 1,000 ppm. If that water were to reach the Green River, it could put Utah in violation of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, which regulates the levels of salts allowed in the river that supplies water for over 40 million people and irrigates millions of acres of farmland in the U.S. and Mexico.

The March 2024 blowout may not have caused any lasting harm, locals and environmentalists said, but what about the next one?

It's just one of the many questions concerned residents here have. Are the brine aquifers connected to the Green River? How will extracting the brine impact more shallow groundwater and surface water? What chemicals are used in the mining process? Could the process affect local ecosystems?

""I don't think the community really knows what's going on,"" Dunham said. ""Everybody really does just want jobs. Unfortunately, most people are just surviving. And when you're in survival mode, you really aren't as concerned about the environment.""

By drilling wells to pump up brine rather than digging huge holes into the ground to extract rock, the industry cites direct lithium extraction as a way to acquire the element critical to the energy transition without the environmental impacts of mining.

""Our process is efficient, we use less water than other manufacturing and lithium mining operations, we produce less carbon dioxide than hard rock mining,"" said Bruce Richardson, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Anson Resources, in a statement.

The process they use to remove minerals from brine would also produce less carbon dioxide than evaporation ponds, which draw lithium from brine by letting the water evaporate, he stated. ""We are utilizing existing structures and land usage areas smartly to reduce our footprint, and we are using a closed loop process so there is no risk of accidental spills,"" he said. ""Because the lithium we are extracting will go into electric vehicles, and the whole point of them is to have a lower impact on the environment, we're operating from that same point of view.""

""Unfortunately, most people are just surviving. And when you're in survival mode, you really aren't as concerned about the environment.""

But proving that it will be better for the environment -- in Green River and where other DLE projects are proposed from California to Arkansas -- is easier said than done. The technology has yet to be used at an operational scale in the U.S. and uncertainty exists over how the projects may impact fresh water supplies, a big issue in Utah and the Southwest, a region facing declining aquifers and decreasing flows on major rivers like the Colorado.

""We are not opposed to lithium,"" said Kyle Roerink, the executive director for the Great Basin Water Network, an organization focused on water issues in Nevada and Utah that is monitoring DLE proposals across Utah, including on the Great Salt Lake and in Green River. ""We are opposed to unsustainable and dangerous appropriations of water under the false assumptions that this new technology is absolutely harmless.""

Thousands of feet below eastern Utah, layers of rock have trapped seawater containing traces of lithium for more than 300 million years.

The process of extracting the mineral using DLE has existed for decades, and similar technology has been used to extract other minerals, though it is just being proposed as a less environmentally destructive alternative to mining for lithium.

Generally, DLE requires a well to extract brine water from which a chemical process extracts the lithium and other potentially desirable minerals via an ion exchange. But each operation is different, with variations in the chemicals required and how much freshwater is needed to extract the lithium, experts said.

""The notion that you see on websites for companies is 'Here comes the brine water and the magic chemical tweezers pull only this out and everything else goes back in the earth,"" said Corby Anderson, director of the Kroll Institute For Extractive Metallurgy at the Colorado School of Mines. ""This is not true. That's not how it works.""

Depending on the process, a DLE operation could see a net positive or net negative in its freshwater consumption, Anderson said, as some facilities may require more filtration of the minerals, pH adjustments, reverse osmosis and even evaporation processes.

That can lead to big fluctuations in how much fresh water various DLE operations consume, even if they use less brine water compared to other methods.

""DLE in theory would use or waste significantly a lot less water in total,"" said Daniel Saftner, a hydrogeologist at the Desert Research Institute who co-authored a report on how lithium mining could impact water supplies in Nevada. ""However, it's possible that DLE could use more freshwater.""

For its Green River project, Anson Resources has partnered with Sunresin, a Chinese-based ion exchange technology company.

According to Anson, natural pressure will send the brine water filled with lithium to a tank on the surface filled with an absorbent material that ""looks like instant coffee,"" which will extract the lithium over six hours. Then the spent brine water is sent back into the ground, making the process a ""nonconsumptive use."" Fresh water from the Green River is used to flush the tank and that lithium-filled water is pumped to a closed system that removes the metal ions. An evaporator then recycles the Green River water for use in the next batch.

Anson has acquired 2,500 acre-feet of Green River water from various entities for the process. The company claims it plans to recycle at least 90 percent of the water used during the operation and that only 10 percent of its water rights will be used a year. It is also seeking a permit allowing it to use 13,000 acre feet of the brine water under a nonconsumptive use application for the Green River project.

With no DLE mines in operation in the U.S., however, it remains difficult to gauge how they might impact local environments and water supplies. ""The environmental impacts are still unknown and will likely vary by location,"" Saftner said.

The Desert Research Institute's report on lithium mining's potential impacts on hydrology, which Saftner helped co-author, identified DLE as likely the most environmentally friendly option in most cases. That's because, in an ideal scenario, a DLE operation can be integrated into existing infrastructure, such as at a geothermal power plant or a groundwater pumping facility, and typically doesn't require land-intensive evaporation ponds, which are used in another method of extracting lithium from brine water.

However, if a DLE site is being proposed and requires new infrastructure, it becomes murkier over whether it's better than other existing methods.

New DLE projects also provide the option for acquiring other resources. Anson plans to extract bromine from the Green River project and says it could potentially generate hydropower from the pressure the brine water produces when being sent to the surface.

Making the economics work for DLE projects will be key, said Jeremy Pearson, the director of the San Rafael Energy Research Center, who has closely been following the proposals in Utah. To him, DLE could be used to extract a valuable mineral, and rather than send the spent brine back into the earth, desalinating it so it could bolster water supplies in the drought-stricken Southwest.

""The economics have to work,"" he said. ""But if you get those economics to work, I see that as the future.""

Economics mean nothing, however, if a community won't buy into a project.

Sometimes development needs to be delayed so companies can build trust in communities, Pearson said. ""But what good is the development if everyone's living in fear?"" he asked.

A lack of trust and clarity over what the potential impacts could be is driving much of the concern over the Green River project.

""This community is basically an experimental community"" for testing DLE at scale, said John Weisheit, conservation director of Living Rivers-Colorado Riverkeeper, at a public meeting for the project in late February. Questions over the risk for well failures and how the chemicals used in the process would be disposed of had not been answered, he said, and regulators were allowing a ""very big project in the wrong place.""

""Decision makers are making serious missteps that could lead to future litigation,"" Weisheit said.

The state's declaration of limited water supplies in the region is the basis for some of the environmental groups' concerns. ""The water resources of this area are considered to be limited,"" reads a web page for the area's surface- and groundwater supplies. ""New appropriations are limited to small amounts of beneficial use sufficient to serve the domestic requirements of one family, the irrigation of one acre, and ten head of livestock."" But nonconsumptive uses of water are ""considered on the individual merits of each application,"" which would apply to the DLE project.

Utah's water laws, however, did not foresee projects like this one, said Roerink with the Great Basin Water Network, and the verdict is still out on whether the use of the brine water will be consumptive or not. Roerink added that laws were just passed in the current legislative session requiring state agencies to develop rules for brine mining operations dealing with safety, the development of multiple minerals at a site and the spacing of wells, opening the door for potentially more DLE operations in the state.

Brine water is too saline for drinking or use in agriculture or industrial settings. But brine aquifers can be interconnected with other water supplies that people can use, so the consumption of brine water can trickle up to impact the water rights of other entities.

State regulators and Anson say the brine aquifers the company will use for DLE aren't connected to other sources of water, but environmentalists and federal agencies have questioned that claim.

And though many DLE projects plan to reinject the brine back into aquifers once the lithium is extracted, the chemical composition may have changed to alter lithium concentrations in the deep aquifers it returns to or, if it's sent into a more shallow groundwater reservoir, impact connected aquatic ecosystems.

""Introducing foreign water to an aquifer is going to change its water quality,"" Saftner said, which could have a ""potential ripple effect"" if those aquifers are connected to wetlands or feed local surface waters.

Anson plans to reinject the spent brine into a higher aquifer to not dilute the lithium they plan to extract. A spokesperson for the company did not answer how that new source of water could impact the aquifer it is sent to.

Concerns over DLE's impact on water and the environment are not unique to Green River, with projects around the country encountering concerns over their potential environmental impacts and skepticism over how the technology works.

Oil giant Exxon Mobil announced late last year it would be drilling for lithium in a southern Arkansas town where the fossil fuel industry once employed most of the residents, citing the ability to use oil and gas drilling methods. Multiple companies have proposed DLE operations on the Great Salt Lake, prompting concern over taking more water out of a lake that in recent years has verged on the edge of collapse.

At the Salton Sea in Southern California, geothermal plants, which use hot brine to create energy, propose to extract the lithium from the water using DLE, allowing facilities to both create energy and source the mineral needed to store it. The Imperial Valley, home of the Salton Sea, has enough lithium by itself to satisfy the nation's needs, a recent study found. However, locals and environmental groups have raised concerns over the amount of Colorado River water needed to make the operations work and how DLE projects may impact communities that already face health impacts from the region's poor air quality stemming from the degradation of the sea.

The Imperial Valley Irrigation District -- which uses the largest share of the Colorado River's water -- has 25,000 acre feet earmarked for industrial purposes, like mining. There's enough water available for ""Hell's Kitchen,"" one of the projects closest to being constructed, but not enough for others, said Jared Naimark, a mining organizer in California for Earthworks who has worked with local communities in Imperial Valley regarding lithium projects.

That means if more are to be built, they'll need to acquire water from local farms. If less water goes to agriculture, the Salton Sea, which receives most of its water from agricultural drainage, could have its supply diminished. That's an issue because as the Salton Sea shrinks, it exposes the lake bed -- filled with toxic chemicals from years of drainage from local farms -- to worsen the region's air quality and degrade the health of the local population.

""In these cases, where you have extreme drought and limited Colorado River supply, and all of the complex trade-offs involved in that, that needs to be a part of that analysis"" for these projects, Neimark said. ""The fact that this is potentially better than some other form of extraction shouldn't be an excuse to get around or reverse environmental review.""

Those concerns were not addressed in the environmental impact statement completed for the project, community and environmental groups said, resulting in a petition filed March 14 against the county, alleging that the approval of the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act and failed to properly consult local tribes as required under the law.

As climate change and overconsumption sip away at the region's water supplies, any project involving water, including for mining, will be fiercely debated. Across the Southwest, it's a dispute that's been raging for years, as mines for minerals needed for the renewable energy transition could potentially impact local water quantity and quality and comes as states reckon with declining aquifers and engage in tense debates over large cutbacks on the Colorado River.

Green River water -- which feeds the Colorado -- grew the small community where Anson is planning its DLE mine. Large farms surround the town. It has a museum dedicated to the river and John Wesley Powell, the Civil War officer who famously first floated and mapped it. Its Melon Days Festival celebrates the area's famous cantaloupes, honeydews, canaries and watermelons. Many of its residents are eager for new jobs and support the energy transition, but only after ensuring the water that's been vital to the town's history and economy won't suffer in the process.",insideclimatenews.org,news,InsideClimate News,Derek Harrison,-0.2156862745098039,448979969,1,https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Green-River-1_Courtesy-1024x683.jpg,

There is no current Support Plan to trigger a buy of this stock at this time. This usually means that there are no clear support levels at this time, so buying the stock as it falls could be considered catching a falling knife. Buy signals only exist if resistance breaks higher.

This often is a signal that the stock you are watching is weak. Waiting for a turn higher may be more intelligent than trying to catch a falling knife. In any case, new support levels are usually revised to the database at the beginning of the next trading session.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of MPAA as it gets near 8.27, but the downside target is not available from the current data. This tells us to hold that position if it is triggered until a new downside target has been established (updates occur at the beginning of every trading session) or until the position has been stopped. The summary data tells us to have a stop loss in place at 8.29. 8.27 is the first level of resistance above 7.84, and by rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance 8.27 is being tested, so a short signal would exist.

If 8.27 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy MPAA just slightly over 8.27, with an upside target of 9.67. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 8.25 in case the stock turns against the trade. 8.27 is the first level of resistance above 7.84, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 8.27, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of MPAA if it tests 8.27 with a downside target of 7.76. We should have a stop loss in place at 8.29 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 8.27, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

City commissioners recently approved the company's request to extend a previous payment-in-lieu-of-taxes deal to 50 years. That'll allow the company behind Annika Place to apply to Michigan State Housing Development Authority for a loan to build 52 more one- and two-bedroom apartments next door. Out of those, 19 will be set aside as permanent supportive housing for people who need it, including those in chronic homelessness.

It's the second time in as many years the company asked for, and got, a tax break from the city for what it's calling Annika Place II. Patterson told commissioners MSHDA previously rejected the company's request for Low Income Housing Tax Credits the agency awards on a competitive basis to a limited number of projects each year.

So the company is trying a noncompetitive route, Patterson said. They're still Low Income Housing Tax Credits, but they offer investors a smaller tax break than competitively awarded ones. Projects that use noncompetitive credits need money to fill a large financing gap since they bring in only 44 percent of investor equity compared to competitively awarded ones.

Enter Goodwill of Northern Michigan, which will put up $400,000 in money from Grand Traverse County's American Rescue Plan Act funds, Patterson said Friday.

That, plus a trio of mortgages from MSDHA, should be enough financing, including money specifically for filling financing gaps in permanent supportive housing projects -- another ARPA-funded program.

""That came at a critical time, because there was a big gap that MSHDA was wondering if they had enough money and loans to help us, and that $400,000 helped us to get closer,"" Patterson said.

Dan Buron, with the nonprofit, said county leaders agreed to reallocate the funding so the developer can complete the project. Project-based vouchers will help tenants in the 19 permanent supportive units to make the rent.

""That is a rare thing to have, and it's very important for this community and for our efforts to end chronic homelessness,"" Buron told commissioners.

The project offers a glimpse into the complex world of financing affordable housing. Projects require funding ""stacks"" from investors, housing agencies and more to be built, property tax breaks to secure that funding and, in many cases, rent subsidies for tenants.

Both phases of Annika Place have project-based vouchers for permanent supportive housing, Patterson said. The Traverse City Housing Commission administers these vouchers, which are attached to a particular housing unit. These vouchers are ultimately funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and allow tenants to pay 30 percent of their month's income for rent, whatever that might be.

While MSHDA generally funds vouchers for permanent supportive housing, Traverse City Housing Commission agreed to put up its project-based vouchers from HUD for Annika Place, Patterson said.

Tenants who aren't applying for permanent supportive housing must earn between 30 and 80 percent of area median income, Patterson said -- between $26,970 and $71,920 for a family of four, according to MSHDA.

Those tenants can also use Housing Choice Vouchers, but it's not required, Patterson said. It's another form of subsidy that lets renters make income-based rent payments, and which they can bring with them wherever they're accepted. These are funded through HUD and administered locally through Traverse City Housing Commission and, in Bellaire, Tip of the Mitt Housing.

Patterson said he's hoping he'll know if MSDHA will approve loans for Annika Place II within a few weeks. The developer wants to start construction at 1020 Hastings Street, west of Garfield Avenue and Annika Place, in the summer.

""We've talked to MSDHA about our timeline, and winter is coming,"" he said, laughing as the snow fell on Friday.

If approved and constructed, the company would pay 6 percent of net shelter rents to Traverse City instead of property taxes, city Attorney Lauren Trible-Laucht said.

That's the cost of rents paid, minus that of certain utilities. Patterson said the 50-year term aligns with the length of the MSHDA loans, and the developer must keep the entire building as affordable housing for the length of that mortgage.

The city previously granted a 16-year PILOT, likely to be renewed since financing would have required affordable housing over 45 years.

Meanwhile, construction continues at the first phase of Annika Place. Patterson showed city commissioners a video demonstrating the panelized building methods that can cut up to six weeks off build times. By sourcing these panels from an offsite factory, contractors can simultaneously lay the foundations while the factory starts making panels.

That also saves the company money, since for Annika Place II the company has to comply with prevailing wage laws for onsite construction work, Patterson said.

Annika Place should be ready for its first tenants in April, with all 53 units already leased, Patterson said.

The company also has a 260-applicant waitlist, and they'll get a shot at an apartment in the second phase.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo! Finance,,0.2392156862745098,448979929,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

The technical summary data tells us to buy MOTO near 43.26, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 43.14 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 43.26 is the first level of support below 43.7087, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 43.26 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy MOTO just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 43.7087, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of MOTO if it tests n/a with a downside target of 43.6. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 44.03 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy MOTO just slightly over 44.03, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 43.93 in case the stock turns against the trade. 44.03 is the first level of resistance above 43.7087, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 44.03, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of MOTO if it tests 44.03 with a downside target of 43.6. We should have a stop loss in place at 44.13 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 44.03, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

Raising funds marks a pivotal milestone for any startup venturing towards success. Today, Indian startups boast a plethora of funding options, from bootstrapping to early-stage investments by venture capital firms. Among these options, venture debt has emerged as an enticing choice for startups aiming to foster growth while retaining control and limiting dilution.

Venture debt offers startups the ability to borrow capital, unlike equity financing, which involves relinquishing ownership stakes. This allows startups to fuel growth without significant ownership dilution.

In the dynamic landscape of the Indian startup ecosystem, venture debt presents an appealing option to bridge funding gaps amidst global economic downturns, high valuations, and market volatility.

Recent statistics indicate a growing traction towards venture debt, with Indian startups raising a substantial amount through debt funding, reflecting its increasing popularity compared to previous years.

As per Inc42's H1 2023 Startup Funding Report, between January and June 2023, Indian startups raised $260.7 Mn in debt funding, accounting for almost 4.81% of the $5.4 Bn total funds raised. This shows an increasing traction for venture debt compared to only 1.48% in the second half of 2022.

As Indian startups navigate these challenges, striking a balance between venture debt and equity becomes paramount. Understanding the nuances and trade-offs involved in choosing between debt and equity financing empowers founders to make informed decisions aligned with their growth trajectory.

Venture debt has emerged as an innovative funding avenue for Indian startups, allowing them to fuel growth while enjoying several benefits. The primary advantage of venture debt is that it avoids significant dilution of the founder's stakes. Startups dilute little to no ownership when raising debt.

Further, venture debt often comes with lighter stipulations around governance and decision-making compared to venture capital. Startups can thus safeguard their independence even as they raise growth capital.

Another added advantage is that venture debt has faster turnaround times - loan decisions can materialise within a few weeks, whereas VC deals take months. The repayment burden is also more flexible as compared to traditional bank loans, with options of interest-only payments for initial years and ballooning repayment timelines timed with projected cash flows.

These founder-friendly options enable startups to conserve cash flows for scaling up. Many venture debt firms also offer equity kickers or warrants which deliver outsized returns if startups achieve growth milestones. For high-growth startups, venture debt ensures investors enjoy fixed income-like yields with uncapped upside potential.

However, venture debt may not suit capital-intensive startups with uncertain, long-gestation business models. The finite repayment timelines and amortisation schedules require disciplined financial planning and cash flow management.

Equity financing, though more cumbersome, offers longer fundraising cycles and flexibility around capital deployment. While dilution is an emotional burden, visionary founders recognise that marquee VCs often overcompensate for this by opening up invaluable networks, ecosystems and operational expertise.

The choice between venture debt and equity is thus complex, requiring clarity around business models and growth expectations. Broadly, venture debt suits startups with surer visibility into near-term cash generation, while equity is ideal for highly scalable, capital-intensive models though dilution and diminished control are risks to be managed.

Equity investors have focused their attention on high-growth startups, particularly in sectors like ecommerce, fintech, and software. Many look for proven business models before investing, preferring more stable startups that need capital to scale up operations.

Venture debt has become more popular as well, often being used to complement equity funding. Debt investors like the ability to lend against assets and recurring revenues rather than betting completely on future potential.

Preferences differ significantly across industries. Real estate and infrastructure projects often utilise 80% debt due to the collateral provided by physical assets. Startups tend to use far less debt, with over 75% of their capital coming from equity shares.

This highlights that the majority of startup funding is through equity financing. Overall, founders should think carefully about their capital structure. Venture debt can provide working capital and extend cash runways without diluting ownership.

The two sources also have different risk-return profiles. Blending debt and equity can optimise the capital stack for a company's specific situation. Understanding these dynamics allows entrepreneurs to strategically tap the growing pool of investment capital available in India.

The choice between venture debt and equity financing depends on the specific requirements and situations of individual startups. Debt and equity are not opposing forces but rather complementary components of a company's capital structure.

While debt provides leverage and tax benefits, equity offers flexibility and risk-sharing. Balancing both optimally ensures sustainable growth and financial stability.

For founders, it is important to align funding options with their risk appetite, desire for control, and capital needs across business life cycles. For investors, their funding preferences and return expectations play a key role.",inc42.com,news,Inc42 Media,,0.003921568627450966,448979716,1,https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-45.png,

The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.

""We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.

AI runs on data

Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:

AI is everywhere and machine learning and AI growth has just exploded. There's lots of theories, lots of views on how AI will manifest itself, how it'll be deployed. But the one thing, the one plain truth is the only way AI can be delivered is through physical data infrastructure on the ground. And what that means is data centers and lots of them.

AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.

The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.

Building a leading data center platform

Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.

The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:

Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.

On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.

A high-powered growth driver

Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.

The first $1.9 million in superannuation (i.e. up to the pension cap) upon retirement is highly tax effective, and the balance between $1.9 million and $3 million is very tax effective, but balances above $3 million may become questionable should the government's policy, mooted to begin on July 1, 2025, be passed.

Investment companies pay tax at 30 per cent, whereas people earning over $135,000 will now stay in the 37 per cent (plus Medicare levy) marginal tax bracket for their personal taxable income between $135,000 and $190,000, creating an incentive to utilise an investment company to tax-effectively manage their family's investment activities.

There are a number of other benefits of companies such as asset protection advantages and estate planning flexibility.

Because companies are perpetual, they live on when the key people die. Shares (ownership) can be transferred according to the deceased shareholder's wishes and daily control (via directors) can be replaced.

Further, companies offer a flexible structure in terms of types of shares issued and rights thereon. Lending money to a company for it to invest is simple, as is reinvesting of future profits.

Superannuation, by contrast, has contribution limits, and restrictions in relation to loans, accessibility, regulation of allowable investments, and audit obligations.

A superannuation account must be wound up upon death and at that point a ""death benefit"" tax of 15 per cent is payable on the taxable component of a payment made to non-dependant beneficiaries.

Investment companies can also be preferable to a family discretionary trust.

A company pays tax on its income each year but doesn't have to distribute its income - that is, it doesn't have to pay a dividend. A family trust doesn't pay tax itself, but does have to distribute its taxable income to beneficiaries who then pay the tax at their marginal tax rate, which can be as high as 47 per cent for individuals, or 30 per cent for company beneficiaries.

While income distributed can be loaned back to the trust, the Australian Tax Office has determined (per section 100A anti-avoidance rules) that beneficiaries who are entitled to a distribution cannot simply reimburse it to the benefit of someone else.

Practically speaking, a family trust can't declare a distribution to an adult child and have them reallocate it to the loan account of the parent.

An investment company can, however, declare a dividend to a shareholder, including a family member on a relatively low marginal tax rate, with the shareholder loaning the funds back interest-free to the company. The cash need never leave the company.

Unlike the section 100A rules for trusts, there are no such rules for private investment companies and their shareholders.

Like companies, trusts can live on past the death of key individuals, but they are usually not perpetual. Most have a vesting date of 80 years after formation.

One area where family trusts have an advantage is when it comes to capital gains. Capital gains earned by a company are liable to the company tax rate of 30 per cent.

Trust distributions, however, may be entitled to the 50 per cent reduction applying to assets held for more than 12 months.

This reduction is only available to individual beneficiaries, not companies.

Each of the entities discussed - companies, superannuation funds, and family discretionary trusts - have various pros and cons.

One thing for certain is that it is not ""one size fits all"", and often the best result can be gained from a combination of approaches.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.3019607843137255,448979409,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1293%2C$multiply_4%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/c6855ee376430de083f99f9bdfaf73fabd39f6d6,

Banga, speaking at the China Development Forum early on Sunday, China time, said the World Bank Group had mobilised $41bn of private capital for emerging markets and raised another $42bn from the private sector for bond issuance last year, with both totals to be eclipsed this year.

But he said more progress was needed, and the bank was taking action on a number of fronts to overcome barriers holding back private sector investment in developing economies.

Economic growth has slowed in developing countries, with growth falling to barely 4% from 6% in two decades, Banga said, noting that each lost percentage point dragged 100-million people into poverty, while debt levels were rising.

Banga noted that developing countries also faced an ""unimaginable"" gap between 1.1-billion young people expected to enter the workforce in the next decade and expected job creation of just 325-million jobs.

To better understand the issues, the bank convened a focus group with the CEOs of 15 asset management companies, banks and operators who identified concerns such as regulatory certainty, political risk insurance and foreign exchange risk, he said.

The bank last month already announced reforms that will consolidate its loan and investment guarantee structure and triple its annual guarantees to $20bn by 2030.

Starting next week, Banga said, the bank and a consortium of development institutions would also start publishing private sector recovery data by county income level, as a step to inspire investor confidence.

The World Bank would also publish private sector default data broken down by credit rating, as well as sovereign default and recovery rate statistics dating back to 1985, he said.

""All this work contributes to one goal: getting more private sector capital into developing economies to drive impact and create jobs,"" Banga said.

The former Mastercard CEO said the bank was also working on a longer-term effort to build a securitisation platform that would make it easier for pension funds and other institutional investors to bring their $70-trillion to emerging markets.

Bundling large standardised investments into one package would encourage meaningful investment at scale, overcoming the current patchwork of small, bespoke loans that each had their own documents, risk and pricing, he said.

China's ""remarkable journey"" in the past five decades was a testament to what is possible, Banga said, noting China had created hundreds of millions of jobs, sharply reduced poverty and cut emissions.

The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.

""We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.

Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:

AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.

The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.

Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.

The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:

Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.

On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.

Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.

This has been done in harnessing His Majesty King Mswati III's dream of transforming Eswatini into a first world country.

The exponentially expanding coal mine, nestled near the village of Maloma, now boast of, among others, an additional shaft that was officially opened by His Majesty on Friday, and comes with an improved life span of 20 years from just a previous mere three years.

The mine that has broken barriers in empowering women and now boasts a first female Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the male dominated sector, Jabulile Shabangu, has also doubled its staff in just 36 months from 500 in 2021 to over 1 000 in 2024 as a means of playing a part in being a major employer in the region.

The increased staff members include those of contractors that are part of the production chain.

Under the leadership of Chairman Michelo Shakantu, the mine has through continual upgrades and investments, embraced modernisation to meet world class standards.

Shakantu, in partly giving a breakdown of the massive E700 million investment, disclosed that the mine had channelled E200 million in upgrading its processing plant to be more efficient by improving its capacity to now process about double what it used to and also recycle water.

""We have further invested E250 million into shaft one and E150 million into shaft three. All this has been to improve the mine, ensuring operational efficiency and sustainability for years to come.

""We have further paid over E350 million to government in dividends, royalties and other taxes to resonate with our goal of improving the country's economy and creating a better Eswatini,"" he highlighted.

It does not end there as Shakantu also revealed that the company had now diversified its exports into becoming one of the leading FOREX (foreign exchange) earners.

Product

""Other than exporting our product to South Africa, we have now reached out to markets in the Vietnam, Poland and Finland. The sky is just the limit as we try to maximise on reaching the global markets,"" added the chairman.

Through strategic investments and operational improvements, the astute businessman further noted that Maloma had significantly improved its production capacity and efficiency.

Maloma mines the highest and finest grade of coal anthracite which is highly sought after worldwide for its superior quality in the metallurgical industries.

Maloma's anthracite is widely used in the production of chrome and stainless steel products around the world.

Having started operation in 1992, Maloma Colliery had been a cornerstone of Eswatini's mining sector and with proven reserves of 19 million saleable tonnes and a strategic location just 50 kilometres from the South African border, the mine has been a key contributor to the country's economy.

Shakantu highlighted that the upgraded first-world processing plant emphasises the importance of leveraging technology and innovation to drive economic growth.

With a renewed emphasis on job creation, he noted that the plant seeks to recruit and train local talent, empowering communities and fostering economic resilience.

The plant, established near the village of Maloma, is the result of a joint-venture between two Danish companies, Giersing Rose and Superfos Dammon Luxol, forming the Carbonex partnership.",new.observer.org.sz,news,new.observer.org.sz,,0.1843137254901961,448978172,1,,

The Stamp Act Congress met on Oct. 22, 1765, to protest British taxation without representation. It was a key factor in our country's fight for freedom.

On Feb. 29, 2024, the Utah Legislature voted to approve the amended HB488. The ""bill amends provisions related to certain local option sales and use taxes to allow revenue to be used for public safety purposes, and to remove the requirement for the imposition to be subject to an opinion question for the relevant registered voters in certain circumstances""(Lines 15-17).

Why would the Legislature vote for taxation without representation? What transit oriented project would rise to the level of our elected leaders fearing the voice of the people? There is only one I can think of -- the gondola.

Carefully crafted, HB488 authorizes the raising of millions of dollars for transit funding for a list of options that could be almost anything. But why would they require the removal of voter approval? It was obvious from the record number of emails that UDOT received against the gondola that the public was not in favor of the project. Putting one and one together I can only come up with one reason: yes, the funding of the gondola.

Fellow citizens, rise up, contact your representatives, remind them of the history that created our country. Tell them that taxation without representation will not be allowed in our state. Tell them that in the next legislative session they must repeal HB488. Their reelection hangs in the balance.

The White House announced the signing on Saturday (Mar 23) after the US Senate approved the package in the early morning hours. That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the US-Mexico border.

""I want to be clear: Congress' work isn't finished,"" Biden said in a statement on Saturday.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's top civilian official said last week that Ukraine is ""running out of ammunition"", echoing warnings by the country's allies, including the US.

The funding package increases defence appropriations by 3 per cent while keeping overall domestic spending flat. Temporary spending measures had funded the federal government for the first six months of the federal fiscal year.

Though the Senate session dragged past midnight, the White House said it was ending preparations for a shutdown. Federal agencies weren't affected by the short lapse because ""obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis"", it said in a statement.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said as he announced a deal to end a Republican filibuster, clearing the way for the bill to pass the Senate on a 74-24 vote.

No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.

But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.

Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.

Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.

Slow and steady wins the race

Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.

Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.

But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.

While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.

Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.

Keep an eye out for more details

Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.

Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.

This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.

However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.

Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.

If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.

No, the Oracle of Omaha didn't pour into the iPhone maker over hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Buffett has owned Apple since 2016, long before the AI narrative was taking shape.

But during the past year, many of Apple's big tech cohorts, such as Microsoft and Alphabet, have been making notable strides in AI. While the Windows developer and internet search giant made several public announcements about their AI ambitions, Apple remained quiet.

Playing coy is pretty standard for Apple -- but this time, it felt a little different. With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report.

Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock.

Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. Since the investment, Microsoft has quickly integrated ChatGPT across its Windows operating system -- specifically, in applications related to Microsoft Office and the company's Azure cloud platform.

Alphabet and Amazon swiftly followed Microsoft's move, with each company making splashy investments in an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft.

But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution, remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.

While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store. Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing.

Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone.

Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls.

Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion. What I mean by that is a partnership could be a way for Apple to stay in the conversation while the company figures out its actual strategy.

This is why I see an investment in Apple right now as potentially a generational move. It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story.

However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500. I don't understand why an investor would pay a premium over the broader market and other established AI players -- especially for a company that isn't growing and doesn't appear to have a concrete plan.

Given Apple's long-term success, however, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt -- for now. While I'm wary of buying the stock at its current valuation, I'm equally curious to learn more about any potential relationship with rival platforms. A prudent strategy is to keep a keen eye out for any further details surrounding Apple's AI roadmap and assess the stock's volatility after any news.

If your conviction rises on any developments out of Apple as it relates to AI, it could be worth scooping up shares and holding for the long term.

The IMF recently proposed that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) impose a uniform excise duty on all locally manufactured cigarettes, irrespective of the manufacturer's origin, to generate additional revenue.

However, tax revenue from the tobacco sector predominantly originates from just two legal companies, as the FBR has completely failed to bring the illicit cigarette manufacturers into the tax net, as per The Express TribuneWith the potential to enhance annual revenue from the tobacco industry to Rs600 billion, up from the current Rs250 billion, cracking down on the illicit tobacco trade is seen as a crucial step. This move aligns with the government's ambition to elevate the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20% and address Pakistan's economic challenges more effectively.

""Curbing the illicit tobacco trade is not just about revenue; it is also about meeting IMF conditions and strengthening Pakistan's economic resilience. This initiative can significantly contribute to enhancing tax collection and improving the tax-to-GDP ratio,"" said Osama Siddiqui, a microeconomic analyst.

According to The Express Tribune, recent industry data reveals a surge in the market share of illicit cigarettes, now standing at 63 per cent, emphasising the pressing need for intervention. The widening gap, attributed to the higher prices of legal cigarettes, has propelled consumers towards more affordable, untaxed alternatives, leading to a staggering loss of Pakistani currency (PKR) 310 billion in tax revenue.

He added that addressing the illicit tobacco trade was not just a fiscal necessity but also a strategic move to fund infrastructure development, healthcare and education.

It has a pipeline of more than 50 active projects and expansions to drive growth, which is expected to generate incremental revenue of over USD 6 billion and boost EBITDA from an expected USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 6 billion in the next and up to USD 7.5 billion by FY27, they added.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, according to a presentation made at the investor meeting, said the company ""will get to a different level in the next 25 years"".

His brother and vice chairman Naveen Agarwal gave details of the plans.

""Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5+ billion yearly EBITDA,"" he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ""incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion"".

""We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of USD 7.5 billion annually,"" he said.

Some of the significant projects due for immediate commissioning include a refinery expansion at the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, expansion at BALCO to 1 million tonnes, commissioning of the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to almost double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, capacity expansion at Gamsberg Zinc facility to take Zinc International capacity to 5,00,000 tonnes from 2,73,000 tonnes now, raising iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and becoming India's largest ferro-alloys producer with a 5,00,000 tonnes per annum capacity.

""40+ ongoing growth projects with a plan to spend USD 6 billion in capex"" will help boost EBITDA from an estimated USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 7.5 billion in FY26 (April 2025 to March 2025),"" Vedanta said in the presentations.

Stating that deleveraging was its ""utmost priority"", it said a USD 3 billion deleveraging over the next three years has been firmed up at parent Vedanta Resources without an increase in debt levels at the India-listed firm.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to USD 9 billion by FY27 from USD 13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by USD 3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to USD 6 billion and has ""reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around USD 4 billion"".

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation.""

Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin.

The proposed demerger of businesses is a ""significant value unlocking for our shareholders,"" it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every 1 share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Vedanta Base Metal, said Zinc International is targeting a 1 million tonne production pipeline by 2030 from the current 2,20,000 tonnes through expansions at Black Mountain and Gamsberg mines in South Africa.

Copper India is targeting to create a 1 million tonne capacity for copper and gold production per annum by 2030 from the current 2,60,000 tonnes through debottlenecking the Silvassa refinery, units in UAE and Saudi Arabia and restarting the Tuticorin unit.

Vibhav Agarwal, CEO of the power business of the company, at the investor meeting, said the group has a portfolio of 4,780 megawatt of electricity generation capacity, which will by FY27 (April 2026 to March 2027) generate INR 15,000 crore of revenue and INR 3,500 crore of EBITDA annually compared to INR 6,910 crore revenue and INR 1,050 crore EBITDA in the current fiscal.",auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,ETAuto.com,,0.192156862745098,448976101,1,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-108750548,imgsize-9728,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etauto/industry/vedanta-touts-usd-6-bn-investment-pipeline-as-growth-driver.jpg",

He called on the federal government to incentivise states to reform tax and planning settings and conduct a review into Australia's competitiveness.

""Fundamentally, we need to concentrate on making Australia a more competitive place within which to do business,"" he said.

Dr Chalmers last week told a BCA dinner that the IGR's predictions were ""not pre-ordained"" and he was heartened the issue was a key focus of The Australian Financial Review Business Summit earlier this month.

""We have agency and we have choices. We don't decide the conditions but we can shape them if we are smart,"" he said.

At the dinner at Parliament House in Canberra, held under the Chatham House rule, the treasurer told business leaders that how Australia ""attracts, absorbs and deploys investment"" would be a ""big question"" for the federal budget in May.

""The common ingredient in our success - the thing that binds all of this up together - is investment,"" he said. ""I saw investment was the focus of the BCA's public commentary last week and I welcome that, and I share it.""

He said it was the policy area he was spending the most time on.

""We are working out how to bring together our plans for a future made in Australia, our prospects in critical minerals, and our co-investment agenda into one piece of work to boost investment in our economy,"" he said.

Pushing back against criticism from unions and other quarters that workers were losing out on wages growth because businesses had failed to make investments that would improve productivity, Mr Black said ultimately capital was highly liquid and would be allocated based on the best returns.

Citing the shift to Australia being a net exporter of capital, including to the United States, where former president Donald Trump in 2019 slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent, Mr Black said Australia needed to do more.

""I could not begin to tell you how often I hear from CEOs the common point that they're not quite sure if they have got free cash that Australia is the right place for them to invest,"" he said.

""They can go to another jurisdiction and that jurisdiction will offer tax incentives or a better planning process or a concierge system through government so that all the twists and turns can be negotiated more readily.""

The issue is particularly relevant for business leaders with overseas boards that made decisions about global investment allocation.

""Frequently, I hear this point made that international boards are making the call to invest elsewhere rather than Australia,"" Mr Black said. ""So, yes, it is correct we need to see business investment to drive productivity here in Australia, but to attract that investment, we need to be competitive.""

Among the BCA's proposals is getting the Albanese government to offer billions of dollars in incentives to states and territories to abolish regressive stamp duties, make payroll taxes uniform across the country, and reduce the time it takes for developments to get planning approval.

With Australia's global competitiveness rankings plummeting in recent years, Mr Black also wants the Albanese government to launch a review into how to make the nation more competitive to investment, similar to the one conducted last year in the United Kingdom by Lord Richard Harrington.

""You have to look at the process of trying to win investment through the type of prism that a company CEO would look through to try and drive productivity improvements within their own organisation,"" he said.

""That means you start with targets: what is it we're trying to achieve? You put in place plans to deliver on each target, and then you fundamentally structure your government processes around the delivery of those plans.""

The government will on Thursday make its submission to the Fair Work Commission's wage case, which will determine pay rises for at least 2.4 million workers on the national minimum wage and award wages.

The submission will again argue that ""the real wages of Australia's low-paid workers do not go backwards,"" according to the latest draft, while also noting any increase should be ""in addition"" to the stage three tax cuts set to commence on July 1, not a substitute for them.

An increase of about 3.7 per cent - halfway between 4.1 per cent achieved in December and 3.3 per cent forecast by the RBA by June 30 - would mean the minimum wage would have increased by about 18 per cent over three years after rises of 8.6 per cent in 2023 and 5.2 per cent in 2022.

It is unclear how many workers are covered by the national minimum wage, which last year increased from $21.38 to $23.23 an hour, or from $812.60 to $882.80 a week, putting them towards the top of the OECD's ranking of real minimum wages among its members.

The government will argue that while inflation has moderated and overall real wages have begun to grow, price rises remain elevated and above the RBA's 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band which hurt low-income families the most necessitating another inflation-linked increase from July 1.

The submission tempers any suggestion of a similarly sized increase more broadly in the economy.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.2156862745098038,448975851,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2116%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_167/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/ccd242902ce768fde1f9569ce4d6c86465832a4b,

The app is currently in private beta mode.

Social platform Qoohoo that allows creators to build engaging communities has raised seed funding of $800,000 from a consortium of investors. Co-founder Vimal Singh Rathore shared the funding announcement on a Twitterthread on Tuesday.

According to the founders, a large part of the funding will be utilised to build its engineering and product team.

Vimal and Aseem Gupta started Qoohoo in 2020 with an aim to empower creators to launch their communities swiftly with immersive engagement and fast content creation.

""The journey started by recognising a big problem back in March 2020 when my brother's entire music academy shifted online and the series of problems and possibilities it brought in,"" says Vimal.

The app is currently in private beta mode (Android and iOS).

""Art and creation denote freedom,"" said Vimal. ""I wanted to follow an unstructured approach for engagement between the creator and their audience, and eventually easy monetisation for the creators.

Vimal had earlier founded edtech startup Coursavy in 2019. In just 18 months of launch, Coursavy claimed to have registered more than 70,000 students, with more than 70 percent of daily targets and course completion rates.

After bootstrapping successfully and profitably, Coursavy got acquired by Unacademy in September 2020 to scale the model of engagement, learning outcomes, and discipline to millions of students.

Gaurav said the creator space is close to his heart because he was 15 when he started blogging and then he became a creator on Quora and then on YouTube. In fact teaching on YouTube led to the start of Unacademy, he said.

""So this whole space where passionate people are creating something and building their following for that space and helping them monetise better is something which is very close to my heart and that's why I believe that Qoohoo is going to be big,"" Gaurav said.

The investments injected over Rs 38,000 crore, mainly driven by favourable shifts in the global economic scenario and strong domestic macroeconomic outlook.

The investment came following a modest investment of Rs 1,539 crore in February and a massive outflow of Rs 25,743 crore in January, the data said.

According to the data, apart from equities, the FPIs have injected a massive Rs 13,223 crore into the debt market this month.

It came in the backdrop of Bloomberg announcing India's bonds inclusion in its Emerging Market (EM) Local Currency Government Index and related indices from January 31 next year.

With this, the FPIs investment has turned positive to the tune of Rs 13,893 crore in equities so far in 2024 and Rs 55,480 crore in the debt market.

Notably, the recent market correction has provided a buying opportunity.

Experts believed that the FPIs influx can be attributed to robust GDP growth and expectations of a potential shift in the RBI's policy, possibly leading to rate cuts of 25-50 basis points in the latter half of fiscal 2025.

Last week, the FPIs turned net sellers, although marginally, to the tune of USD 314 million. This could be largely attributed to FPIs adopting a cautious approach.

FPIs have been investing in the debt markets for the past few months. They invested Rs 22,419 crore in February and Rs 19,836 crore in January.",thestatesman.com,news,The Statesman,,0.1372549019607843,448975745,1,https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_1007.png,eng-9420238

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border....That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24 percent increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks.

According to The Express Tribune, experts have highlighted that Pakistan currently has an opportune moment to fulfill the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), improve tax collection, and notably increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by clamping down on illicit activities within the tobacco sector.

The IMF has recently suggested that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) should implement a standardized excise duty on all domestically produced cigarettes, regardless of their manufacturer, with the aim of generating additional revenue. However, it has been noted that tax revenue from the tobacco industry mainly comes from just two legal companies, as the FBR has struggled to bring illicit cigarette manufacturers into the tax fold.

Cracking down on illicit tobacco trade holds the potential to significantly boost annual revenue from the industry to Rs 600 billion, a considerable increase from the current Rs 250 billion. This effort is in line with the government's goal of raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20% and addressing economic challenges effectively.

Osama Siddiqui, a microeconomic analyst, emphasized that tackling illicit tobacco trade is not merely about revenue but also about meeting IMF requirements and bolstering Pakistan's economic resilience. This initiative could substantially contribute to improving tax collection and enhancing the tax-to-GDP ratio.

Recent industry data highlighted by The Express Tribune indicates a notable increase in the market share of illicit cigarettes, now comprising 63% of the market. This underscores the urgent need for intervention to address the growing gap, attributed to the affordability of untaxed alternatives due to higher prices of legal cigarettes, resulting in a significant loss of tax revenue amounting to PKR 310 billion.

Siddiqui further emphasized that addressing illicit tobacco trade is not only a fiscal necessity but also a strategic move to fund crucial sectors such as infrastructure development, healthcare, and education.

By taking decisive measures to combat this issue, Pakistan can lay the foundation for economic growth, fulfill international obligations, and secure essential resources for national development.",newsx.com,news,NewsX,,0.2941176470588236,448975386,1,https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WEBSITE-TEMPLATE-17-1.jpg,eng-9421229

The White House announced the signing on Saturday (Mar 23) after the US Senate approved the package in the early morning hours. That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the US-Mexico border.

""I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished,"" Biden said in a statement on Saturday.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (Nato's) top civilian official said last week that Ukraine is ""running out of ammunition"", echoing warnings by the country's allies, including the US.

The funding package increases defence appropriations by 3 per cent while keeping overall domestic spending flat. Temporary spending measures had funded the federal government for the first six months of the federal fiscal year.

Though the Senate session dragged past midnight, the White House said it was ending preparations for a shutdown. Federal agencies weren't affected by the short lapse because ""obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis"", it said in a statement.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said as he announced a deal to end a Republican filibuster, clearing the way for the bill to pass the Senate on a 74-24 vote.

There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

Why could Roblox be a once-in-a-generation opportunity?

Metaverse technology is still in its relative infancy. The global metaverse industry is just starting to gain serious traction. According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Massive long-term potential

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

The bottom line

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.

A senior World Economic Forum (WEF) official highlighted that a combination of policy changes such as bankruptcy law and taxation code, as well as the enabling environment created by digital public infrastructure (DPI), have made India an appealing investment destination for the financial technology sector.

According to PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at WEF, noted India's exceptional performance in global markets, attracting substantial investments.

Blake also cautioned that there was a need to educate investors because markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and are prone to ""ups and downs"". ""So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),"" he stated.

""I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,"" he also said.

According to Blake, a survey of fintech CEOs conducted by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance found that 70% of firms saw AI as a major force that could be used to personalise and customise products and services. Blake also stated that sectoral regulators could benefit from AI in terms of risk management and that they must adapt to rapid technological changes.

""The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,"" he outlined.

Blake emphasised that in the Asia-Pacific region, regulatory agencies were generally regarded as highly skilled.

""When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,"" he added. ""One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,"" Blake further added.

""It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set. That is a rather large challenge, but it's something that we as a team are looking at currently and trying to devote some time to,"" Blake emphasised.

The January release of the WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth' revealed that most financial technology firms maintain a favorable perception of their regulatory landscape, with 63 per cent deeming it satisfactory.

A similar incident unfolded in Pune, where a woman found herself duped after getting entangled in a fraudulent investment scheme.

The victim, a woman from Pune, became a target of fraudsters who enticed her with promises of quick returns through a trading app. (Also Read: IPO Calendar: 11 Public Offerings To Hit Market This Week; Details Here)

According to reports from The Times of India, the scam took place between January 2 and February 4. The woman initiated her trading activities through a mobile app, which was downloaded at the behest of the scamsters.

The fraudsters, masquerading as investment advisors, persuaded the woman to invest in a scheme offering high returns. Believing their claims, the woman poured her savings into the scheme and even sold her jewelry to invest more.

She received messages through the trading app, luring her with the promise of substantial profits. However, within a month, she lost over Rs 24.12 lakhs, falling victim to the scam.

The Police Report

The woman, realizing she had been deceived, lodged a complaint at the Sinhgad Road police station in Pune. As per police inspectors, she was continuously encouraged to invest more money in the fraudulent scheme.

The fraudsters provided her with four bank account numbers, into which she transferred the funds gradually.

This incident adds to the growing number of investment fraud cases reported in Pune. Over the past two months, the city has witnessed 117 cases of investment fraud, including another instance where a woman lost Rs 67 lakhs.

Gaming platform Roblox (RBLX -1.14%) has been an incredible growth story in recent years. There are over 71 million daily active users (DAUs) and about 16 million paying members. Roblox users spent 60 billion hours on the platform last year, and the company has done a fantastic job of monetizing its experiences.

Despite the incredible growth, Roblox could still be in the early chapters of its growth story. Management has big plans for the business, and it could be a major beneficiary of one of the most promising technology trends in the market right now.

Metaverse technology is still in its relative infancy. The global metaverse industry is just starting to gain serious traction. According to research firm Markets and Markets, the global metaverse market was about $84 billion in size in 2023 and is expected to grow exponentially to more than $1.3 trillion by 2023.

Roblox has a big first-mover advantage. It is arguably the closest thing we have to a true metaverse gaming experience in the industry today. And as wearable technology evolves and its adoption continues to grow, Roblox should get some incredible tailwinds.

Even with its large scale, Roblox continues to grow rapidly. In the fourth quarter, the company's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and margin continues to move in the right direction. Operating cash flow grew by 20% and for the full year, and while the business isn't profitable on a net income basis yet, a clear path to profitability is starting to emerge.

Management has big goals for the business. While 71.5 million DAUs may sound like a lot, and it is, Roblox's leaders believe they can scale the platform to 1 billion over the long run. The platform continues to launch on new devices -- for example, Roblox just became available on Sony PlayStation and Meta Quest in the fourth quarter -- and this growth could help boost the user base in the near term.

Not only does Roblox plan to grow its user base roughly 14 times from the current level, but there are also other potential catalysts for top- and bottom-line growth.

For one thing, Roblox is doing an excellent job of finding and implementing new ways to monetize its users. To date, most of Roblox's revenue comes from the sale of Robux, its virtual currency for in-game purchases, but it has also started to sell advertising on its platform, creating a fast-growing and high-margin revenue stream. The company has just started to roll out video ads, and there are tremendous opportunities for immersive advertising as the platform and its related technologies evolve. Plus, Roblox is planning to launch capabilities for its content creators to sell physical items through the platform, which could open an entirely new revenue stream.

Roblox has established an excellent track record of growth and is starting to show investors a clear path to profitability. The results so far have been extremely impressive, but we could still be seeing just a tiny fraction of Roblox's long-term potential. As more immersive devices roll out from manufacturers from Apple and Meta Platforms, among others, and Roblox's user base and monetization continue to improve, Roblox could be a massive winner.

Of course, there's a lot that needs to go right for Roblox to reach its billion-user target and become a dominant experiential platform. This isn't likely to be a low-volatility or low-risk investment. But if the company can execute on its growth strategy, this could be a generational wealth creator for patient investors.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Matt Frankel,0.4039215686274509,448972371,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770051/gaming-2022.jpg,

The technical summary data tells us to buy MGR near 24.15, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 24.08 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 24.15 is the first level of support below 24.37, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 24.15 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

The lights are brighter in downtown Honolulu where post-­pandemic changes to work and lifestyle patterns are fueling an investment cycle that is expected to deliver at least 15 new projects valued at about $1 billion over the next five to seven years.

During the pandemic, low interest rates and the quest for wide-open spaces drove many Oahu homebuyers into the suburbs, especially as employers began offering remote and hybrid work options. Vacancy rates rose in office buildings in Honolulu's prime central business district.

The change has drawn investors who hope to convert excess office space into residential rentals and fee-simple housing, hotels, educational space, retail, activity centers, food and beverage venues, and community services like dog parks and senior care.

The result is expected to yield a more balanced market that improves safety and allows downtown Honolulu to thrive outside of the traditional 7 a.m.-to-4 p.m. work window.

Christine Camp, president and CEO of Avalon Development Co., provided the $1 billion estimate to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser last week.

""Avalon isn't the first. We're just the latest and we won't be the last,"" Camp said.""There's a huge wave of investment that will bring fundamental changes. When you have that many people in a six-block radius thinking about the same things it will happen.""

Camp's remarks followed the blessing of Modea, the company's reuse project that will turn part of the 22-story Davies Pacific Center into a fee-simple condominium with 352 units. New life is also planned for the former Fort Street Walmart, which Avalon acquired this month for $38 million.

Camp said Avalon's recent purchases of at least three city blocks puts the company among the major stakeholders committed to the downtown revitalization.

Other stakeholders in the revitalization include: Douglas Emmett, Continental Assets Management, 'Ikenakea, Rick Cho, Colbert Matsumoto, Hemick, Central Pacific Bank, Hawaii State Federal Credit Union, Hawaiian Host and Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Hawai'i Pacific University, the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and Catholic Charities Hawaii's Housing Development Corp., and WKF Inc., lead by Duane and Robert Kurisu.

Camp said WKF has been moving businesses displaced from the Keeaumoku district into downtown, such as Evergreen Adult Day Care, which is going into the Hansmann Building, as well as supporting new growth across the downtown blocks that they own.

Mark Bratton, senior vice president for Colliers International, agreed with Camp's estimate and said that together, these stakeholders are making a difference by reviving a conversion trend that started in Honolulu and cities across America before the pandemic.

""When you look back at 2018 and 2019 in downtown, the health of the businesses, the retail and art community and Chinatown, things were thriving,"" he said. ""The pandemic dealt it a huge blow like a lot of downtowns around the country, most notably San Francisco.

""Lucky for us we have these handful of local leaders willing to stand up and invest and take on risk to reinvigorate downtown. It's taken several years to reset from the pandemic, and the only way out of it is to reinvest and make it a thriving 24-hour marketplace.""

Camp said there were already signs that downtown was ripe for change before Avalon bought the Davies Pacific Center.

She said in 2021, Hemic converted the American Savings Bank Building, which the bank had vacated in 2018, into office space for over 100 employees. She said Central Pacific Bank also completed a $40 million investment in its downtown headquarters in 2021.

Camp said the Hawaii State Federal Credit Union opened in June 2023 with 230 employees. There's also a new Hawaiian Host and Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts headquarters.

After the opening of The Residences at Bishop Place, a Douglas Emmett residential rental conversion at 1132 Bishop St., Camp said she knew there was enough demand for Modea if people were willing to pay $2,375 monthly rent for a studio and $3,725 for a two-bedroom with extra fees for parking and pets.

Modea, at 1698 Queen St., is aimed at Hawaii's middle-income singles, families with small kids, and what Camp refers to as ""sinkwads and dinkwads,"" which translates into single or double incomes, no kids with a dog.

F. Kevin Aucello, principal and co-founder of Powell & Aucello, said the new residential and food and beverage development combined with downtown's proximity to businesses and government buildings also has fueled a hotel investment cycle. He said 'Ikenakea's Chris Flaherty is developing a 15-story, 240-unit hotel at 112 N. Nimitz Highway. Aucello said the hotel, which is near a future Skyline station and overlooks Honolulu Harbor, is likely to be branded a Hyatt.

Aucello said another possibility is the conversion of the three-story Wo Fat Building at 115 Hotel St. A partnership team, including Donald Kenney, former University of Hawaii football coach June Jones, Dickie Chang and John Davenport, have announced their intention to build a 100-seat ground-floor restaurant topped with 23 luxury hotel rooms.

""I think we'll see at least a couple more downtown hotels in addition to what's already opened. Interest will depend on how many get completed,"" Aucello said.

He said the planned hotels would join the longtime Aston at the Executive Centre Hotel and the newly opened AC Hotel by Marriott Honolulu, which ""has been a smashing success.""

Pandemic recovery

Patricia Chang Moad, vice president of operations for Continental Assets Management, a private real estate investment company founded by her father, Andy Chang, was an early pioneer to the current downtown development cycle. The company developed the recently opened 112-room AC Hotel by Marriott Honolulu at 1111 Bishop St. in the old Remington College office building.

""COVID hit two months into escrow. We were shell-shocked,"" Moad said. ""It was a ghost town and there was a point where we had to decide whether to move forward. But I've been a professional in downtown Honolulu for 15 years and my chosen playground has always been downtown and Chinatown, and we strongly believe in this community of hardworking business owners.""

Moad said Honolulu's pandemic recovery has been slow, but ultimately has paid off. The proof is in the robust occupancy rate since the Dec. 12 hotel opening as well as ""all the influx of business owners who believe in this market and are now investing a considerable amount of capital.""

""We are so excited to be at the forefront of this renaissance of downtown,"" she said. ""We're bullish on downtown and we are planning even more investment.""

Developers often succeed because they can read the tea leaves, finding that bit of future left after the cup is otherwise empty -- and there has been a lot of empty in downtown Honolulu.

Mike Hamasu, Colliers International research and consulting director, said Oahu's office vacancy rate, which had improved to 10% in 2019, rose above 13% in 2023, and was expected to continue climbing.

""But with all the office conversions that have started or are being planned, we are projecting maybe by 2025 there may be a reduction of about 1 million square feet of office space. Without that, a lot of it would have probably been vacant space, so a vacancy rate that might have skyrocketed to about 16% is hovering at about 14%,"" he said.

Jamie Brown, president and owner of brokerage firm Hawaii Commercial Real Estate LLC, said a reason that downtown Honolulu was hit hard by the pandemic was its office footprint, which historically ""has been about 50% of the office inventory of the entire island, and virtually the entire state.""

Brown, nicknamed ""Downtown Jamie Brown"" by colleagues, said the The Residences at Bishop Place offset the office market decline during the pandemic, and Modea saved the office market from its post-pandemic hangover.

""This stuff all started a few years ago, but because of permitting you are just now starting to see the fruits of everyone's labors,"" he said. ""What's occurring now is the biggest change to the Honolulu office market since the mid 1990s, when we built a whole lot of office buildings. That was an exciting time, but what followed was a pretty healthy recession and we never really worked out all the supply.""

Brown said demand for the remaining downtown office space will rise. He said Thursday that he received his first email since before the pandemic from an investor looking to make a downtown office investment. ""It's going to be turbocharged by all the other investments in downtown,"" Brown said.

New additions

Change is coming fast. The convenience store 88 Mart last year filled the Executive Centre space vacated by Longs in 2022. Paris Baguette opened on Bishop Street in February and Bratton said ""their opening days were better than any of their other Paris Baguette stores that have ever opened in the U.S.""

New opportunities will accompany Avalon's redevelopment of the Fort Street Walmart, which spans 87,000 square feet of space and 454 parking spaces, at South King and Bethel streets.

Camp said Avalon Group plans to build about 100 residential units above the property's parking garage and set aside half of the building for recreational entertainment and half for commercial use. The plan is to add a new tower behind Walmart with retail on the ground floor and about 300 units on top, she said.

Avalon's plans also include adding pickleball courts and a ""destination dog park"" for residents and guests outside of the building, she said.

Other Avalon downtown projects include consulting on the Diocese of Honolulu and Catholic Charities Hawaii's Housing Development Corporation's senior housing project Hale Kamiano. And the firm is working on Hawaii Pacific University's three-story Science Hall under construction.

Camp said downtown revitalization has been helped by the growing concentration of large business owners with common goals. She said Tradewind Capital Chairman Colbert Matsumoto is putting together a block of property owners who can move in sync with the first meeting planned for May.

She said existing owners are working together to beef up security to address concerns about crime and homelessness, and are exploring forming their own business improvement district.

""There's a Fort Street Improvement District already. But it's time for a downtown district. This is a place where major investment needs to be made,"" she said.",staradvertiser.com,news,Honolulu Star Advertiser,Allison Schaefers,0.2392156862745098,448971422,1,https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/web1_20240324-a1-CTY-modea-6119.jpg,

You'll forget about it if you have one or more pairs of jeans in your wardrobe that are cut to fit. They can be worn with blouses, T-shirts, shirts, tops, vests, or, for example, with tweed, denim or oversized jackets made of suit fabric.

In the OBOZ.UA article, we have prepared a selection of jeans that you can't go wrong with. They will be in trend not only in 2024 but at least in the next 5 years.

1. Straight jeans

Go for high-waisted models with long legs that cover the ankles. They will not distort the proportions of the figure and will visually stretch the silhouette. It is advisable to choose a universal color: blue, black, milk, graphite or chocolate.

2. Wide-leg jeans

Over the past few seasons, millions of fashionistas around the world have fallen in love with wide-leg jeans. Why? They have ankle legs that smoothly expand from the hips: this helps to delicately adjust the parameters of the figure. In addition, the high rise visually makes women look slimmer. This year, jeans with slits at the waist will be the most popular. However, do not rush to buy them. They will likely quickly leave the trends due to impracticality.

3. Flared jeans

This is another model that can become your favorite. The fact is that flared jeans visually reduce the volume of the hips due to the cut extended from the knees. In 2024, elongated products with disco-style legs or small slits at the bottom will be in demand.

4. Printed jeans

If your wardrobe is dominated by business attire and neutral base colors such as gray, black, burgundy, beige, etc., then complement them with accent jeans. For example, with animal, floral, or abstract patterns. Pants with polka dot print will also be an interesting addition to the outfit.

5. Jeans with semicircular legs

These can be ""horseshoe"" jeans or relaxed barrel-leg jeans. Their legs widen at the hips and taper to the ankle. It is advisable to style these jeans with a fitted or cropped top. Otherwise, you risk creating a shapeless silhouette.",eng.obozrevatel.com,news,Obozrevatel,,0.07450980392156858,448971413,1,https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/3/24/fotoram-io1.jpg?size=2010x1050,eng-9421470

At a school board meeting on March 11, Superintendent Anita Huggins recommended implementing a new budgeting method for the upcoming fiscal year. The method is a weighted student funding formula designed to provide resources to schools based on individual student needs and student demographics.

The school district currently funds schools based on student enrollment. The weighted student-based formula proposed by Huggins would consider a new ratio where pupils in poverty, multilingual students and students with disabilities would be weighted higher than students who do not fit these categories.

This would result in increased funds to schools, which, as Huggins' team explained, would benefit all scholars in attendance.

""I want to make sure the public understands that this isn't taking from one school to give to another, but instead it's a way to support all kids across the system,"" Huggins said.

Michelle Simmons, CCSD's chief academic officer, said that transitioning to a weighted student-based formula would sustain the academic gains that the district has seen over the last couple of years with ESSER-funded programs. This model would also increase school autonomy.

Education Lab CCSD shares plan to decrease chronic absenteeism during national attendance crisis By Valerie Nava vnava@postandcourier.com

""This new funding formula will give schools and principals the ability to shore up their programs where they believe they need the most resources,"" she said.

The new ratios proposed by Huggins were 3 to 1 for elementary schools, 4 to 1 for middle schools, and 6 to 1 for high schools. Simmons explained that, in practice, this would mean that for every three, four or six students that fit the three categories laid out, an additional student would be added.

The funding model would cost the district $30.2 million, 12 percent of the $250 million received through ESSER funds. If approved, the district plans to sustain the weighted student funding model for the next few years.

A growing trend

Weighted student funding models are being implemented by school districts across the nation such as Denver, Chicago, and even Charlotte-Mecklenburg in North Carolina. No other district in South Carolina has shifted to weighted student funding, making CCSD the first district in the state to implement it if it gets approved by the school board.

Although research on the effectiveness of weighted student funding is limited, scholars and education experts have begun to document ways districts nationwide are shifting to this model and its impact on student outcomes.

Studies show that districts can freely decide which categories of students they will account for in their formulas. Therefore, there is no such thing as a standard way of implementing the model.

A study conducted by the Edunomics Lab, an education research center at Georgetown University, suggested that districts tailor this model to reflect their own spending history and local context.

Research indicates that if districts decide to shift to this model, it's because they have identified a need for more equity, autonomy and flexibility.

Marguerite Roza, director of the Edunomics Lab, said that this model better suits districts that have been under pressure regarding transparency on how they allocate their funds.

Under weighted student funding, principals become the financial leaders of their schools. They have discretion over the funds allocated to their schools and use them to best serve their students.

Advocates said it allows principals to use funds in ways that better meet their students' needs, as well as involve parents and teachers, who most times are left out in this process. Yet, Edunomics found most of them have not received formal financial training or certifications, which would help them to better serve the role of financial leaders of their schools.

Roza said that over time, principals are responsive to their schools' issues.

""I think some of the districts are worried (principals) don't have the skills to do this. And it is one of those things that you learn as you have to do it. You learn that financial stuff as you do it,"" she said.

Experts added that there are limits on how principals can use funds. Eric Hanushek, an education economist at Stanford University, said that principals don't have control over teachers' salaries since these are determined by school districts.

Another common criticism of the model is that if enrollment rates drop, the schools would receive less funding and potentially close.

Roza said this was a misconception.

""(People) blame the formula, and they think there just would be a lot more money in the system if it weren't for the formula. And that's not necessarily true,"" she said. ""It's a formula. It doesn't decide the amount of money, it decides how to divvy it up.""

Guardrails and clear goals are keys to success

Experts said it's imperative that districts place clear-cut boundaries around the ways principals decide to spend their funds.

""You can't allow each individual school to act like a school district and go out and hire people, or decide how many to hire and so forth, without some guardrails on it,"" Hanushek said.

This matter was discussed at the budget workshop meeting, with Huggins stating that she and her team are actively working on developing guardrails around the model.

""With this sort of system comes more transparency to the public, but also increased accountability,"" she said. ""We want to have some significant guardrails in place to make sure things don't go awry and that they don't go awry quickly.""

Roza, the director of the Edunomics Lab, said that ultimately a weighted student funding model can be a helpful, but not sufficient, strategy, and that although changing a funding formula is not a ""quick fix,"" districts that move toward this model do see improvements in terms of equity.

""I think that any model you implement, you have to implement it well, it has to be kind of consistent. People need to be trained and stay focused on the outcomes,"" she said. ""But a lot of the districts that implemented it, did it because they were under a lot of pressure to address inequities in their system.""

Roza explained that with a weighted student funding model, resources are delivered more deliberately and equitably across schools.

""So, where you might have had some schools that draw down more than their share of dollars, or some that got shortchanged, weighted student funding seems to eliminate that,"" she said.

Roza highlighted that one of the keys to this model delivering results is keeping a clear goal in mind in terms of desired outcomes, whether that be increasing math or reading scores, or higher student attendance. This, combined with more equity and higher flexibility that the model brings, can increase the chances of driving improvements in terms of student outcomes.

The IMF recently proposed that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) impose a uniform excise duty on all locally manufactured cigarettes, irrespective of the manufacturer's origin, to generate additional revenue.

However, tax revenue from the tobacco sector predominantly originates from just two legal companies, as the FBR has completely failed to bring the illicit cigarette manufacturers into the tax net, as per The Express Tribune

With the potential to enhance annual revenue from the tobacco industry to Rs600 billion, up from the current Rs250 billion, cracking down on the illicit tobacco trade is seen as a crucial step. This move aligns with the government's ambition to elevate the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20% and address Pakistan's economic challenges more effectively.

""Curbing the illicit tobacco trade is not just about revenue; it is also about meeting IMF conditions and strengthening Pakistan's economic resilience. This initiative can significantly contribute to enhancing tax collection and improving the tax-to-GDP ratio,"" said Osama Siddiqui, a microeconomic analyst.

According to The Express Tribune, recent industry data reveals a surge in the market share of illicit cigarettes, now standing at 63 per cent, emphasising the pressing need for intervention. The widening gap, attributed to the higher prices of legal cigarettes, has propelled consumers towards more affordable, untaxed alternatives, leading to a staggering loss of Pakistani currency (PKR) 310 billion in tax revenue.

He added that addressing the illicit tobacco trade was not just a fiscal necessity but also a strategic move to fund infrastructure development, healthcare and education.

By taking decisive steps to combat this issue, Pakistan can pave the way for economic growth, meet international obligations and secure vital resources for national development."" (ANI)

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it.

He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.",westhawaiitoday.com,news,West Hawaii Today,none,0.192156862745098,448971201,1,https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/og_image_logo.png,spa-3422544

Because it's an investment in the Stark community,"Our community is brimming with cultural richness and artistic vibrancy.

In fact, a study conducted last year by the National Center for Arts Research named the Canton-Massillon community as the eighth most arts-vibrant mid-size community in the United States. In order to maintain and grow this arts-vibrancy, it is important that we, as a community, rally support around our county arts campaign.

For more than 50 years, ArtsinStark has been an anchor of the Stark County community; dedicated to elevating the arts for all people of all ages.

This nonprofit organization has several key roles. ArtsinStark operates the iconic Cultural Center for the Arts that is home to the Canton Museum of Art, Canton Ballet, Sing Stark and the Cultural Theater. ArtsinStark also provides support to the community's seven major arts groups, including those housed at the Cultural Center along with Canton Symphony Orchestra, Massillon Museum, Canton Palace Theatre and the Bluecoats. And, ArtsinStark provides vital grants for hundreds of local artists and nonprofit organizations.

In order to provide this financial support to organizations and individuals, ArtsinStark turns to the community for support of its annual arts campaign. This year, ArtsinStark is committed to growing its impact and has set a campaign fundraising goal of $1.4 million.

When you support the campaign, you are helping to address community challenges and opportunities. ArtsinStark grants and support are focused on three primary areas: Arts and Education, Arts and Well-being, and Arts and Vitality.

Arts and Education

Lifelong arts education is a focus of ArtsinStark.

One example of arts and education in action is the local SmARTs program. SmARTs provides innovative curriculum to all Stark County's school districts. Area artists work with classroom teachers to blend arts with traditional academics.

The results are impressive. Students who have participated in the SmARTs program showed a 20 percentage point increase in test scores. SmARTs and other educational programs demonstrate how the arts are fundamental to a well-rounded education, nurturing creativity, critical thinking and cultural awareness.

By supporting the Stark County arts campaign, the community invests in the next generation of artists, innovators and leaders.

Arts and Well-being

Engaging with the arts has been linked to numerous health benefits, including reduced stress, enhanced cognitive function and improved overall well-being.

By investing in the arts, Stark County promotes the health and happiness of its residents. Programming across Stark County provides arts as a means to help heal.

Outreach like the Canton Museum of Art's Art for Health and Healing Program offers unique art therapy services to area residents struggling with physical or mental health issues. Whether it is by creating art or simply being an observer, Stark County residents have plentiful opportunities for social connection and community engagement, reducing feelings of isolation and fostering a sense of belonging.

Arts and Vitality

By supporting the county arts campaign, the community fuels economic prosperity. Art equates to economic impact here in Stark County.

Beyond its cultural significance, the Stark County arts campaign is a driving force behind economic growth and revitalization. Studies have consistently shown that investment in the arts yields substantial returns, stimulating tourism, attracting businesses and generating employment opportunities. Last year, cultural tourism efforts generated $21.5 million of economic impact to our community.

By supporting ArtsinStark, residents contribute to educational enrichment, community well-being and economic growth of Stark County. Now more than ever, it is essential that Stark County comes together to invest in its artistic legacy, ensuring that the arts continue to thrive and flourish for generations to come.

Please consider a gift to the ArtsinStark annual arts campaign. Your support of the campaign is not just a donation; it's an investment in our community.

In a video interview with PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the WEF said India has been one of the best-performing markets in the world and investors have made money here. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Blake also struck a word of caution saying that since markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and were prone to ""ups and downs"", there was a need to educate investors. ""So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),"" he said. ""I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,"" he said. Blake said a survey of fintech CEOs by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had revealed that 70 per cent of the firms considered AI as a major force and could be deployed for personalisation and customisation of products and services. Blake said for sectoral regulators, AI could be helpful in the context of risk management and there was a need for them to adapt to the rapid changes in technology. ""The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,"" he said. Blake said in the Asia-Pacific region, the regulatory agencies were generally viewed as being quite skillful. ""When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,"" he said. ""One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,"" Blake said. ""It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set. That is a rather large challenge, but it's something that we as a team are looking at currently and trying to devote some time to,"" Blake said. The WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth', released in January, found that the majority of financial technology companies hold a positive view of their regulatory environment, with 63 per cent rating it as adequate.

The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.

Speaking to reporters in the Swiss city of Geneva on Friday, Adam Abdelmoula, resident coordinator in Syria for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, stated that ""Today, we are facing an unprecedented situation in Syria -- one that we cannot afford to ignore"".

The UN official cited key statistics on the crisis, including the fact that around 16.7 million people in Syria require some form of humanitarian assistance - an increase from 15.3 million last year - and that over 7 million people remain internally displaced, with almost as many being refugees in other countries abroad and in the region.

As a result of those dire statistics, Abdelmoula revealed that the UN is seeking $4.07 billion to provide urgent and life-saving aid to 10.8 million Syrians. Highlighting that Syria's humanitarian crisis remains ""one of the most deadly to civilians in the world"", he stressed that ""Inaction will be costly for all of us and will inevitably lead to additional suffering.""

READ: War in Syria has dragged a generation into insecurity and deprivation

After thirteen years of the ongoing conflict in the country, 90 per cent of Syria's population are reportedly below the poverty line, and the situation is made worse by the fact that millions of them are expected to suffer in severe shortages of food due to a shortfall in the necessary funding. That lack of funds has become so drastic that, in January, the UN's World Food Program (WFP) was forced to end its main assistance program in Syria.

Furthermore, humanitarian aid to the country has been affected by numerous other conflicts in the world. ""We are competing with so many crises. If you look at the global picture, you have Gaza, you have Ukraine, you have Sudan, you have Afghanistan... and the list goes on and on"", Abdelmoula said.

""With each emerging crisis, the Syria one that is now over a decade-old keeps being pushed to the back burner"", the UN official lamented. ""We are struggling to keep it in the global attention. And that is proving to be challenging every year.""",middleeastmonitor.com,news,Middle East Monitor,,-0.3098039215686275,448969814,1,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AA-20240122-33499018-33499017-SYRIAN_REFUGEES_STRUGGLE_WITH_COLD_WINTER_IN_IDLIB.jpg,eng-9417486

Experts said that the new project opens the way for other successive investments in the world of comics, explaining that such activities attract giant international companies specialized in entertainment to invest in Saudi Arabia.

The General Manager and CEO of Abdul Mohsen Al Hokair Company, Majed Al Hokair, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the establishment of an amusement park inspired by the Japanese animation series targets many segments of society and fans of comics.

He added that the project will contribute to achieving the new strategy of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz to attract more than 150 million visitors annually during 2030.

""Diversification in projects provides an integrated destination with multiple choices, extending the days spent by visitors to Saudi Arabia over long periods, in addition to creating job and other opportunities,"" Al Hokair remarked.

For his part, the founder and CEO of Amla Tourism Investment Company, Nasser Al-Ghaylan, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Dragon Ball was one of the new qualitative projects that encourage local and international companies to invest in Saudi Arabia.

He added that the project will have a positive impact on the private sector's contribution to the Kingdom's GDP.

This announcement comes at a time when Qiddiya entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Toei Animation, the Japanese animation company and creator of the original Dragon Ball characters.

The Managing Director of the Qiddiya Investment Company, Abdullah bin Nasser Al-Daoud, stated that the partnership will help create an exceptional entertainment park that provides a unique combination of adventures and fun, as well as a diverse entertainment experience suitable for all tastes.",english.aawsat.com,news,Asharq Al-Awsat English,,0.4509803921568627,448969691,1,https://english.aawsat.com/s3/files/styles/1200x600/public/2024-03/586027_0.jpeg,eng-9416856

The IMF recently proposed that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) impose a uniform excise duty on all locally manufactured cigarettes, irrespective of the manufacturer's origin, to generate additional revenue.

However, tax revenue from the tobacco sector predominantly originates from just two legal companies, as the FBR has completely failed to bring the illicit cigarette manufacturers into the tax net, as per The Express Tribune

With the potential to enhance annual revenue from the tobacco industry to Rs600 billion, up from the current Rs250 billion, cracking down on the illicit tobacco trade is seen as a crucial step. This move aligns with the government's ambition to elevate the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20% and address Pakistan's economic challenges more effectively.

""Curbing the illicit tobacco trade is not just about revenue; it is also about meeting IMF conditions and strengthening Pakistan's economic resilience. This initiative can significantly contribute to enhancing tax collection and improving the tax-to-GDP ratio,"" said Osama Siddiqui, a microeconomic analyst.

According to The Express Tribune, recent industry data reveals a surge in the market share of illicit cigarettes, now standing at 63 per cent, emphasising the pressing need for intervention. The widening gap, attributed to the higher prices of legal cigarettes, has propelled consumers towards more affordable, untaxed alternatives, leading to a staggering loss of Pakistani currency (PKR) 310 billion in tax revenue.

He added that addressing the illicit tobacco trade was not just a fiscal necessity but also a strategic move to fund infrastructure development, healthcare and education.

By taking decisive steps to combat this issue, Pakistan can pave the way for economic growth, meet international obligations and secure vital resources for national development.""

The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

If Nvidia is the king of AI, Arm Holdings is arguably the queen.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.

December last year, I began covering several BDCs and one of them was Fidus Investment (NASDAQ:FDUS). At that time considering FDUS's fundamentals and market environment, I decided to assume a more neutral stance setting a ""hold"" rating.

Since the publication of my article, the BDC has underperformed the benchmark by roughly 230 basis points (on a total return basis).

In general, early start of 2024 has brought many divergences in the BDC space, where the gap between outperformers and underperformers has been rather wide. For example, we see that BDCs, which focus more on the VC-side and carry relatively aggressive investment exposures have suffered quite a lot given the muted activity in the capital markets and increased corporate distress within several areas of economy.

In this period, FDUS has, however, generated relatively stable results with the total returns still landing in the positive territory.

This goes hand in hand with what I also elaborated in the article:

So from a high-level fundamental perspective, FDUS indeed looks an enticing BDC given the more challenging macro environment, where defense is clearly preferred.

Yet, there were a couple of aspects that held me back from establishing a buy rating:

In the grand scheme of things, these are not major drawbacks, but still they certainly do not improve the overall picture for FDUS.

Let's now analyse FDUS's Q4, 2023 earnings package and see whether the BDC has become more attractive, where the fundamentals could justify a buy.

At the income level, Fidus managed to deliver improved results on a quarter on quarter basis, which in itself could be deemed a success. Many BDCs out there have struggled to protect the achieved income levels in Q3, 2023 from going down during Q4.

For the quarter, the total investment income was $36.3 million, which translates to a $2.1 million increase from. The key component driving this was the interest income that was supported by an increase in average debt investment balances outstanding (i.e., larger asset base from which to capture spreads). Again, in the context of the overall BDC space, experiencing an uptick in the asset base in Q4 could be viewed as a positive signal, something that has not been observes for quite many BDCs.

Now, the table below depicts nicely the key metrics on a per share level.

One of the most important metrics - Net investment income or NII - declined during Q4 going from $0.63 per share in Q3 to $0.58 per share now.

However, here we have to really make some adjustments for capital gains and incentive fee accruals as well as reversals attributable to ""paper"" value changes in assets. If we exclude this ""non-core"" items, the adjusted NII for Q4 landed at $0.65 per share, down by $0.03 per share from Q3 level.

The major driver behind the drop in adjusted NII figure is the combination of additional equity issuance and slight spread compression during Q4.

Now, looking at the portfolio level, I would say there were a couple of interesting dynamics that are worth underscoring.

First, it is clear how Fidus has shifted its focus on first lien by dedicating most of the incremental investments right into this category. As a result, the first lien bucket has increased accordingly, constituting ~ 62% of the total asset mix.

Second, during the quarter, FDUS achieved a solid portfolio growth (in fact, for several quarters in a row). New investment volumes totaled ~ $132 million from which $110 million or ca. 90% of the new debt investments (i.e., excluding equity component) was linked to first lien. Again, this is a clear testament of the Management's focus on safer asset exposure than second lien or subordinated structures.

Granted, there were several organic exits and / or debt repayments, but on a net level, the portfolio expanded by ~ $20 million, which warrants a larger asset pool from which to complement adjusted NII generation going forward. In the current environment this is really positive as several peers have been struggling to keep the pipeline active, at sufficient level to preserve the existing asset base.

Third, the situation at the non-accrual end was excellent as there were no new bad investments recognized during the Q4. As of year-end, FDUS had just two companies under the non-accrual status accounting for ~ 1% of the total portfolio (FV terms).

Finally, the leverage has improved. Currently, Fidus carries a debt to equity of circa 79%, which is significantly below the sector average of 118%.

Moreover, FDUS has managed to structure the debt maturity profile very well, fixing and back-end loading several debt instruments at favorable terms. Currently, the weighted average interest rate stands at 4.2%, which is considerably below the market-level financing rate and, most importantly, locked in far into the future (i.e., first refinancing kicking in by 2026).

Considering the above, in my opinion, FDUS has become a more enticing investment case.

From the macro perspective, the conditions are still unclear as the M&A and IPO markets are only gradually picking up, without any evidence of strong momentum. Muted transaction activity implies lower supply into the BDC market, which, in turn, renders competition tougher, leading to two issues: (1) lower portfolio yields; (2) difficulties for BDCs to maintain portfolio size. Moreover, it seems that the base case is experiencing three interest rate cuts this year, which will bring down portfolio yield for most BDCs as the lion's share of investments are linked to variable rate.

Yet, looking at FDUS, we can see very positive patterns in the net investment volumes (i.e., growing portfolio) despite the prevailing challenges at the industry level. The focus on conventional businesses, relatively minor portfolio size and equity injections in most of the portfolio companies make it easier to shield and grow the assets under management.

When the interest rates start to fall, FDUS will suffer from spread compression as almost every BDC out there. However, in relative terms, FDUS will be still in a strong position to capture enticing spreads due to very favorable borrowings profile (i.e., below market level cost of financing until mid-2026).

Furthermore, the overall BDC environment is increasingly being characterized by rising non-accrual levels and potential risks that are associated with corporate defaults.

In FDUS's case this risk is well-mitigated as the average interest rate coverage ratio of its portfolio companies at 3x is really strong. For example, it is 2x higher than for FS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK) and significantly above what Oaktree Specialty Lending (NASDAQ:OCSL) embodies. Most importantly, FDUS has one of the lowest leverage levels in the industry, which renders any incremental non-accrual less material as the underlying effects is not that magnified due to higher equity chunk in the structure. The fact that during Q4, 2023 there were no new non-accruals is a solid proof of this.

Finally, we have to underscore the risk stemming from notable exposure to lower quality investments than first lien. In the case of an elevated distress in the economy and for that matter in FDUS's portfolio, the recovery of the invested capital could be definitely more challenging. Yet, there are three reasons, which balance this out:

In a nutshell, Fidus Investment registered a sound performance during Q4, which has helped the Stock price from not going down even as the adjusted NII figure had declined a bit. In my opinion, it was exactly the adjusted NII that kept the Stock price from jumping much higher after the earnings release.

Besides this component, Fidus demonstrated solid progress across the key fundamentals that previously made me a bit more conservative here. For example, we can see how first lien category is increasingly playing a more dominant role, the debt is shrinking and asset base is growing, while the non-accruals remain at very healthy zone.

Given all of this and a slight discount in P/NAV terms (0.98x) despite having no new non-accruals and one of the safest balance sheets in the industry, I consider Fidus Investment a solid buy from here.",seekingalpha.com,news,Seeking Alpha,Roberts Berzins,0.1137254901960785,448968732,1,https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1487894858/image_1487894858.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536,

However, the White House has pledged to repeal the ban on displaying the rainbow flag, symbolizing LGBTQ equality.

The $1.2 trillion package, passed in the early hours of Saturday, contained various additional provisions.

The law prohibits the use of US funds to fly non-official flags at State Department facilities, excluding flags related to the government, prisoners of war, and missing-in-action soldiers.

The Biden administration clarified that the ban does not restrict displaying such flags elsewhere on embassy grounds. The administration assured that the ban would not hinder LGBTQ individuals from serving openly in embassies or celebrating Pride month.

Republican house speaker Mike Johnson highlighted the Pride flag ban to garner support for the bill.

In a statement, the White House emphasized President Biden's commitment to advocating for LGBTQ equality both domestically and internationally. Despite being unable to prevent the flag ban, the White House successfully thwarted over 50 other policy riders targeting the LGBTQ community proposed by Congressional Republicans.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has encouraged displaying the rainbow flag at US missions during Pride month, contrasting with the previous administration's stance.

Former President Barack Obama's administration famously illuminated the White House in rainbow colors in 2015 following the legalization of same-sex marriage by the Supreme Court.

The current administration's support for LGBTQ rights marks a significant departure from the previous government's policies. The White House's efforts to promote LGBTQ equality align with Biden's stance on upholding the rights of marginalized communities.

Protests have been held in Durham and Tyneside after the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) was told it will lose its £1.3m annual grant.

But the incoming North East Mayoral Combined Authority (NEMCA) insists WEA and others will be able to compete for new contracts in the summer.

The charity warns the move risks dozens of courses and the jobs of 72 tutors.

In a statement, NEMCA said adult education providers, including the WEA, would be able to secure contracts through a competitive process.

""In addition to this our local FE colleges and local authorities will receive grant funding for Adult Education activity because of the significant volume of provision they deliver,"" it said.

But WEA warned it will be bidding for a smaller pot of money under the new process and with no guarantee of success.

Chief executive Simon Parkinson said the plans would mean fewer lessons in the community, which would be ""devastating for about 1,600 learners right across the region"".

""We can do everything from community learning, textiles, history, arts courses and technical skills to help people looking for employment,"" he said.

""That flexibility and scale we can bring to it will be lost.""

Among those fighting to save a weekly craft class in Horden, County Durham, is retired administrator Cheryl Robson.

""It gets people talking, those people who sometimes don't have any company during the week,"" she said.

Grandmother Anne Glaister, who was crocheting children's toys in Horden, called the decision ""disgusting"" and points to the numbers who attend evening classes in the former pit village.

Staff and learners in South Shields are also unhappy at the threat hanging over WEA lessons.

There is a new proposal to get New York State to pay 100% of the costs of school busing in school districts in which 25% of the students attend private school. The proposed law was introduced by State Sen. Bill Weber and Assemblyman Karl Brabenec, who was my opponent on the 2022 election for state assembly for the 98th Assembly District. It clearly is a bald-faced attempt to cut or freeze property taxes for East Ramapo residents. No such plan was offered for any of the other districts in Rockland County.

None of us should be fooled into thinking this would improve public education in East Ramapo in any way. Not even taxpayers would be helped in any significant way. Voters and taxpayers should note that the proposal it would merely transfer the cost of busing costs from the local district to the state and does not include any directive of how these savings could be used. Can they be used for tax cuts or multiple year tax freezes? There is no mandate that they can't be used for these purpose.

Most important to me, the public school students, including those of East Ramapo, are not guaranteed to benefit by these savings. Will we once again see advanced placement courses offered to the public school students of East Ramapo as occurs in every other school district in New York State? No, because the school board will direct that the savings be used to cut taxes instead of to support the kids of East Ramapo.

This legislation has virtually no chance of passage in the New York State Legislature but it make us feel good and makes us admire our two GOP State Legislators who will campaign on the bill.

I offer instead a real proposal that would have the potential to help all school districts in our county or in any other county and would, if adopted at the county level, guarantee that the public school students of East Ramapo and those of other similarly situated school districts across New York State would once again be getting the kinds of educational upgrades that are taken for granted in school districts across the State. All school districts would get their share of the additional funds.

Permissive legislation could be passed that permits counties to adopt an extra sales tax from ¼ % to 1% in ¼% increments as determined by the each county legislature with all of the money to be transferred directly to the school districts proportionally, based on the school aged population of each district. This would mean a bump for school districts like East Ramapo.

There would be a mandate that there be maintenance of effort on the tax side, meaning that no school district could take this money and cut the revenue in the first year of funding or a later year's property taxes using extra or saved revenue from the new tax (but property taxes could be flattened, in the discretion of each school board). The use of the additional funds can be determined by each school board in Rockland but the use is limited to benefit of the public school children within their district. As sales tax usually grows every year, the real value of a districts funds can be maintained or even go up.

Lastly, in districts with a state-appointed monitor, the monitor would determine the use of the funds for that district, not the school board.

In our current system of annual votes on budgets that must be put forth by the school board and voted on by local residents, this would create a regular, reliable source to funds to ensure educational equity in Rockland County, no matter how the population of a district changes over time.

Instead of gimmicky proposals like that from Weber and Brabenec, my plan would provide a continuous and fair use of local tax dollars that will improve the education of every child in Rockland County and, perhaps in part, stabilize school property taxes for all of us.

In a video interview with PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the WEF said India has been one of the best-performing markets in the world and investors have made money here.

Blake also struck a word of caution saying that since markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and were prone to ""ups and downs"", there was a need to educate investors.

""So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),"" he said.

""I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,"" he said.

Blake said a survey of fintech CEOs by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had revealed that 70 per cent of the firms considered AI as a major force and could be deployed for personalisation and customisation of products and services.

Blake said for sectoral regulators, AI could be helpful in the context of risk management and there was a need for them to adapt to the rapid changes in technology.

""The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,"" he said.

Blake said in the Asia-Pacific region, the regulatory agencies were generally viewed as being quite skillful.

""When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,"" he said.

""One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,"" Blake said.

""It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set. That is a rather large challenge, but it's something that we as a team are looking at currently and trying to devote some time to,"" Blake said.

The WEF-Cambridge report on 'The Future of Global Fintech: Towards Resilient and Inclusive Growth', released in January, found that the majority of financial technology companies hold a positive view of their regulatory environment, with 63 per cent rating it as adequate.

Here's how the company has positioned itself to take advantage of this veritable windfall.

There's been a great deal of buzz over the past year or so about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). The consensus is that these recent advances are groundbreaking and will increase human productivity severalfold by automating a growing number of otherwise time-consuming tasks. As businesses scramble to profit from these advances, some fear the market has entered an AI bubble.

Arm Holdings (ARM 0.41%) CEO Rene Haas leaves no doubt about which camp he falls in. ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle,"" he opined. ""We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.""

While it might seem like hyperbole, many in technology circles are adopting that view. Estimates run the gamut, but the potential economic impact could be immense. Generative AI is estimated to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies on the bleeding edge of this secular tailwind could end up reaping a veritable windfall.

It's no coincidence that Arm Holdings is one of these companies and has positioned itself to profit from the AI revolution.

To understand Arm's place in the vast AI ecosystem, it helps to know a bit about the company's strategy. Arm Holdings was founded in 1990, intent on changing the computing industry. After a product failure in 1993, the company changed its business model. Arm began developing and licensing chip designs rather than the chips themselves, and its pivot to intellectual property (IP) was complete.

Over the next two decades, Arm became a force in the semiconductor industry, creating and licensing blueprints for some of the world's most widely used chips. The company's expertise can be found in a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and smart TVs. In fact, Arm estimates that its processors are used by 70% of the world's population. The key here is that its AI-centric designs are prolific in cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.

Because Arm creates and licenses its processor designs, it achieves significant economies of scale and can do so at a much lower cost than most companies could achieve on their own.

If Nvidia is the king of AI, Arm Holdings is arguably the queen.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for training and running AI models. What does this have to do with Arm? The company's high-end central processing units (CPUs) play a key role in AI processing. For example, Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip -- which integrates accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet the computational demands of AI -- uses 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores.

It isn't just Nvidia that's dependent on Arm's newest processor. Microsoft's new AI-centric server chips contain more than 100 of them. In a recent interview, Haas pointed out that many customers are switching to the V9. Not only does this core offer greater processing power, but it comes at twice the royalty rate of its forerunner -- which will be a boon to Arm.

The secular tailwind of AI is beginning to show up in Arm's results. For the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Arm generated record revenue that grew 14% year over year to $824 million, fueled by license revenue that jumped 18%, and record royalty revenue that increased 11%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, an increase of 32%. But that only tells part of the story.

Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet shown up in revenue -- climbed to $2.43 billion, up 38% year over year. This suggests that its revenue growth will likely continue to accelerate.

Management's forecast seems to support that assertion. In the fourth quarter, Arm's outlook calls for revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, representing growth of between 34% and 42% -- more than double its 14% growth in the third quarter.

To kick off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, Nvidia debuted its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, which takes AI processing to the next level. The Blackwell GB200 superchip contains two B200 GPUs and one Arm-based Grace CPU. While specific details are still sparse, this will undoubtedly cement Arm's place in the AI revolution.

For investors who depend on the most common valuation metrics, Arm can be tricky. The stock currently trades for 109 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales. However, these metrics fail to consider Arm's significant growth trajectory. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in this growth -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.

Given Arm's decades of expertise, its ubiquitous chip blueprints, and the accelerating demand for AI, Arm could represent a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity.",fool.com,news,The Motley Fool,Danny Vena,0.223529411764706,448968350,1,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/770046/a-circuit-board-with-ai-cpu-branded-on-the-processor.jpg,

Officers at Norfolk County Council will now work with their counterparts in district councils to decide where the chargers should go.

But rural areas, where private companies might be reluctant to install the technology, are likely to be the main beneficiaries from the £7.1m boost, which comes from the government's Local Electric Vehicle (LEVI) fund.

More electric car charging points will be installed in Norfolk

The majority of the charging points will produce less than 22kW, meaning they are most likely to be installed in residential streets, so people can use them to power up their vehicles overnight.

But council bosses said some of them could be more powerful, rapid chargers and some could be specifically for taxis.

Graham Plant, cabinet member for highways, infrastructure and transport said: ""Reducing carbon emissions is at the forefront of Norfolk County Council's plans and we recognise the important role that electric vehicles play in this.

""Confirmation of this money from the DfT comes at a great time for us as we finish rolling out on-street charge points across Norwich and now start to focus on rolling out a similar project across all other districts in Norfolk.

""We'll use this money to get charging infrastructure into areas that are less commercially viable, such as our more rural locations that wouldn't otherwise be picked up by charge point operators - ensuring we make our whole county fit for the future.""

The council, which has been installing charging points on dozens of Norwich streets, said when proposals are drawn up, they will be shared with the public and consulted on if necessary.

The boost comes just days after council leaders revealed they could be prepared to make land the authority owns available to private companies to install chargers.

Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in India this fiscal has seen steady growth in debt investment in sharp contrast to the volatile equity investment, V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward.

Nagmanjunath, CEO, PakkaProfile, said, ""Hiring gig workers has been a bit of a black box. Employers are constantly looking for higher productivity, longer retention, and better customer service from their workforce. And gig workers are typically opportunistic, trying to maximise their earnings over a short period of time, looking at flexible hours and opportunities closer to home. The opportunity lies in bridging the gap. Moving away from traditional job sites to an on-demand platform for gig jobs is what we have to offer.""

""Vernacular games are an effective way to build a profile by measuring personality traits, cognitive and language skills of the workforce and help match the right people for jobs,"" he added.

Bhargavi V, Partner at Java Capital, said,

""PakkaProfile has a unique approach of using games, breaking all barriers of language and education levels to assess and match gig workforce to the right job. It also builds a skill profile for each candidate evaluated through the platform, which opens numerous possibilities in the future.""

""PakkaProfile provides flexibility to employers by offering them to opt for either the evaluation+matching+ hiring platform or just the evaluation+matching solution, which helped them to work with giants like Swiggy and Ola at a very early stage in their journey,"" Bhargavi added.

Protests have been held in Durham and Tyneside after the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) was told it will lose its £1.3m annual grant.

But the incoming North East Mayoral Combined Authority (NEMCA) insists WEA and others will be able to compete for new contracts in the summer.

The charity warns the move risks dozens of courses and the jobs of 72 tutors.

In a statement, NEMCA said adult education providers, including the WEA, would be able to secure contracts through a competitive process.

""In addition to this our local FE colleges and local authorities will receive grant funding for Adult Education activity because of the significant volume of provision they deliver,"" it said.

But WEA warned it will be bidding for a smaller pot of money under the new process and with no guarantee of success.

Chief executive Simon Parkinson said the plans would mean fewer lessons in the community, which would be ""devastating for about 1,600 learners right across the region"".

""We can do everything from community learning, textiles, history, arts courses and technical skills to help people looking for employment,"" he said.

""That flexibility and scale we can bring to it will be lost.""

Among those fighting to save a weekly craft class in Horden, County Durham, is retired administrator Cheryl Robson.

""It gets people talking, those people who sometimes don't have any company during the week,"" she said.

Grandmother Anne Glaister, who was crocheting children's toys in Horden, called the decision ""disgusting"" and points to the numbers who attend evening classes in the former pit village.

Staff and learners in South Shields are also unhappy at the threat hanging over WEA lessons.

In a video interview with PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the WEF said India has been one of the best-performing markets in the world and investors have made money here.

Blake also struck a word of caution saying that since markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and were prone to ""ups and downs"", there was a need to educate investors.

""So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),"" he said.

""I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,"" he said.

Blake said a survey of fintech CEOs by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had revealed that 70 per cent of the firms considered AI as a major force and could be deployed for personalisation and customisation of products and services.

Blake said for sectoral regulators, AI could be helpful in the context of risk management and there was a need for them to adapt to the rapid changes in technology.

""The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,"" he said.

Blake said in the Asia-Pacific region, the regulatory agencies were generally viewed as being quite skillful.

""When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,"" he said.

""One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,"" Blake said.

""It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set.

The state of Georgia will receive federal funding totaling $207 million for 74 projects across the state after advocacy from Senator Raphael Warnock, according to a news release on the senator's website.

Warnock helped secure $2.5 million for Providence Pointe, the low-income senior rental phase of Elliott's Walk in south Columbus, according to information provided by Warnock's team.

Warnock told the Ledger-Enquirer that growing up in south Georgia he saw firsthand the challenges of securing affordable housing.

""My parents worked very hard every single day and still they couldn't afford a home until years after I left for college and grad school,"" said Warnock. ""When I look at what's going on in Columbus, I saw a particular need.""

Warnock said he ""leaned in"" on funding for Columbus.

""I was struck by the fact that there had been no housing developments built in south Columbus in over 50 years, "" Warnock said. ""That's an area that has been sorely neglected.""

Warnock said regarding the funding, ""It meets a need and I'm glad we were able to respond.""

""I've been focused on housing since my earliest days in the senate, and I will remain focused on housing,"" Warnock said.

""Housing is dignity, it's security, and it's prosperity,"" he later said.

Warnock told the Ledger-Enquirer that he reintroduced the ""Downpayment Toward Equity Act"" last week that would help provide support for would-be first-generation homeowners, according to the senator.

During a March 11 interview on MSNBC ""Squawk Box,"" Trump was asked about dealing with the solvency problems confronting beloved Medicare and Social Security programs. ""There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,"" Trump said.

Trump has long distanced himself from Republicans who for more than a decade have called for serious cuts to Social Security and other social programs.

His campaign quickly backpedaled, saying Trump was talking about cutting waste and fraud. He later told ultra-conservative Breitbart News: ""I will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare.""

He didn't offer specifics in any of the interviews. But then neither do most politicians. For years, candidates need only say they support Social Security and Medicare, and that's good enough to keep voters, particularly older ones, from voting against them to protect their entitlements.

President Joe Biden saw an opportunity in Trump's unforced error and didn't want to leave it unexploited. ""Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security and Medicare back on the chopping block again,"" he told a New Hampshire campaign crowd on March 11. ""If anyone tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age again, I will stop them. Working people built this country.""

Biden's campaign then cut a commercial.

""A pox on both their houses,"" U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, said last week. He is one of the few lawmakers on Capitol Hill pursuing an actual solution to shore up the fund, which pays an average of $1,800 per month in Social Security benefits.

The trust funds that pay Medicare's medical and hospitals benefits for the elderly and disabled has enough money to remain solvent until 2028. Social Security has until 2033. That doesn't mean the programs will close their doors when the bucks run out. But the law requires dramatic cuts in benefits, such as a 24% reduction in monthly Social Security payments. The reductions would annually cost about $17,400 for the average retired couple, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The legislative choices are unsavory: increasing taxes, raising the retirement age, reducing cost-of-living adjustments. As a result, multiple Congresses and administrations have been content to kick that can down the road.

Cassidy, who is working with Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, proposes the federal government direct about $1.5 trillion, most of the money coming from loans, to invest in stocks, bonds, and other private financial instruments, with the proceeds going to the fund that pays Social Security benefits. Cassidy notes that many employee pension plans do just the same thing.

Biden has floated taxing wages that total more than $400,000 annually. Currently, workers pay toward Social Security on their yearly wages up to $168,600 -- then nothing after that. Biden's plan would only tax those making more than $400,000.

Meanwhile, the House Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus among the 218-member GOP House majority, weighed in Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, and his No. 2, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, have both chaired the RSC and could have blocked the release of the report. They did not.

The caucus called for raising the retirement age before beneficiaries could start collecting Social Security. The group also endorsed a semi-privatization scheme to provide vouchers to Medicare beneficiaries with subsidies for premiums.

None of these plans have been officially presented to Congress, which would have to approve any changes to the entitlement programs.

But the Trump-Biden hubbub -- as filled with innuendo and exaggeration as it is -- Cassidy notes, marks the first time that the issue has risen in a national campaign. That's the first step toward a debate over specifics that leads to votes. It's an advance that Cassidy says he has long sought, though nothing concrete has yet been recommended by the presidential candidates.

""I don't think either candidate has a viable plan, and because of that there will be a 24% cut to current and future beneficiaries under current law,"" he said.

But rural areas, where private companies might be reluctant to install the technology, are likely to be the main beneficiaries from the £7.1m boost, which comes from the government's Local Electric Vehicle (LEVI) fund.

More electric car charging points will be installed in Norfolk

The majority of the charging points will produce less than 22kW, meaning they are most likely to be installed in residential streets, so people can use them to power up their vehicles overnight.

But council bosses said some of them could be more powerful, rapid chargers and some could be specifically for taxis.

Graham Plant, cabinet member for highways, infrastructure and transport said: ""Reducing carbon emissions is at the forefront of Norfolk County Council's plans and we recognise the important role that electric vehicles play in this.

""Confirmation of this money from the DfT comes at a great time for us as we finish rolling out on-street charge points across Norwich and now start to focus on rolling out a similar project across all other districts in Norfolk.

""We'll use this money to get charging infrastructure into areas that are less commercially viable, such as our more rural locations that wouldn't otherwise be picked up by charge point operators - ensuring we make our whole county fit for the future.""

The council, which has been installing charging points on dozens of Norwich streets, said when proposals are drawn up, they will be shared with the public and consulted on if necessary.

The boost comes just days after council leaders revealed they could be prepared to make land the authority owns available to private companies to install chargers.

""To facilitate this relief effort, the funds will be drawn from a variety of sources including the 2024 Budget, Connect PNG, the District Services Improvement Programme (DSIP), and the Provincial Services Improvement Programme (PSIP), disaster funds and support from development partners"" Prime Minister Marape said.

""The Office of the Chief Secretary understands the enormity of the situation and is coordinating a whole of government approach through a National Disaster Steering Committee to assess and coordinate with the help of National Disaster Office and provincial disaster offices for special interventions.

""This financial mobilisation is aimed at ensuring that the support reaches the communities most in need without delay and restoration is made to areas affected.

""I call on districts and provinces directly affected by these natural disasters to expedite the

process of accessing their allocated DSIP and PSIP funds. This proactive measure is intended to enhance the efficiency of the relief distribution process, ensuring that the funding support not only reaches all affected areas but does so in a timely manner.""

To ensure funds are immediately available, the Prime Minister has directed Finance Minister Rainbo Paita, to facilitate the immediate drawdown of DSIP and PSIP funds plus infrastructure funds that are in the 2024 budget.

Further financial instruction has been made to ensure the use of service improvement funds to address disaster relief.

""Papua New Guinea, has been recently hit hard by earthquake, flooding caused by heavy rain and ensuing landslips, king tides, strong winds and others,"" Prime Minister Marape stated.

""This includes this morning's earthquake in East Sepik and parts of Madang provinces where assessments are currently being carried out in partnership with provincial and local authorities.

""I commend the work done by Department of Works and Highways in opening up the Highlands and Ramu highways.""

The fund's primary goal is to promote the development of TradeTech solutions and support the expansion of startups and venture projects based on digital technology initiatives and the tokenisation of tangible assets.

The announcement aligns with Investopia's vision to inspire entrepreneurs to expand into new economic sectors by offering the necessary tools and opportunities to foster the growth and prosperity of their innovative projects.

The fund, introduced in partnership with TLIP, a specialised digital platform for trade data storage and exchange, aims to enhance the trade technology landscape and foster a more interconnected, efficient, and accessible global trade system.

These investments are a step forward to redefining the digital trade and finance landscape. By fostering a supportive ecosystem for technological innovation, IOTA will have the opportunity to unlock new possibilities and opportunities for seamless and efficient global trade, benefiting societies and economies around the globe.

Investopia 2024 played a crucial role in facilitating the launch of the new investment fund, offering an ideal platform to showcase IOTA's innovative solutions to the global community of investors and decision-makers.

The announcement aligns with the UAE's commitment to enhancing its trade technology and digital solutions, solidifying its position as a global hub for technology and innovation.

Will 2024 turn out to be better for Israel's technology sector than last year? Alongside extensive layoffs, there is also talk of recovery. Indicative of that is that crowdfunding platform OurCrowd has announced that it is expanding its investment commitments in its Israel Resilience Fund from eight startups to thirty-four.

The ventures in question are from a broad range of sectors, among them agritech, fintech, health services, enterprise hardware and software, and artificial intelligence. What they have in common is that they have been affected one way or another by the war. Some have had to evacuate their offices, some have employees doing reserve duty with the IDF, some have seen their funding affected, and some are assisting in the war effort.

In order to obtain funding, a company has to demonstrate that it received previous funding of at least $1 million; that its product meets a market need; and that after the funding it will have enough cash for at least nine months. The Israel Resilience Fund will provide up to 50% of an investment round in companies that meet these criteria.

Portfolio companies will also receive business support from PwC Israel. Among other things, this will consist of assistance in business development and in raising funds in Israel and overseas, connections with a pool of finance executives who have committed themselves to helping the companies, dedicated mentoring services, and more.

""OurCrowd is waiving all management fees and carried interest, in a move which will further strengthen investors' financial return,"" says OurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved. ""The fund meets a critical need of the market, in that it creates an incentive to invest in the runway extension that companies need. It turns out that, on average, investments in the fund leveraged eight dollars for every dollar invested, so that, altogether, more than $100 million have been invested in the past few weeks.

""This success inspired our investors to keep moving forward, and we hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to widen the circle of activity. What chiefly concerns startups at present is the need to find a lead investor who is ready to stand up and say 'I'm investing in this company now, and not waiting for the war to end and for the situation to become clear.' The high-tech industry needs investors with courage.""

Medved founded the OurCrowd platform in 2013 to make venture capital investment accessible to the general public. The platform's investment commitments amount to some $2.3 billion, and it has invested in 440 companies and 56 investment funds, and posted 63 exits, besides several flotations.",en.globes.co.il,news,Globes,,0.0117647058823529,448966407,1,https://res.cloudinary.com/globes/image/upload/t_800X392/v1703082752/direct/ourcrowd_tl6rlo.jpg,

Among these, the Ethereum presale of 2014 stands out as a landmark event. A select group of investors gained early access to Ether tokens at a discounted rate of $0.31 per ETH. Imagine how lucky these savvy investors were to snatch up this undervalued crypto gem and turn their modest investments into fortunes.

The crypto market is notorious for high volatility, but presale projects stand out as a beacon of predictability, as their price is pinned to a certain level until they get listed on a DEX. So, they are immune to market fluctuations.

The second reason is the low price. As in the Ethereum example above, its presale price was exponentially lower than its post-listing price. Similarly, most emerging projects aim to raise some capital, so they try to attract investors with highly favorable offers.

A myriad of emerging projects are vying for investors' attention. The competition is fierce, but certain contenders with a strong concept and high utility clearly stand out. Unlike many junk tokens, such as meme coins, whose value is based solely on the hype around them, the projects with real practical use have a more solid foundation.

BlastUP is the first launchpad on the Blast blockchain, a unique Layer 2 solution offering a native yield of 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. This groundbreaking approach has made Blast quite popular, and it has already attracted a huge army of fans, hitting a $1 billion in TLV in just one month. Moreover, the recent launch of the Blast Mainnet has pushed it to the top 10 projects in terms of TLV. Being a part of such a robust ecosystem, BlastUP is already ticking the boxes for its reliability.

The presale of BlastUP tokens ($BLP) is currently running, and buying them now could be compared with investing in ETH during its presale. The current BLP value is pinned at merely 5 US cents, while its listing price is set at $0.1, which already makes a 50% ROI.

Hop on the bandwagon! Hurry to join BlastUP

Those who buy BlastUP tokens at the presale stage get access to exclusive early benefits including participation in an Airdrop to get free $BLP tokens. The utility of BlastUP tokens spreads far and wide, offering its users access to:

Moreover, $BLP holders get Booster Points, special tokens that BlastUP is launching to support the community. Booster Point is a fuel for the Community Incentives Program (CIP) intended for the creation of a solid base for launching projects and making them successful.

In just one month, BlastUP has attracted over $2.5 million in investments, which speaks much for its wide recognition. The presale runs until the end of May, so it's not too late to buy a possible crypto gem at the best price.

Don't miss out! Secure your BlastUP tokens today at the most competitive price!

As a committed participant within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP plays an integral role in fostering mutual growth and progress. Recently, it has established strategic alliances with other esteemed members of the Blast family, marking a significant milestone - the highly anticipated launch of the Blast Mainnet.

The partnerships with Blast Alpha, Blastopedia, and Blast Ecosystem not only emphasize BlastUP's dedication to community development but also showcase its commitment to delivering captivating experiences for its users through entertaining contests. These recent collaborations have the potential to enhance the visibility and reputation of BlastUP.

BlastUP is more than a sound investment opportunity; it is a catalyst for creating a rewarding environment for DApp launches. Embracing a motto ""Grow faster, earn more,"" BlastUP is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the success of blockchain startups. Central to its strategy is the Launchpad Accelerator crafted to provide startup teams with comprehensive documentation and refined tokenomics, thereby smoothing the path for effective capital raising.

At the core of BlastUP's ethos is an uncompromising focus on security. Through its rigorous Project Screening, the platform ensures admission is reserved exclusively for the most trustworthy projects, thus safeguarding the integrity of its entire ecosystem. This commitment to security cements BlastUP's reputation as the premier destination for those seeking dependability.

Moving forward, BlastUP is set to revolutionize startup launches on the Blast network by leveraging AI and Web3 technologies. Its 2026 strategic roadmap reveals ambitious plans, such as an AI-enhanced IDO screener, dedicated tools for AI-enabled startup teams, and the launch of an interactive Community Marketplace. This firm commitment highlights BlastUP's focus on advancing its ecosystem's potential and leading the way in blockchain innovation.

The volatile yet lucrative landscape of cryptocurrency investments presents notable opportunities akin to the storied Ethereum presale of 2014. In this context, BlastUP stands out as an investment of note, offering potential gains through its ongoing $BLP token presale.

BlastUP is not just another crypto project, it stands as a harbinger of progressive blockchain utility and investment value. Within the burgeoning Blast ecosystem, BlastUP's strategic position is unmistakable. Investors aligning with BlastUP are investing in a vision that champions technological innovation, community synergy, and sustained growth, heralding a new chapter in blockchain evolution poised for success.",analyticsinsight.net,news,Analytics Insight,,0.2313725490196079,448966283,1,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Frontier-1024x585.png,

With cruise operators set to start contributing to the European Union's emissions trading program, the global Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, wants ""countries to be able to reinvest all, or at least some, of this extra revenue into infrastructure,"" Europe Director General Marie-Caroline Laurent said in an interview.

The sums are not inconsiderable.

Europe's cruise sector is slated to contribute more than $655 million to the emissions program, known as ETS, starting in 2026, Laurent said.

But at least part of that total would be better used if it were redeployed toward clean infrastructure for the industry -- in areas from reduced emissions at berth and at sea, to programs for sustainable facilities at destination ports, Laurent said.

Infrastructure is a ""key concern,"" Laurent said, as electrification of ports and refueling facilities will be essential for the industry's future.

Few industries have faced a tougher post-pandemic challenge than cruise lines. Even after a sharp rally last year, shares have yet to snap back to pre-pandemic highs. Non-fuel costs -- fleet maintenance, food and onboard services -- are also expected to rise in coming quarters.

Currently about half of the industry's vessels are set up for next-generation shore-side electricity, Laurent said. That puts the onus on ports to update facilities.

""We obviously need the ports to be equipped with the newest outlets and to have electrification capability,"" she said.

For a possible model, Laurent pointed to the aviation sector, where sustainable SAF fuel is rated zero-emission and doesn't count toward emissions calculations.

For cruise operators, ""this kind of mechanism would be a good way to accelerate the deployment of alternative fuels,"" Laurent said.",arkansasonline.com,news,ArkansasOnline,,0.07450980392156858,448965990,1,https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/206809042_cruise_3FGRN77AVVHWPMDIRUOQO7M4X4_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676,

Kishida will hear from former education ministers Ryu Shionoya and Hakubun Shimomura; former economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura; and Hiroshige Seko, a former secretary general for the LDP in the House of Councillors. All four were executives of the Abe faction, an intraparty group led by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that has been criticized for alleged violations of the Political Funds Control Law.

The LDP is considering either not endorsing the four members in elections, or imposing harsher penalties, for their significant involvement in kickbacks from the Abe faction's fundraising party income.

By taking the initiative to personally question them, Kishida is apparently seeking to clarify what happened with this habitual misconduct and to directly denounce their responsibility as former executives of the faction. The LDP plans to begin the hearings as early as Tuesday and to decide on punishments for the four, and other party members, in the first week of April.

LDP Secretary General Toshimitsu Motegi and General Council Chairman Hiroshi Moriyama will also attend the hearings. Based on their findings, the party will hold a meeting of its Ethics Committee to formally decide on the punishment. Kishida plans to hold a press conference following the decision and explain the details such as the reasons for the penalities.

""Some aspects are still unclear, and more effort is needed to confirm them,"" Motegi told reporters during a visit to Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture, on Saturday. ""We want to reach a conclusion as soon as possible about what political responsibility should be taken and how the matter should be resolved.""

In February, the LDP interviewed 82 member lawmakers, including the four Kishida will speak with, who did not accurately report kickbacks in their political fund reports. A team led by Moriyama was present, as were lawyers.

The interviews with the four are expected to ask again about the content of talks held in August 2022 following the death of then faction leader Abe, and to question them about their awareness of their own political responsibility.

Abe is believed to have ordered the four to stop the faction's payment of kickbacks in April 2022, when Shionoya and Shimomura were deputy chairmen of the faction, Nishimura was its secretary general, and Seko was chairman of the Abe faction in the upper house.

Abe died in July 2022. The four discussed how to deal with kickbacks in the following month but did not decide to stop them. The party leadership believes that the four bear a particularly heavy political and moral responsibility for not actively working to stop the practice.",japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,news,japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,,-0.0980392156862745,448965710,1,https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/★hearings.jpg,

Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.

A new assessment of the perks of share ownerships has identified a number eye-opening rewards of recent times that have sweetened the deal.

Not all are still available, however the details demonstrate that it is worth investigating just what, if any, perks are offered to private shareholders.

The research found options have ranged from the 'nice to have' such as free breakfasts and luxury chocolate to genuine savings with discounts on cars and cruises.

The details have been compiled by courier and transport exports Parcelhero, which offers substantial discounts on its services to investors.

Its Head of Consumer Research, David Jinks, said: ""The main reason individuals and investment companies buy stocks or put money directly into companies is to make money through capital gains or dividends. However, a number of companies offer other inducements that certainly help gain attention.

""Indeed, a wealthy investor could wake up to a free hotel breakfast, climb into their hugely discounted new car, shop for significantly discounted new clothes and end their day by eating free luxury chocolates while reading a heavily discounted book or, perhaps, take off on a cruise with free onboard credit.""

Parcelhero compiled a round-up of some of the very best and most eye-opening investors' incentives of recent times.

Importantly, not all are still available and not all the companies are listed on the UK stock market, but Mr Jinks said: ""They give a good idea of the potential perks that await investors, angels and the more materialistic alike.""

Whitbread:

Whitbread no longer brews beer but, instead, owns a number of hospitality businesses, offering qualifying shareholders free breakfasts in Premier Inns. It also offered a 10 percent discount on its restaurants for people with a shareholder benefit card.

Ford:

In the US at least, qualifying shareholders could participate in Ford's ""Friends & Neighbors"" Special Vehicle Pricing Privilege scheme.

New vehicles could be purchased for just 4 percent above employee pricing. Potentially, that was a deal worth thousands of dollars to its stockholders.

Next:

The fashion chain Next has offered its qualifying stockholders a 25 percent discount against one purchase once a year.

Lindt:

The luxury chocolate maker Lindt & Sprüngli AG gave a gift box to qualifying shareholders who voted during its annual meeting in Switzerland.

Bloomsbury:

The publishers behind the Harry Potter series offered its qualifying shareholders a 35 percent discount on its books.

Associated British Foods:

ABF delivered a mystery offer for qualifying ABF shareholders who attended its AGM. They received a free gift worth around £30.

Cruises:

Carnival Cruise Line, which owns companies such as Holland America Line and Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean all kept their qualifying investors buoyant by offering onboard credit of between $50 and $250, depending on the length of their cruise.

Brewers:

A number of breweries - Fullers, Mitchells & Butlers, Shepherd Neame and Youngs - have all offered qualifying shareholders various discounts on drinks and food - and accommodation where applicable. Until the mid-1980s, Youngs also offered a free lunch with unlimited drinks to its shareholders.

Parcelhero:

The firm has an attractive investors' rewards scheme for individuals and organisations backing its equity funding campaign on Floww, the respected fundraising and investment platform.

These range from 15 percent off its services for 12 months for investments of £2,500 to £24,999 through to 25 percent for investments of over £75,000.

The major challenge to be met is the limited energy storage capacity of the battery pack: both the amount of energy which can be stored within the space available in the vehicle (defining its range), and the aging of the individual battery cells (determining how long a whole pack can deliver sufficient energy and power to drive the vehicle). This thesis aims to increase our knowledge and understanding of structural changes induced by aging and usage of the Li-ion battery materials involved.Aging processes have been studied in commercial-size Li-ion cells with two different chemistries. LiFePO4/graphite cells were aged under different conditions, and thereafter examined at different points along the electrodes by post mortem characterisation using SEM, XPS, XRD and electrochemical characterization in half-cells. The results revealed large differences in degradation behaviour under different aging conditions and in different regions of the same cell. The aging of LiMn2O4-LiCoO2/Li4Ti5O12 cells was studied under two different aging conditions. Post mortem analysis revealed a high degree of Mn/Co mixing within individual particles of the LiMn2O4-LiCoO2 composite electrode.Structural changes induced by lithium insertion were studied in two negative electrode materials: in Li0.5Ni0.25TiOPO4 using in situ XRD, and in Ni0.5TiOPO4 using EXAFS, XANES and HAXPES. It was shown that Li0.5Ni0.25TiOPO4 lost most of its long-range-order during lithiation, and that both Ni and Ti were involved in the charge compensation mechanism during lithiation/delithiation of Ni0.5TiOPO4, with small clusters of metal-like Ni forming during lithiation.Finally, in situ XRD studies were also made of the reaction pathways to form LiFeSO4F from two sets of reactants: either FeSO4·H2O and LiF, or Li2SO4 and FeF2. During the heat treatment, Li2SO4 and FeF2 react to form FeSO4·H2O and LiF in a first step. In a second step LiFeSO4F is formed. This underlines the importance of the structural similarities between LiFeSO4F and FeSO4·H2O in the formation process of LiFeSO4F.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.0117647058823529,448965312,1,,

The Minister, said sectorial linkage has been identified as missing in creating a holistic approach to drive industrialization in the country.

She highlighted this at the weekend during her official visit to one of the country's largest indigenous steel manufacturing Company, KAM STEEL INTEGRATED COMPANY LIMITED, Located at Holiness Highway, Igbafa Village, Sagamu, Ogun State.

Kam Steel Integrated Company Limited is a wholly owned indigenous integrated steel company in Nigeria having capabilities in contributing to the sector and economy of the country.

The visit of the Minister is in line with the agenda of Mr. President His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu(GCFR), to reposition the economic growth through industrialization that will help in job creation, infrastructures, stable power etc.

During the visit, Minister expressed her satisfaction with the state of the art infrastructure at KAMSTEEL and commended Ultra Modern Production capabilities of the Company.

She equally noted the desire of the Federal Government to revamp the nation's steel sector to enhance the economy as well as create employment opportunities.

The Minister stated that the country's abundant mineral resources hold the key to reshaping the nation's economic landscape and extending the benefits of democracy to every Nigerian.

By tapping into the latent potential of the steel sector and channeling it into lucrative ventures, we can ensure that the dividends of democracy reach every citizen.

""The steel sector stands as a pivotal pillar of Nigeria's industrial growth, carrying the potential to provide substantial job opportunities for the youth.

""To realise this vision, the government is fully dedicated to implementing an extensive array of measures designed to attract reputable international investors,"" she said.

Dr. Doris, reiterated her determination to boost Nigeria's economy through aggressive industrialisation and robust investment regime.

""It's time to set Nigeria on the path of greatness through industrialisation and investment,"" Dr. Uzoka-Anite said.

The Minister further promised to consolidate on the mandate of President Tinubu in improving the economy by creating more investment and jobs for Nigerians.

She also harped on the readiness to rebrand Nigeria to the outside world to pull and attract more foreign direct investment and also make the country an investment hub for prospective investors, fostering the ease of doing business across the country.

In his remarks, Group Managing Director/CEO of KAM HOLDING, Dr. Yusuf Kamoru (MON), thanked the Minister for the visit and assured that the company is striving to sustain operations despite the economic headwinds and other critical challenges being faced by the sector.

Dr. Yusuf said, ""As we all know that steel industry is one of the major bedrocks to developing a Nation and this official visit makes the clarity to know that Company has demonstrated that it has the capabilities and expertise to produce steel products of best quality that can be used for high rise Buildings, construction of Bridges, Roads, heavy structures etc. that withstands any international quality test"" he said.

Investment Analysis","WIF has been tipped to get back into the $3 mark after pulling back to $2.3.

With the continuous evolution of the crypto market, a new wave of meme coins are emerging with Book of Meme (BOME), DogWifHat (WIF), and PEPE appearing as formidable contenders. Interestingly, their popularity and interest among the crypto community position them as top challengers of the long-reigning favorites - Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

Having taken note of these emerging meme coins, whales have doubled down their activities as they ""flood"" exchanges with their transfers.

BOME's uniqueness lies in its 50 billion circulating supply that could easily line it up to hit $1. In the last 90 days, this meme coin has surged by 1,468% to trade at $0.01424. According to reports, BOME is currently in a recovery phase, bouncing from a crucial Fibonacci retracement to testing a bull run. Following a previous impressive run, BOME took a significant pullback from its $0.02805 all-time high.

Analysts have observed that this asset is crossing the halfway retracement level, a run that could take it to $0.30. Also, a surge in buying pressure is reportedly positioning it to challenge its 38.20% Fib level. This uptrend would enable BOME to reclaim the physiological level of $0.015. Interestingly, the sudden surge in trading volume is reportedly in support of the ongoing rally.

BOME is currently trailing WIF, one of the fastest-rising meme coins. As of press time, WIF was the fourth largest meme coin with a market cap of $2.3 billion, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE.

Last month, it surged by almost 700% before it got trapped in the broad market ""bloodbath."" On March 18, WIF became the third-largest meme coin after surpassing PEPE, however, this feat was short-lived. Within the moment, WIF briefly hit $3 before declining to the current value of $2.3. According to CoinCodex, WIF would hit $3.38 before the end of March 2024.

Based on these Dogwifhat projections, WIF will be changing hands at $3.38 on March 26, 2024, gaining 47.59% in the process.

It is important to note that the current level was rightly predicted by an analyst identified as Bluntz and reported by Crypto News Flash. At that time, WIF was trading at $0.361886. Bluntz has always been a big fan of the Elliott Wave theory which mostly focuses on recurrent long-term price patterns. As reported, Bluntz noticed that WIF was on the second wave of the five-wave pattern, and also predicted that the asset could surge by 270% to hit $1. It is important to note that the meme coin surged by 323% from $0.0759 on January 8 to $0.361886 on January 26. After that incredible surge, WIF has never looked back.

One of the most talked-about meme coins is PEPE. In the last 30 days, PEPE has surged by 540%, recording $0.00001074 within the period. However, the asset took a sudden nosedive to fall to the current price of $0.00000758. Interestingly, it is expected to reach its all-time high in the next bull cycle.

Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development and the Pacific, on Sunday announced 17 million Australian dollars (11 million U.S. dollars) in funding for the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis -- also known as the TB Alliance.

The funding will support the TB Alliance's efforts to develop and trial a new generation of treatments for tuberculosis.

The announcement was made to coincide with World Tuberculosis Day.

Wong said in a joint statement with Conroy that it reaffirms Australia's steadfast commitment to ending tuberculosis.

""Improving the health and well-being of communities in Southeast Asia and the Pacific is central to supporting a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,"" she said.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis globally in 2022, 1.3 million of whom died.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

- 'Our persistence has been worth it' -

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

- Speaker under pressure -

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",zawya.com,news,Zawya.com,,0.2,448964446,1,,

Their objective is to augment annual EBITDA by a minimum of $2.5 billion ( ₹20,750 crore), executives were quoted as saying in investors meeting by PTI.

They revealed a pipeline comprising over 50 active projects and expansions aimed at fueling growth. These initiatives are projected to yield incremental revenue exceeding $6 billion. Additionally, they anticipate a surge in EBITDA from an estimated $5 billion in the current fiscal year ending March 31 to $6 billion in the following fiscal year, and potentially up to $7.5 billion by FY27.

Anil Agarwal, the Chairman of Vedanta, during the meeting expressed that the company is poised to reach new heights over the next 25 years. Naveen Agarwal, the Vice Chairman and Anil's brother, elaborated on the company's strategic plans during the presentation.

""Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5 billion yearly EBITDA,"" he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ""incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion"".

""We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of $7.5 billion annually,"" he said.

According to PTI, several significant projects slated for immediate commissioning include expanding the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility's refinery from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, enlarging BALCO's capacity to 1 million tonnes, launching the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to nearly double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, increasing the capacity at the Gamsberg Zinc facility to elevate Zinc International's capacity to 500,000 tonnes from the current 273,000 tonnes, ramping up iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and achieving the status of India's largest ferro-alloys producer with an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes.

""40 ongoing growth projects with a plan to spend USD 6 billion in capex"" will help boost EBITDA from an estimated USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 7.5 billion in FY26 (April 2025 to March 2025),"" Vedanta said in the presentations.

Emphasizing its commitment to deleveraging, the company affirmed that it has solidified a plan to reduce its debt by $3 billion over the next three years through its parent company, Vedanta Resources, while maintaining stable debt levels at the India-listed firm.

According to CFO Ajay Goel, the aim is to decrease net debt to $9 billion by FY27 from its current level of $13 billion. He further noted that Vedanta Resources has successfully reduced the balance sheet debt by USD 3.5 billion over the past two years, bringing the net debt down to $6 billion. Additionally, the company has strategically managed near-term bond maturities of approximately $4 billion to ensure a smoother debt profile.

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation.""

The presentation positioned Vedanta as an enticing investment opportunity, highlighting its impressive track record. Over the past two decades, the company has consistently achieved a remarkable 15% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in EBITDA, with a noteworthy 30% EBITDA margin over the last five years.

Furthermore, the proposed demerger of its businesses is emphasized as a pivotal move, promising substantial value unlocking for shareholders.

Vedanta Limited, owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, boasts a distinctive portfolio of assets unrivaled among both Indian and global companies. Its diverse holdings encompass metals and minerals such as zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, and nickel, alongside ventures in oil and gas. Additionally, it operates within the traditional ferrous vertical, encompassing iron ore and steel production, as well as in the power sector, spanning coal and renewable energy sources. Notably, the company is also venturing into the burgeoning fields of semiconductor manufacturing and display glass production.

On September 29, 2023, the company unveiled plans to enhance value by demerging its core entities, principally its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas operations, forming independent verticals.

Under the restructuring of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will receive 1 share in each of the five newly established entities for every 1 share held in Vedanta. Following the demerger, Hindustan Zinc's operations, along with the display and semiconductor manufacturing units, will continue under Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Vedanta Base Metal, outlined plans for Zinc International to ramp up production to 1 million tonnes by 2030, up from the current 220,000 tonnes. This growth will be achieved through expansions at Black Mountain and Gamsberg mines in South Africa.

Meanwhile, Copper India aims to boost its copper and gold production capacity to 1 million tonnes per annum by 2030, up from the current 260,000 tonnes. This will involve debottlenecking the Silvassa refinery, enhancing units in UAE and Saudi Arabia, and restarting the Tuticorin unit.

During an investor meeting, Vibhav Agarwal, CEO of the company's power business, highlighted a robust electricity generation portfolio totaling 4,780 megawatts. By FY27 (April 2026 to March 2027), this portfolio is projected to generate ₹15,000 crore in revenue and ₹3,500 crore in EBITDA annually, compared to ₹6,910 crore revenue and ₹1,050 crore EBITDA in the current fiscal year.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for increased investment in the research and development of new tools, including vaccines and enhanced diagnostics, to combat tuberculosis (TB).

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, emphasized the importance of such investments in her statement marking this year's World Tuberculosis Day.

Dr. Moeti highlighted that accelerating progress in ending TB requires significant advancements in research and development. She emphasized that TB remains the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, surpassing even the toll of HIV/AIDS.

Citing the latest report, Dr. Moeti revealed that approximately 2.5 million individuals contracted TB in the African region in 2022, equating to one person being infected every 13 seconds. Additionally, TB-related deaths in the same year reached 424,000, resulting in the loss of one life every minute despite the disease being preventable and treatable.

""These statistics underscore the urgent need for collective action to address the ongoing TB epidemic and emphasize the necessity of sustained efforts to bring it to an end,"" she stated.

Dr. Moeti urged all member states to prioritize a comprehensive approach that tackles the underlying causes of the disease while strengthening efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Health leaders were called upon to reaffirm their commitment to enhancing health systems, ensuring equitable access to TB care, and scaling up innovative interventions.

Furthermore, Dr. Moeti emphasized the importance of addressing the social determinants of TB, such as poverty, inequality, and limited healthcare access, to achieve lasting results.

But conservatives applaud the decision to withdraw support, saying spending money on such schools is ‘tantamount to benefiting a dictatorial regime’

Local governments across Japan are cutting the financial support for schools operated by Chongryon, the association of North Korean residents in the country, spurred on by concerns their curriculum portrays Pyongyang in a positive light and about the misuse of public funds – leaving many of the schools struggling to stay open.

A shortage of funds is already biting in some areas, with supporters of the Fukuoka Korean Academy, in southern Japan, launching a petition on the Change.org website on March 4 appealing for people to back their request that the city council reverse a decision to reduce the school’s budget for the coming financial year.

On February 20, the city’s initial budget proposed support of 1.1 million yen (US$7,275) for the school for the academic year that starts on April 1, a contraction of more than 38 per cent from the previous year.

The petition – signed by 5,269 people and submitted to the city council on March 12 – claimed that only North Korea-affiliated schools had been excluded from a 2010 law that guaranteed support for private high schools and said without the funds, the school “will be forced to face a financial crisis”.

Members of the North Korean community in Japan say the impact of reduced support is already being widely felt, with a number of schools forced to amalgamate their operations and others closing.

“It is becoming more difficult,” admitted Han Gyon-hui, a professor of library and information studies at Korea University, in the west Tokyo suburb of Kodaira, the only overseas tertiary-level educational institution affiliated with North Korea in the world.

“There are parents here who are Korean and they want their own children to grow up being Korean even though they live in Japan,” she said. “People are worried about the funds, of course, but I believe that even if local governments do cut the support, parents and our compatriots will step in to help the schools.”Japan’s Zainichi and their ‘return to paradise’ that never was North Korea

Most people of Korean descent living in Japan, referred to as Zainichi Koreans, trace their roots back to the period before and during World War II, when Koreans were brought to Japan as labourers under colonial rule. Many choose not to acquire Japanese citizenship, however, due to a desire to retain their Korean identity and instead hold “special permanent resident status”.

Han said she took part in a 2019 protest in Tokyo against the national government’s decision to cancel subsidies to North Korean kindergartens on the grounds that withdrawing the support was discriminatory, adding that it was yet more evidence that the Japanese government “does not want any North Korean schools here”.

A Chongryon official refused to comment on the issue to This Week in Asia, but it is understood that the association has around 70 educational institutions, from elementary to university level, across Japan today, with a little over 10,000 pupils. That is down sharply from more than 140 schools in the 1970s with over 46,000 students.

Meanwhile, conservatives in Japan have applauded the local governments’ move and say the withdrawal of taxpayers’ money to schools that teach hatred for Japan and deify the Kim family dynasty in North Korea is long overdue.

Ninety-three local governments across Japan provided financial support of more than 230 million yen (US$1.54 million) to schools operated by Chongryon over the course of the most recent financial year, the Sankei newspaper reported on March 15. The national government halted state-level financial assistance to Chongryon-affiliated schools in 2012 and successfully fended off a number of legal challenges to its decision over the following years.

Citing data released by the Ministry of Education, the newspaper said the number of local authorities spending taxpayers’ money on schools promoting North Korean political ideology had fallen below the 100 threshold for the first time and was fully 40 per cent lower than in financial year 2011.

Yet the newspaper, like many conservatives in Japan, was still outraged that any public funds at all were being used to prop up schools where portraits of the ruling Kim dynasty are in every classroom and children learn a very different interpretation of not only history but social issues. Conservatives point out that several teachers from Chongryon schools are on international wanted lists.

In a strongly worded editorial published on March 15, the Sankei newspaper said the schools did not follow the Japanese state school curriculum but instead “sing the praises of the dictatorial regime in Pyongyang” and had been “plagued by inappropriate management”.

“The time has come to stop turning a blind eye to these abuses and pull the plug on subsidies coming out of Japanese taxes,” it added.

The local governments in Tokyo and Osaka carried out investigations before cancelling their financial support in 2016, the Sankei reported, determining that the schools’ textbooks praised North Korea’s dictatorship and made no mention of the abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korean agents.

“Spending public money in this manner is tantamount to benefiting a dictatorial regime,” the report concluded. “Moreover, it does nothing to further the education of the children concerned.”

Yoichi Shimada, a professor of international relations at Fukui Prefectural University and an avowed conservative, agreed that the subsidies should be halted immediately and completely.

“It’s impossible to understand how Japanese taxpayers’ money is being spent to support schools that teach propaganda instead of education, such as blind allegiance to Kim Jong-un – who only earlier this week ordered the launch of more ballistic missiles – as well as his father and grandfather,” he said.

“It is bizarre that they teach this as no sane person could consider Kim’s regime to be anything other than barbaric,” he said, pointing to countless reports of political repression, the use of prison labour and torture against inmates, and a lack of basic human rights in North Korea.

Shimada argued that refusing to support North Korean schools is not discriminatory, as their pupils have exactly the same rights to attend Japanese schools as other children. That parents choose not to send them to such schools because they want to retain their North Korean identity and heritage is irrelevant, he added.Japan mum ‘disgusted’ by Tokyo’s failure to free daughter seized by North Korea

Shimada also pointed out that teachers at Chongryon-affiliated schools have in the past been linked to criminal activity, such as Kim Kil-uk, who was the head of a school in Osaka but was suspected of being involved in the abduction of Japanese nationals in the 1980s. Kim managed to escape Japan and travel to North Korea, although he remains on Interpol’s wanted list.

Similarly, Cho Gyu-son, head of the North Korean school in Shimonoseki, is wanted by Japanese police in connection with the alleged importing of 250kg of amphetamines that were then sold to a Japanese “yakuza” organised crime group.

Shimada said Japanese authorities kept a close eye on Chongryon and its officials for any signs of illegal activity.

A woman whose two sons graduated from a Korean high school in Tokyo sighs with exasperation over these criticisms.

“This problem has been going on for years and children are the ones who are suffering because the cost of running Chongryon schools is so expensive,” said the woman, who did not want to be named.

“But this is our community and we believe it is important to sustain our education standards and protect our national identity,” she said. “Education is a basic right for our children and we teach them to love their country – and that has nothing to do with outsiders.

“And when we hear of a politician saying that we are teaching the children to be spies, we just think that is ridiculous,” she added.2 Korean school students in Japan confronted over Pyongyang missile launches

“We have not been brainwashed. We can think for ourselves. We know about North Korean society. And I do not believe what the children learn in our schools is so different from Japanese schools.”

The woman added that many children who attend North Korean schools in Japan have the sense that they are part of both communities and nations.

“And if we receive some help from the Japanese government, then we would be appreciative and could act as the bridge between the two countries,” she said. “But it makes me sad when I hear that a school that has been teaching children for many years suddenly disappears.”",scmp.com,news,South China Morning Post,,0.192156862745098,448963731,1,https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/08/25/EXPLAIN_Thu_Temp-new_Clean_2.jpg?itok=ceMiZ3Wo,

More than a dozen Canadian diplomats posted in various U.S. cities came to Washington to meet with scores of American lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Looming over their visit was the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House. In particular, there's one Trump policy they're watching warily this year.

The former president has promised a worldwide tariff on imported goods if he wins. This would be stricter than any trade policy from his first term.

Neither Canadian officials, nor Trump's allies, have a clear answer on that. Trump has been vague about which countries and products might be included or exempted.

But Canada's starting position, as one might expect, is that, no, there should not be penalties on a country -- ours -- that recently signed a free-trade agreement with Trump, which he has praised repeatedly as the best ever.

""We will have a serious conversation with them if they're looking to apply that policy to us,"" Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador, told CBC News.

""But I think the starting point is that it shouldn't -- and we have just concluded a deal that is 99 per cent tariff-free,"" she said, referring to the new NAFTA.

It's worth watching Trump's platform closely, as current polls give him a decent chance of being returned to office in the November election.

Even in Washington there's no clear consensus on what his policy might ultimately look like. Ask different people about tariffs on Canada, and you'll get different answers.

""I have a hard time believing that would be the case,"" Michigan Republican congressman Bill Huizenga told CBC News. ""Especially when it comes to the trade agreement that he negotiated, and led.""

North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer says that's exactly what he tells Trump: ""We talk about these things a fair bit,"" he said. ""I think we should have a North American strategy. Not a U.S.-only strategy.""

An expert who supports Trump's tariff policies says he's not sure this will affect nations with free-trade deals; he suspects it probably will, but adds that Trump is attempting to do something unprecedented under modern law.

""There's literally no precedent,"" said Charles Benoit, a Canadian-born, U.S.-based trade lawyer with Coalition For A Prosperous America, a pro-domestic manufacturing group.

He expects Trump would invoke the Trade Act of 1974. Its section 122 allows a president to set a maximum 15 per cent tariff, for up to 150 days, in the event of a balance-of-payments deficit with other nations, which the U.S. consistently has.

He says Trump could then try extending it, again and again, every 150 days. This would certainly trigger lawsuits, as the law says extending it requires an act of Congress.

Benoit's advice: Let it lapse for a day, then keep reimposing the tariffs every 151 days.

""I think that that's something that the president could do. Just do it -- [and] do it a second time after letting it lapse,"" he said in an interview.

One of Washington's best-known trade-policy experts over several decades says such behaviour would make a mockery of the language in the bill.

It would be challenged in court, Gary Hufbauer said. Meanwhile, countries would launch retaliatory tariffs.

As for Canada, here's his prediction: The northern neighbour will get an exclusion, as would Mexico. But it won't come for free.

He expects Trump to use the threat as a negotiating ploy -- a stick to threaten Canada and Mexico into making concessions.

""He will bargain -- to get something for that exclusion,"" Hufbauer said, noting that when it comes to Trump, ""[It's] all transactional.""

As for what Trump might ask for, he's already complained, as has the Biden administration, about the way Canada has implemented certain aspects of the new NAFTA. Specifically, dairy and autos.

""Dairy comes up right away,"" Hufbauer predicted.

One thing Trump has already succeeded at doing is reorienting the American political consensus on trade.

The current Biden administration has maintained most of his policies. The two presidents may differ in style, but they agree substantively on trade.

That philosophy has been articulated at length by Trump's former trade minister. In his book and several magazine pieces, Robert Lighthizer has laid out some of the tariff policies Trump is now running on.

Lighthizer remains in the picture: He's advising the Trump campaign, and recently said publicly that he intends to be involved in the next administration if Trump wins; either serving in an official role, or as an outside adviser.

His basic argument is that globalization has impoverished the U.S. working class; made the country incapable of producing vital goods; lost manufacturing industries that drive innovation; and left it dependent on a potential military rival (China) for basic everyday products.

He has little patience for people who call the United States protectionist, when it has among the lowest tariffs in the world.

And when it comes to Canada, Lighthizer's book takes the country to task for seeing itself as a free trader, then adopting ""parochial"" and ""protectionist"" policies around everything from dairy to television to telecoms.

He said tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel were useful; Trump imposed them, then lifted them, and threatened to reimpose them.

""The fact that President Trump was willing to impose tariffs on two of America's closest trading partners -- one of whom, Canada, is also one of our closest allies -- sent an unmistakable signal that business as usual was over,"" Lighthizer wrote in his book, No Trade Is Free.

The tangible effects of Trump's trade policies remain in dispute.

Several studies say his tariffs had a minimal positive impact on U.S. jobs, and a minimal harmful impact on the economy and inflation.

One trade economist and historian says Trump's policies shifted some production from China, primarily to Vietnam and Mexico; meanwhile, China bought more food from Brazil.

""In the political debate, both the benefits and the costs [of tariffs] tend to get exaggerated,"" said Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College.

But what Trump is proposing now is bigger than his first-term tariffs, which the Congressional Budget Office said shaved 0.3 per cent off the U.S. economy.

Trump also wants Congress to pass a law that would allow reciprocal tariffs -- massive duties on countries with high tariffs, like India and China.

Irwin says the real risk is that in the long term, Trump's policies could trigger a domino effect, toppling the rules-based trading system, making commerce more political and less predictable and leading to tit-for-tat retaliation. He says countries that rely most heavily on the U.S. for trade are the most vulnerable.

""You're right to be worried in Canada.""

Benoit takes the opposite view. If Trump managed to enact his entire agenda, with the biggest tariffs on Asia, he says Canada would enjoy a renaissance in manufacturing.

Instead of reflexively opposing some of these policies, he says Canada should offer to team up with Trump to impose similar tariffs against China.

""Canada should say: 'We're with you. We're walking shoulder to shoulder with you,' "" Benoit said.",cbc.ca,news,CBC News,,0.1686274509803922,448963474,1,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7153260.1711158619!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-election-republicans-transformed.JPG,eng-9421304

Associated Press

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Buckley Cricket Club, founded in 1898, was recently successful in applying for funding from the Your Community, Your Choice initiative and on March 20, club members were visited by Andy Dunbobbin, North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, to discuss plans for the club to discuss. and how the grant makes a difference for players.

Your Community, Your Choice helps to support grassroots projects in North Wales and is supported by the North Wales Police and Community Trust (PACT), the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner and North Wales Police. Funding for Your Community, Your Choice comes partly from money seized by the courts through the Proceeds of Crime Act, with the remainder coming from the Police and Crime Commissioner.

Buckley Cricket Clubs (BCC) aim is to be the most open, accessible, safe and inclusive cricket club in North Wales.

With this in mind, they reach groups who may not have previously considered playing cricket, or who may not have felt capable of doing so.

The club feels passionately about this cause as sport promotes wellbeing both physically and emotionally and creates a real sense of community.

The club's initial target group was girls and women, as they have historically been underrepresented among players, and now they have around 50 female members.

They have also tried to attract players from different cultural and language backgrounds.

The club recognized that to achieve their goals they needed significant investment in their estate and facilities to make it more accessible and welcoming to all people.

The grant will therefore be used to install security lighting throughout the club's car park and patio, with the main aim of making women, girls and young people feel safe as they come to the club via the previously unlit and dark car park .

The Buckley Cricket Club team commented:We believe that by encouraging young people to participate in sport and feel part of a community, we can help keep young people off the streets and into an activity that is positive for their physical and mental health. This also creates a sense of self-esteem that we hope will reduce antisocial behavior. We hope that by improving our outdoor lighting players will feel safe and secure and that we can continue to attract members from all our sections and be as welcoming a club as possible to everyone.

It was a pleasure to welcome our visitors to the club and show them how our project is progressing thanks to Your Community, Your Choice funding.

Andy Dunbobbin, North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, said: I was impressed by the welcome I received from the members of Buckley Cricket Club, who really go above and beyond to serve their community and recruit more people. encourage people to participate in sports. My plan to tackle crime in North Wales focuses on creating safer neighborhoods and supporting communities. BCC and their project to improve safety at the club and increase participation are great examples of both objectives in action.

National Grid Electricity Distribution is offering funding of up to £5,000 each for registered charities and non-profit companies, and £2,000 for unregistered community organisations to engage children in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities.

The Community Matters Fund, worth £250,000, aims to take learning beyond what is covered by the national curriculum with the aim of increasing engagement.

Although schools are not eligible for the fund, parent teacher associations and organisations alike can apply on behalf of their schools.

Successful projects will need to align with at least one suggested theme, like bringing a new generation's attention to the wide-spanning career possibilities in STEM fields.

Other objectives include pioneering hands-on workshops and practical experiments to deepen confidence and expand already interested pupils' skill sets.

Another initiative could be to tackle unfamiliarity towards STEM subjects by granting resources like 3D printers or initiating after-school coding clubs.

It aims to expand the appeal of the subjects, which could potentially leading to profitable and fulfilling professions.

The project has distributed £10 million through its Community Matters Fund in regions like South West, Midlands and South Wales since it began in 2021.

Community engagement manager for National Grid Electricity Distribution, Ellie Patey, said: ""Big challenges facing schools around resources, time allocation and funding have proven major barriers to engaging kids with this vital area of learning. National Grid is committed to widening the appeal of these exciting subjects which can lead to fulfilling and rewarding careers.

""We'd particularly welcome West Midlands projects focussed on supporting young people from disadvantaged or underrepresented backgrounds for whom STEM feels unfamiliar, out of reach or even intimidating.""

She added: ""Inspiring the STEM leaders of tomorrow not only supports National Grid's wider objectives to deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy future, but also plays a part in meeting the anticipated 400,000 roles needed between now and 2050 to reach the UK's net zero targets.

National Grid Electricity Distribution is offering funding of up to £5,000 each for registered charities and non-profit companies, and £2,000 for unregistered community organisations to engage children in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities.

The Community Matters Fund, worth £250,000, aims to take learning beyond what is covered by the national curriculum with the aim of increasing engagement.

Although schools are not eligible for the fund, parent teacher associations and organisations alike can apply on behalf of their schools.

Successful projects will need to align with at least one suggested theme, like bringing a new generation's attention to the wide-spanning career possibilities in STEM fields.

Other objectives include pioneering hands-on workshops and practical experiments to deepen confidence and expand already interested pupils' skill sets.

Another initiative could be to tackle unfamiliarity towards STEM subjects by granting resources like 3D printers or initiating after-school coding clubs.

It aims to expand the appeal of the subjects, which could potentially leading to profitable and fulfilling professions.

The project has distributed £10 million through its Community Matters Fund in regions like South West, Midlands and South Wales since it began in 2021.

Community engagement manager for National Grid Electricity Distribution, Ellie Patey, said: ""Big challenges facing schools around resources, time allocation and funding have proven major barriers to engaging kids with this vital area of learning. National Grid is committed to widening the appeal of these exciting subjects which can lead to fulfilling and rewarding careers.

""We'd particularly welcome West Midlands projects focussed on supporting young people from disadvantaged or underrepresented backgrounds for whom STEM feels unfamiliar, out of reach or even intimidating.""

She added: ""Inspiring the STEM leaders of tomorrow not only supports National Grid's wider objectives to deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy future, but also plays a part in meeting the anticipated 400,000 roles needed between now and 2050 to reach the UK's net zero targets.

The US House of Representatives passed the package on Friday, and the Senate early Saturday morning, about two hours after the deadline.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement.

The latest legislation would provide funding for the Departments of Defence, Homeland Security, Labour, Health and Human Services, Education, State, and the legislative branch through the fiscal year 2024, which ends on Sept. 30.

The package would allocate approximately US$62 billion in overall discretionary funds for Homeland Security -- which oversees border security -- the most contentious part of the appropriation bills when negotiated by lawmakers.

In addition to the US$459-billion bill approved earlier this month, this new measure provides complete funding for the federal government totalling US$1.659 trillion until the end of September, following months of stopgap funding measures due to disagreement on annual appropriation.

In the earlier package, Congress authorised annual funding for several departments including agriculture, energy and the environment, housing, transportation, veterans, and the Justice Department.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, with the help of stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

Since the start of the fiscal year 2024 on Oct. 1, 2023, Congress previously approved stopgap funding measures in September 2023, November 2023, January 2024, and late February 2024. - Bernama, Xinhua",thesun.my,news,thesun.my,,0.1294117647058823,448962478,1,https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x320/0c35/480d250/none/11808/SFSW/us-politics-biden-departure-211014_3983109_20240324153833.jpg,

Here's why,"The signing of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) is the culmination of long, complex negotiations that began in January 2008 and a historic achievement for the governments of India, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

Under the agreement, India has sought an investment commitment of $50 billion in the first 10 years of its implementation. It is expected to receive another $50 billion in investments over the following five years. In all, these investments aim to generate direct jobs for a million Indians. The FTA also includes a clause that allows India to withdraw tariff concessions if the $100-billion investment doesn't materialise.

However, there is concern about the agreement from some quarters about the remedial measures that India can take if the investment doesn't come through. These people have said that since foreign direct investment will come from the private sectors of the four-nation bloc and not their governments, there could be, in effect, no binding commitment.

These concerns, however, are misplaced. Linking trade preferences and tariff concessions to foreign direct investment is the fundamental starting point, and as the EFTA is implemented, procedural steps will fall into place. And even though governments won't be making these investments, the fact that they are signatories makes the agreement part of their sovereign functions and thus binding.

Having said that, there could be some issues in implementing FTAs in general. One glaring example is that of the India-ASEAN FTA, which has been under review as India is looking for better market access. This review is crucial for India as the trade gap in FY23 was $43.57 billion in favour of the ASEAN countries. Countries such as Thailand have raised objections to customs regulations implemented in 2020 which provide for verification of rules of origin to safeguard against misuse of benefits. China exerts considerable influence over the ASEAN countries. For example, it is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Thailand, and the two countries have also increased cooperation in defense.

Regardless of Chinese influence, the Indian government is pushing hard for liberal, product-specific rules in electronics, chemicals and textiles, and has had some notable successes.

The EFTA gives Indian industry access to the EU market. It includes tariff concessions on processed agricultural products from India, eliminates duty on Swiss watches and chocolates after seven years, allows India to import machinery at cheaper rate, and also includes a commitment for audio-visual services such as gaming and animation. EFTA countries have provided significant concessions in service sectors, including accounting, auditing and legal. The visa process will be facilitated for intra-corporate transferees, contractual service suppliers, and independent professionals.

The EFTA is a part of the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), in which India has included matters such as environment, trade, intellectual property rights and gender for the first time. TEPA is the fourth agreement of its kind that India has signed. The others were with Australia, Mauritius, and the UAE. According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), improved market access for goods and services will boost India's export potential to EFTA markets and expand employment opportunities.

The India-UK FTA is also in the pipeline and likely to be signed soon. This agreement, too, represents a timely step forward for both countries. The services sector will gain substantially from it because of the ease of setting up professional services centres.

These are remarkable achievements by the Indian government. FTAs are growth engines for India's prosperity and global economic leadership at a time when China's economy is struggling to emerge from its pandemic slump.

The funds will be primarily used to address water shortages for urban and rural residents, and purchase or lease emergency equipment for water supply and purification.

Local authorities will use the funds to organize personnel to ensure water supply for residents, and provide assistance to those facing temporary living difficulties due to disasters.

With cruise operators set to start contributing to the European Union's emissions trading program, the global Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, wants ""countries to be able to reinvest all, or at least some, of this extra revenue into infrastructure,"" Europe Director General Marie-Caroline Laurent said in an interview.

The sums are not inconsiderable.

Europe's cruise sector is slated to contribute more than $655 million to the emissions program, known as ETS, starting in 2026, Laurent said.

But at least part of that total would be better used if it were redeployed toward clean infrastructure for the industry -- in areas from reduced emissions at berth and at sea, to programs for sustainable facilities at destination ports, Laurent said.

Infrastructure is a ""key concern,"" Laurent said, as electrification of ports and refueling facilities will be essential for the industry's future.

Few industries have faced a tougher post-pandemic challenge than cruise lines. Even after a sharp rally last year, shares have yet to snap back to pre-pandemic highs. Non-fuel costs -- fleet maintenance, food and onboard services -- are also expected to rise in coming quarters.

Currently about half of the industry's vessels are set up for next-generation shore-side electricity, Laurent said. That puts the onus on ports to update facilities.

""We obviously need the ports to be equipped with the newest outlets and to have electrification capability,"" she said.

For a possible model, Laurent pointed to the aviation sector, where sustainable SAF fuel is rated zero-emission and doesn't count toward emissions calculations.

For cruise operators, ""this kind of mechanism would be a good way to accelerate the deployment of alternative fuels,"" Laurent said.",nwaonline.com,news,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,,0.05098039215686279,448961878,1,https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/206809042_cruise_3FGRN77AVVHWPMDIRUOQO7M4X4_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676,

The startup had raised $5.5 million led by Sequoia Capital India last year. The total funding raised by Leap is now at $22.5 million.

With this current funding, Leap aims to expand its product portfolio, strengthen its team across business and technological functions, expand geographically, and also grow its student communities. The company will also establish global offices for institutional partnerships and other business functions.

Arnav Kumar, co-founder of Leap, said in a press statement shared by the company, ""We are a one stop solution for everything that a study abroad aspirant needs. India has the largest pool of STEM educated English speaking graduates, and millions of them want global degrees and careers. This is a big decision and there is a real need for accurate information and expert guidance. Our online community helps students evaluate career options, network with seniors and shortlist the best courses. We then use this data to offer personalised test prep, professional counselling services, visa guidance and financial products.""

Founded in 2019, Leap is building a one-stop platform for study abroad aspirants and international students.

Headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in Bengaluru, Leap offers counselling services, visa services, education loans and other financial products tailored for international students.

Vaibhav Singh, co-founder of Leap, said ""Our mission is to make global education and careers more accessible to meritorious Indian students. We are unlocking access to financial products and career services which international students are traditionally locked out of. You can think of us as a neobank offering tailored products to the international student community.""

Leap offers an international educational loan product that provides - full cost of study, dollar loans to students pursuing international education in the US, zero collateral loans. The startup has expanded its suite to UK, Canada, and Australia.

Leap has helped over 20,000 students in their study abroad journey in the past year, and aims to serve 150,000 students in the current year.

Commenting on the announcement, Amit Anand, Founding Partner, Jungle Ventures said, ""Leap marks our first investment in the edtech space. India is the second-largest market globally for overseas enrolment, and in just a decade overseas higher education annual enrolments from India are up more than 300 percent. In addition, South East Asian markets such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia are also large contributors to overseas education.""

Amit added this presents a huge opportunity in an otherwise fragmented landscape. Leap is addressing this huge opportunity through its end-to-end tech platform and a community-first approach.

""We are proud to partner with Vaibhav and Arnav in their growth journey as they become the default destination for outbound students pursuing international education,"" said Amit.

The education loans by Leap are significantly cheaper when compared with existing market alternatives. The startup also provides international bank accounts for students. This gives them a working US bank account and debit card while in India, with zero charges and the lowest forex rates. Leap is shortly launching a credit card tailored to the needs of international students

Ashish Agrawal, Principal, Sequoia Capital India, said, ""2020 was a tough year for international education with Covid related travel restrictions. We are impressed by the resilience of the Leap team during the last year, where not only have they served hundreds of students with their financing solutions but have also expanded with Leap Scholar providing counselling to thousands of Indian students looking to study abroad. This vertically integrated strategy has materially strengthened the moats for Leap.""

The startup in a span of two years has built a community of over 500,000 profiled members and over 200,000 monthly active users who exchanged 9 million chat messages last month.

Amit Patel, Managing Director of Owl Ventures, said, ""There is a clear need for a one-stop, global student mobility platform - right now the value chain is fragmented and a student has to interact with several entities in their study abroad journey. Leap's solution ties it all together.

This ambitious investment drive aims to bolster the company's annual EBITDA by at least $2.5 billion, positioning it for substantial growth and value creation in the coming years.

Expansive investment pipeline

At an investor meeting, Vedanta executives unveiled an expansive investment pipeline comprising over 50 active projects and expansions across multiple sectors, including aluminium, zinc, iron ore, steel, and oil and gas.

This is a static report, the data below was valid at the time of the publication, but support and resistance levels for MACK change over time, so the report should be updated regularly. Real Time updates are provided to subscribers. Unlimited Real Time Reports.

Subscribers also receive market analysis, stock correlation tools, macroeconomic observations, timing tools, and protection from market crashes using Evitar Corte.

The rules that govern the data in this report are the rules of Technical Analysis. For example, if MACK is testing support buy signals surface, and resistance is the target. Conversely, if resistance is being tested, that is a sign to control risk or short, and support would be the downside target accordingly. In each case, the trigger point is designed to be both an ideal place to enter a position (avoid trading in the middle of a trading channel), and it acts as a level of risk control too.

In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 14.51 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 14.55 is the first level of support below 14.79, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 14.55 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy MACK just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 14.79, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

Among these, the Ethereum presale of 2014 stands out as a landmark event. A select group of investors gained early access to Ether tokens at a discounted rate of $0.31 per ETH. Imagine how lucky these savvy investors were to snatch up this undervalued crypto gem and turn their modest investments into fortunes.

Why Is It a Good Idea to Buy Presale Tokens?

The crypto market is notorious for high volatility, but presale projects stand out as a beacon of predictability, as their price is pinned to a certain level until they get listed on a DEX. So, they are immune to market fluctuations.

The second reason is the low price. As in the Ethereum example above, its presale price was exponentially lower than its post-listing price. Similarly, most emerging projects aim to raise some capital, so they try to attract investors with highly favorable offers.

Why Is It a Good Idea to Buy BlastUP Tokens?

A myriad of emerging projects are vying for investors' attention. The competition is fierce, but certain contenders with a strong concept and high utility clearly stand out. Unlike many junk tokens, such as meme coins, whose value is based solely on the hype around them, the projects with real practical use have a more solid foundation.

BlastUP is the first launchpad on the Blast blockchain, a unique Layer 2 solution offering a native yield of 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. This groundbreaking approach has made Blast quite popular, and it has already attracted a huge army of fans, hitting a $1 billion in TLV in just one month. Moreover, the recent launch of the Blast Mainnet has pushed it to the top 10 projects in terms of TLV. Being a part of such a robust ecosystem, BlastUP is already ticking the boxes for its reliability.

The presale of BlastUP tokens ($BLP) is currently running, and buying them now could be compared with investing in ETH during its presale. The current BLP value is pinned at merely 5 US cents, while its listing price is set at $0.1, which already makes a 50% ROI.

Those who buy BlastUP tokens at the presale stage get access to exclusive early benefits including participation in an Airdrop to get free $BLP tokens. The utility of BlastUP tokens spreads far and wide, offering its users access to:

Moreover, $BLP holders get Booster Points, special tokens that BlastUP is launching to support the community. Booster Point is a fuel for the Community Incentives Program (CIP) intended for the creation of a solid base for launching projects and making them successful.

In just one month, BlastUP has attracted over $2.5 million in investments, which speaks much for its wide recognition. The presale runs until the end of May, so it's not too late to buy a possible crypto gem at the best price.

Don't miss out! Secure your BlastUP tokens today at the most competitive price!

BlastUP's Strong Position in the Blast Community

As a committed participant within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP plays an integral role in fostering mutual growth and progress. Recently, it has established strategic alliances with other esteemed members of the Blast family, marking a significant milestone - the highly anticipated launch of the Blast Mainnet.

The partnerships with Blast Alpha, Blastopedia, and Blast Ecosystem not only emphasize BlastUP's dedication to community development but also showcase its commitment to delivering captivating experiences for its users through entertaining contests. These recent collaborations have the potential to enhance the visibility and reputation of BlastUP.

BlastUP Driving Success for Blockchain Startups

BlastUP is more than a sound investment opportunity; it is a catalyst for creating a rewarding environment for DApp launches. Embracing a motto ""Grow faster, earn more,"" BlastUP is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the success of blockchain startups. Central to its strategy is the Launchpad Accelerator crafted to provide startup teams with comprehensive documentation and refined tokenomics, thereby smoothing the path for effective capital raising.

At the core of BlastUP's ethos is an uncompromising focus on security. Through its rigorous Project Screening, the platform ensures admission is reserved exclusively for the most trustworthy projects, thus safeguarding the integrity of its entire ecosystem. This commitment to security cements BlastUP's reputation as the premier destination for those seeking dependability.

Ambitious Plans for Integrating Web3 and AI Tools

Moving forward, BlastUP is set to revolutionize startup launches on the Blast network by leveraging AI and Web3 technologies. Its 2026 strategic roadmap reveals ambitious plans, such as an AI-enhanced IDO screener, dedicated tools for AI-enabled startup teams, and the launch of an interactive Community Marketplace. This firm commitment highlights BlastUP's focus on advancing its ecosystem's potential and leading the way in blockchain innovation.

Final Thoughts

The volatile yet lucrative landscape of cryptocurrency investments presents notable opportunities akin to the storied Ethereum presale of 2014. In this context, BlastUP stands out as an investment of note, offering potential gains through its ongoing $BLP token presale.

BlastUP is not just another crypto project, it stands as a harbinger of progressive blockchain utility and investment value. Within the burgeoning Blast ecosystem, BlastUP's strategic position is unmistakable. Investors aligning with BlastUP are investing in a vision that champions technological innovation, community synergy, and sustained growth, heralding a new chapter in blockchain evolution poised for success.",bitcoinist.com,news,Bitcoinist.com,,0.2,448960062,1,https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Picture77_728d04.png,

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the package on Friday, and the Senate early Saturday morning, about two hours after the deadline.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement.

The latest legislation would provide funding for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State, and the legislative branch through the fiscal year 2024, which ends on Sept. 30.

The package would allocate approximately 62 billion dollars in overall discretionary funds for Homeland Security -- which oversees border security -- the most contentious part of the appropriation bills when negotiated by lawmakers.

In addition to the 459-billion-dollar bill approved earlier this month, this new measure provides complete funding for the federal government totaling 1.659 trillion dollars until the end of September, following months of stopgap funding measures due to disagreement on annual appropriation.In the earlier package, Congress authorized annual funding for several departments including agriculture, energy and the environment, housing, transportation, veterans and the Justice Department.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, with the help of stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

Since the start of fiscal year 2024 from Oct. 1, 2023, the Congress previously approved stopgap funding measures in September 2023, in November 2023, in January 2024 and in late February 2024.",capitalfm.co.ke,news,Capital FM Kenya,,0.05098039215686279,448959529,1,https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/files/2020/07/BIDEN-1024x550.jpg,eng-9421269

The Daily Tribune - www.newsofbahrain.com

US President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law a long-awaited funding bill passed by Congress, keeping federal agencies running through September and averting a damaging partial government shutdown.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done.""

- 'Our persistence has been worth it' -

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

- Speaker under pressure -

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",newsofbahrain.com,news,DT News,,0.223529411764706,448958614,1,https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_GxRMEf29dF_2024-03-24_1711262183resized_pic.jpg,

Mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd will invest USD 6 billion across businesses that span from aluminium and zinc to iron ore, steel and oil and gas as it looks to add at least USD 2.5 billion to annual EBITDA, its executives said in an investor meeting.

It has a pipeline of more than 50 active projects and expansions to drive growth, which is expected to generate incremental revenue of over USD 6 billion and boost EBITDA from an expected USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 6 billion in the next and up to USD 7.5 billion by FY27, they added.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, according to a presentation made at the investor meeting, said the company ""will get to a different level in the next 25 years"". His brother and vice chairman Naveen Agarwal gave details of the plans.

""Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5+ billion yearly EBITDA,"" he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ""incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion"".

""We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of USD 7.5 billion annually,"" he said.

Some of the significant projects due for immediate commissioning include a refinery expansion at the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, expansion atCO to 1 million tonnes, commissioning of the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to almost double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, capacity expansion at Gamsberg Zinc facility to take Zinc International capacity to 5,00,000 tonnes from 2,73,000 tonnes now, raising iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and becoming India's largest ferro-alloys producer with a 5,00,000 tonnes per annum capacity.

""40+ ongoing growth projects with a plan to spend USD 6 billion in capex"" will help boost EBITDA from an estimated USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 7.5 billion in FY26 (April 2025 to March 2025),"" Vedanta said in the presentations.

Stating that deleveraging was its ""utmost priority"", it said a USD 3 billion deleveraging over the next three years has been firmed up at parent Vedanta Resources without an increase in debt levels at the India-listed firm.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to USD 9 billion by FY27 from USD 13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by USD 3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to USD 6 billion and has ""reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around USD 4 billion"".

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation."" Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin. The proposed demerger of businesses is a ""significant value unlocking for our shareholders,"" it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every 1 share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

(Newsis)

Local crypto exchange Bithumb Korea on Friday announced that the company will spin off its holdings business in a move to increase growth and accelerate its stock market debut planned for next year.

Bithumb Korea will separate its holdings business under a new name, tentatively coined Bithumb Investment, the company said through a regulatory filing. The newly launched unit will take over the holdings, investments and real estate leasing business of Bithumb Korea.

The existing unit Bithumb Korea will be in charge of operating Bithumb's crypto exchange. It will focus on providing a more transparent and stable service for the exchange, the company explained.

The shares will be divided in a 60:40 ratio between Bithumb Korea and Bithumb Investment. The spin-off will be approved through a shareholders' meeting slated for May 10 under an outlook to be completed by June 13.

Last year, Bithumb Korea said it would go public in the second half of 2025. The separation will enable Bithumb Korea to be evaluated only with its exchange business, pushing the initial public offering drive, the company explained. Commissions from its exchange business take up some 90 percent of Bithumb Korea's sales.

""The spin-off will promote the efficiency of each unit,"" an official from Bithumb Korea said. ""The separation is to increase the growth of Bithumb Korea's core exchange operation and new opportunities by encouraging independence and flexibility of each business through separate ownership.""

Over the past few months, Bithumb Korea has been pushing to become the first cryptocurrency exchange operator to go public in Korea. Primarily considering a listing on Korea's secondary tech-laden bourse Kosdaq, it selected local brokerage Samsung Securities as its lead underwriter in November.

The exchange operator has been making bold moves to increase its share in the local market currently dominated by Upbit, the largest crypto exchange here. Upbit takes up more than 80 percent of the market share, while Bithumb owns some 15 percent.

Meanwhile, Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, has not yet revealed an official plan for an IPO here. In 2021, it had considered making a listing on the New York Stock Exchange but failed to make progress. Despite the latest bitcoin rally, the company has been putting forward a stance that it does not consider an IPO.",koreaherald.com,news,The Korea Herald,Im Eun-byel,0.2627450980392156,448956761,1,https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/03/24/20240324050131_0.jpg?1,

It has a pipeline of more than 50 active projects and expansions to drive growth, which is expected to generate incremental revenue of over USD 6 billion and boost EBITDA from an expected USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 6 billion in the next and up to USD 7.5 billion by FY27, they added.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, according to a presentation made at the investor meeting, said the company ""will get to a different level in the next 25 years"".

His brother and vice chairman Naveen Agarwal gave details of the plans.

""Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5+ billion yearly EBITDA,"" he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ""incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion"".

""We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of USD 7.5 billion annually,"" he said.

Some of the significant projects due for immediate commissioning include a refinery expansion at the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, expansion at BALCO to 1 million tonnes, commissioning of the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to almost double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, capacity expansion at Gamsberg Zinc facility to take Zinc International capacity to 5,00,000 tonnes from 2,73,000 tonnes now, raising iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and becoming India's largest ferro-alloys producer with a 5,00,000 tonnes per annum capacity.

Stating that deleveraging was its ""utmost priority"", it said a USD 3 billion deleveraging over the next three years has been firmed up at parent Vedanta Resources without an increase in debt levels at the India-listed firm.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to USD 9 billion by FY27 from USD 13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by USD 3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to USD 6 billion and has ""reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around USD 4 billion"".

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation.""

Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin.

The proposed demerger of businesses is a ""significant value unlocking for our shareholders,"" it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every 1 share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to $9 billion by FY27 from $13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by $3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to $6 billion and has ""reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around $4 billion"".

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be ₹3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of $1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of $1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation.""

Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin.

The proposed demerger of businesses is a ""significant value unlocking for our shareholders,"" it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every one share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Vedanta Base Metal, said Zinc International is targeting a 1 million tonne production pipeline by 2030 from the current 2,20,000 tonnes through expansions at Black Mountain and Gamsberg mines in South Africa.

Copper India is targeting to create a 1 million tonne capacity for copper and gold production per annum by 2030 from the current 2,60,000 tonnes through debottlenecking the Silvassa refinery, units in UAE and Saudi Arabia and restarting the Tuticorin unit.

Vibhav Agarwal, CEO of the power business of the company, at the investor meeting, said the group has a portfolio of 4,780 megawatt of electricity generation capacity, which will by FY27 (April 2026 to March 2027) generate ₹15,000 crore of revenue and ₹3,500 crore of EBITDA annually compared to ₹6,910 crore revenue and ₹1,050 crore EBITDA in the current fiscal.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

Banga, addressing the China Development Forum, revealed that the World Bank Group facilitated $41 billion of private capital for emerging markets last year and secured an additional $42 billion from the private sector for bond issuance, with higher figures anticipated this year.

Economic sowdown concerns

Despite these strides, Banga stressed the need for further advancement, citing a slowdown in economic growth in developing countries, dropping from 6 per cent to around 4 per cent over two decades. He highlighted the dire consequences, with each percentage point reduction pushing around 100 million people into poverty alongside escalating debt levels.

Highlighting a concerning gap between the anticipated influx of 1.1 billion young workers in the next ten years and the expected creation of only 325 million jobs, Banga stressed the urgency for action. To address impediments hindering private sector investment, the bank convened a focus group of 15 chief executives from asset management firms, banks, and other relevant entities, identifying issues such as regulatory uncertainties and political risks.

In an effort to boost investor confidence, the World Bank, in collaboration with development institutions, will commence publishing private sector recovery data categorised by country's income level, beginning next week. Additionally, data on private sector defaults segmented by credit rating, as well as sovereign default and recovery rate statistics since 1985, will be made public.

Capital channeling plan

Banga outlined the overarching objective of these initiatives: to channel more private sector capital into developing economies, fostering impactful growth and job creation. He also disclosed ongoing efforts to establish a securitisation platform aimed at facilitating the flow of institutional investments, potentially unlocking $70 trillion for emerging markets.

Banga lauded China's transformative journey over the past five decades as a testament to what is achievable, commending its substantial job creation, poverty reduction, and environmental strides. Notably, China, once a significant borrower from the World Bank, now stands as one of its major contributors.

It has a pipeline of more than 50 active projects and expansions to drive growth, which is expected to generate incremental revenue of over USD 6 billion and boost EBITDA from an expected USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 6 billion in the next and up to USD 7.5 billion by FY27, they added.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, according to a presentation made at the investor meeting, said the company ""will get to a different level in the next 25 years"".

His brother and vice chairman Naveen Agarwal gave details of the plans.

""Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5+ billion yearly EBITDA,"" he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ""incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion"".

""We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of USD 7.5 billion annually,"" he said.

Some of the significant projects due for immediate commissioning include a refinery expansion at the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, expansion at BALCO to 1 million tonnes, commissioning of the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to almost double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, capacity expansion at Gamsberg Zinc facility to take Zinc International capacity to 5,00,000 tonnes from 2,73,000 tonnes now, raising iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and becoming India's largest ferro-alloys producer with a 5,00,000 tonnes per annum capacity.

""40+ ongoing growth projects with a plan to spend USD 6 billion in capex"" will help boost EBITDA from an estimated USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 7.5 billion in FY26 (April 2025 to March 2025),"" Vedanta said in the presentations.

Stating that deleveraging was its ""utmost priority"", it said a USD 3 billion deleveraging over the next three years has been firmed up at parent Vedanta Resources without an increase in debt levels at the India-listed firm.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to USD 9 billion by FY27 from USD 13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by USD 3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to USD 6 billion and has ""reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around USD 4 billion"".

""Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,"" he said. Parent ""Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation."" Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin.

The proposed demerger of businesses is a ""significant value unlocking for our shareholders,"" it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every 1 share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

""The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

""The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,"" Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Vedanta Base Metal, said Zinc International is targeting a 1 million tonne production pipeline by 2030 from the current 2,20,000 tonnes through expansions at Black Mountain and Gamsberg mines in South Africa.

NEW DELHI: Mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd will invest USD 6 billion across businesses that span from aluminium and zinc to iron ore, steel and oil and gas as it looks to add at least USD 2.5 billion to annual EBITDA, its executives said in an investor meeting.

It has a pipeline of more than 50 active projects and expansions to drive growth, which is expected to generate incremental revenue of over USD 6 billion and boost EBITDA from an expected USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 6 billion in the next and up to USD 7.5 billion by FY27, they added.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, according to a presentation made at the investor meeting, said the company ''will get to a different level in the next 25 years''. His brother and vice chairman Naveen Agarwal gave details of the plans.

''Projects (are) under execution to deliver USD 7.5+ billion yearly EBITDA,'' he said, adding USD 6 billion is being invested across business verticals that will potentially yield incremental revenues of USD 6 billion and ''incremental yearly EBITDA potential of USD 2.5-3 billion''. ''We continuously explore options to create additional value at all our sites. We currently have several high-impact projects in execution mode across all our businesses. These will further contribute to our cost leadership while substantially increasing our operating capacities. These levers will help drive our EBITDA towards the stated target of USD 7.5 billion annually,'' he said.

Some of the significant projects due for immediate commissioning include a refinery expansion at the Lanjigarh Aluminium facility from 2 million tonnes per annum to 5 million tonnes, expansion at BALCO to 1 million tonnes, commissioning of the Athena and Meenakshi power plants to almost double the commercial power portfolio to 5 GW, capacity expansion at Gamsberg Zinc facility to take Zinc International capacity to 5,00,000 tonnes from 2,73,000 tonnes now, raising iron ore production from 5.3 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, and becoming India's largest ferro-alloys producer with a 5,00,000 tonnes per annum capacity.

''40+ ongoing growth projects with a plan to spend USD 6 billion in capex'' will help boost EBITDA from an estimated USD 5 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31 to USD 7.5 billion in FY26 (April 2025 to March 2025),'' Vedanta said in the presentations.

Stating that deleveraging was its ''utmost priority'', it said a USD 3 billion deleveraging over the next three years has been firmed up at parent Vedanta Resources without an increase in debt levels at the India-listed firm.

Net debt is being targeted to be cut to USD 9 billion by FY27 from USD 13 billion now, its CFO Ajay Goel said, adding parent Vedanta Resources has de-leveraged balance sheet by USD 3.5 billion in the last two years to bring down net debt to USD 6 billion and has ''reprofiled and smoothened near-term bond maturities of around USD 4 billion''. ''Vedanta Limited cash flow pre-growth capex is estimated to be USD 3.5-4.0 billion for FY25, sufficient for secured debt maturities of USD 1.5 billion with refinancing as an additional option,'' he said. Parent ''Vedanta Resources' maturities of USD 1.1 billion in FY25 will be addressed partially by internal accrual and partly by other key strategic actions, such as asset monetisation.'' Pitching the company as an 'investment proposition', the presentation said Vedanta has delivered over 15 per cent CAGR in EBITDA over two decades, while 30 per cent was the five-year average EBITDA margin.

The proposed demerger of businesses is a ''significant value unlocking for our shareholders,'' it said.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Limited has a unique portfolio of assets among Indian and global companies with metals and minerals - zinc, silver, lead, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel; oil and gas; a traditional ferrous vertical, including iron ore and steel; and power, including coal and renewable energy; and is now foraying into the manufacturing of semiconductors and display glass.

The company on September 29, 2023, announced the creation of independent verticals through the demerger of underlying companies, mainly its metals, power, aluminium, and oil and gas businesses to unlock potential value.

As part of the vertical split of Vedanta Ltd, shareholders will get 1 share of each of the five newly listed companies for every 1 share of Vedanta. After the demerger, the businesses of Hindustan Zinc as well as the display and semiconductor manufacturing units will remain with Vedanta Limited.

''The demerger is expected to simplify the Group's corporate structure with sector-focused independent businesses. Each of our businesses is at a global scale hence, the board decided to go for a demerger. We intend to build an asset ownership and entrepreneurship mindset where each company would chart out its growth trajectory.

''The demerger will give global investors, including sovereign wealth funds, retail investors, and strategic investors, direct investment opportunities in dedicated pure-play companies,'' Vedanta had said in its demerger announcement.

Chris Griffith, CEO of Vedanta Base Metal, said Zinc International is targeting a 1 million tonne production pipeline by 2030 from the current 2,20,000 tonnes through expansions at Black Mountain and Gamsberg mines in South Africa.

Copper India is targeting to create a 1 million tonne capacity for copper and gold production per annum by 2030 from the current 2,60,000 tonnes through debottlenecking the Silvassa refinery, units in UAE and Saudi Arabia and restarting the Tuticorin unit.

GraceKennedy, with its various brands, has been the sponsor of the top high school track and field event in the region since 2007, funding over $1 billion in that time.

In celebrating their 102nd anniversary the company pumped close to $180 million for the 2024 edition, but Wehby told the Jamaica Observer he expects that to be increased following a thrilling five days.

""We're very proud. A lot of work has gone into it with my team,"" he said. ""When we sponsor an event we don't just draw a cheque, but we sponsor with a heart so you see a significant amount of Grace staff here participating in Champs to ensure it's been a successful staging.

""We've been working well with ISSA and we're quite happy. This year, we invested $178 million. Every year we look at our budget and our sponsorship amount and, over the years, every year we've increased the amount so it's likely [we'll continue our sponsorship].""

In recent championships there have been concerns regarding the conduct of schools, with particular focus on athletes making offensive and disrespectful gestures which were televised globally.

Last year Wehby threatened to pull the sponsorship if cases like those continued, but after seeing no such controversies (up to the point of this interview) this year, Wehby credited the high school sports governing body for its efforts.

""Right after Champs last year we had extensive discussions with ISSA and we were very clear to ISSA our expectations in terms of discipline, going forward,"" he said. ""What everybody in Jamaica should know is that this isn't just a local event -- this is an international event that's being watched all over the world.

""The eyes aren't only on GraceKennedy and the Boys' and Girls' Championships but the whole of Jamaica -- and we need to show the whole world that we are the number one country and that we have discipline. ISSA has been working, may I say, fairly quietly, but very effective. As you can see, this year has been a fantastic event with no disciplinary issues.""",jamaicaobserver.com,news,Jamaica Observer,Daniel Blake,0.4352941176470588,448954776,1,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/03/b4479958dd90ace7b86aaab770f7a41e-1024x682.jpg,

But is she ready to push for it to go in the banks' contract? Not yet.

And maybe that's one hurdle. Because large law firms - similar in so many ways to investment banks - don't have as great a problem, according to the WGEA data. (Major law firms' median total salary pay gap was between 9.2 per cent and 15.6 per cent, while investment banks ranged from 22 per cent to 48 per cent.)

That's despite having many of the same demands that are usually given as reasons that women abandon investment banking mid-career: long-term relationships, the expectation of dropping everything for a client, long hours and in some sectors, heavily transaction focused. But law firms do one thing differently: fees.

When lawyers are engaged, they are paid on billable hours. And if a female partner or senior associate is pitched as being front and centre to the deal, and then doesn't appear that way in the invoice, that's a problem.

Investment banks don't work like that. They take a percentage of the deal, or, a retainer, depending on the work.

It's not just gender issues: bankers push back on anything too specific that limits flexibility, including key man clauses which leave them at risk of losing the mandate if that banker were to leave the firm. The obvious exception is government work.

The WGEA data released shows that the gap between women's pay is even greater for total pay - which includes bonuses - than on base salary. In investment banking, bonuses are typically awarded for completing deals.

""That's a real challenge for the women, they're getting dragged away from what they're doing to sit in a meeting for optics. And if they're not kept in the deal team, they're not getting the experience that enables them to progress,"" says one former investment banker.

Not everyone agrees that there are fewer opportunities for women to get execution experience, but it is clear the women are sharing in less of the bonus payments because the gap widens for most women.

Based on the data, Macquarie is the notable exception to this rule: WGEA's median base salary gap is 22.4 per cent, compared to 22.1 per cent for the median total remuneration gap. At the other end of the spectrum is Morgan Stanley, where the base gap is 25.1 per cent but that blows out to 48.2 per cent when bonuses are taken into account.

No one's asking banks to change their fee structure - yet. But many are aware they need to do far more than simply make the point that it's good to see a female banker at the board presentations.

Again, there might be some lessons from the legal sector, which still has its own issues. Former Telstra and CBA executive Carmel Mulhern has spoken publicly about introducing targets around diversity and gender equity for the firms' major law partners, reported in quarterly meetings. More than that, the firms were asked to identify promising female senior associates that needed more experience to get on the partnership track, and provide feedback on whether anything - including unrealistic deadlines - was hurting their ability to improve gender diversity.

Investment banks are now starting to get some of these questions before firms hand out mandates. In particular, what evidence can the banks provide that women's careers are developing and the processes they have in place are effective?

M&A activity is tipped to pick up in coming months. And while it's hard to imagine any board ditching a long-term adviser on diversity issues alone, maybe the next 12 months will throw up a surprise mandate or two.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,Jemima Whyte,0.01960784313725483,448954465,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6274%2C$multiply_2%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_580%2C$y_191/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/476068005aae8763999a09eb055d784b1e1e9b9b,

Sygnus Real Estate Finance Limited, SRF, has reached the 'exit and reaping phase' of its investment cycle on its first round of developments.

Chief Investment Officer of Sygnus Capital, Jason Morris, says this will now trigger three actions: the orderly exit from projects undertaken since the company was founded in 2019; the reaping of funds and payment of dividends to shareholders; and the commencement of a second three- to five-year investment cycle, concentrating on key assets and joint ventures.

Morris announced to shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on Thursday that there will be a temporary reduction in management fees charged by Sygnus Capital.

Sygnus Capital provides management services to Sygnus Real Estate.

For the next two years, Sygnus Capital will be reducing fees for core assets under management, or CAUM: in financial year 2024, it will fall by half a point to one per cent; and, for 2025, the fee will be billed at 1.25 per cent of CAUM. It will revert to the two per cent range in 2026, Morris said.

""We're voluntarily aligning ourselves with shareholders by reducing our management fees during this period and, as we get to the other end of the management life cycle where we are aggressively deploying capital, we will normalise,"" he said, pointing to the 18- to 24-month time frame that it takes to get real estate projects going.

The delayed payment of dividends also came up for discussion.

At SRF's last annual general meeting in 2023, Morris committed to paying dividends in the ensuing year. But project delays and changing market conditions have scuppered that, and Morris is now seeking to manage expectations.

""I gave a commitment last AGM and I fell on my face,"" he said in acknowledgement.

""I'm not going to give any other commitment, except to say that we are pushing hard to make the first distribution,"" he added while appealing for shareholder patience.

Sygnus Real Estate booked net profit of $211.4 million for the financial year ended August 2023. It made a loss of around $133 million in the first quarter ending November.

At last report, the real estate company had $11.6 billion worth of properties in its portfolio.

Morris says, as the next investment cycle commences, the primary area of focus for over the 18- to 24-month period will be the two largest assets on the company's books: Mammee Bay, a 14-acre beachfront property valued at nearly $6 billion; and Lakes Pen, slated for an industrial park, valued at nearly $3 billion.

""They are two strategic assets, and our time and attention will be primarily focused on those two; not that we're ignoring the other assets, or we are not monetising them, but I just want to highlight the substantive nature of those assets. They're large,"" Morris said.

If the company spends more time on monetising those assets, then the rewards will be greater, he said in appeasement.

Alongside the focus on the large projects, Sygnus will be looking to do joint venture arrangements as the primary mode through which it would tackle other new projects.

The hunt is on for potential joint venture partners.

""Anybody and everybody, if you have good land in a good location and you want to unlock the value, 'link wi',"" he said in invitation. Come and link up the real estate team, we can unlock the value for you,"" Morris said.

Two of the projects tackled in the first cycle were Spanish Penwood, an industrial warehouse complex, and the One Belmont corporate office complex, both commercial developments in Kingston.

Regarding the exit from Spanish Penwood, Morris said that SRF still has 17 per cent of that project to exit. However, the company may end up retaining that 17 per cent stake, Morris noted, saying it might be more valuable to SRF to hang on to it.

Meanwhile tenants of One Belmont complex are said to be in the process of customising their office spaces as they take possession of the nine-storey building.

Morris said SRF will also not be completely exiting that investment. Instead it will be structuring a yet-to-be-determined instrument that will allow institutional investors, SRF shareholders and the company itself to benefit from cash flows generated from leases.",jamaica-gleaner.com,news,Jamaica Gleaner,,0.05882352941176472,448953993,1,https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/03/24/2703310/7886746.jpg?itok=tZ1NIO_z,eng-9417189

DBS Foundation has unveiled the 24 Businesses for Impact (BFIs) that have received the DBS Foundation Grant Award in the latest instalment of this flagship initiative. Five of these awardees are from India and will receive funding and access to a suite of opportunities including networking and patient capital to scale up operations, while collectively uplifting lives and livelihoods.

These purpose-driven BFIs are working at the nexus of economic, environmental and social impact and their innovative solutions are a pathway to a more inclusive, low carbon future. Project Baala, with its focus on sustainable menstrual solutions and literacy, aims to improve the health of women and girls in rural areas. Green Worms is an emerging circular economy enterprise generating employment for women, while Zerund Manufacturing is reshaping the building materials industry with eco-friendly solutions. Karo Sambhav is enabling a more circular economy by implementing collection and recycling solutions for electronic and other types of waste, while Swachh Sustainable Solutions (ReCircle) is championing a traceable supply chain for waste pickers.

The five Indian BFIs were among the 24 finalists for the DBS Foundation grant from across Asia. From a record ~2000 grant applications received across DBS markets, the final grantees were evaluated based on stringent criteria, including their ability to create social and environmental impact, to innovate and on the overall sustainability and scalability of their organisations. The winning BFIs will receive holistic support to scale both their business and the impact generated through grant funding totalling SGD 3.7 million for all the grantees; along with additional support such as customized banking services and capacity-building, along with access to business prospects.

Shoma Narayanan, Managing Director, Group Strategic Marketing & Communications, DBS Bank India said, ""Through the DBS Foundation Grant Programme, we are proud to have the opportunity to try and address any funding challenges faced by these innovative businesses that are doubling down on ways to tackle social issues, while uplifting the most vulnerable among us. This year's awardees from India, focusing on areas like waste management, responsible consumption, inclusive employment and women's health, are working on sustainable solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time. We believe that the DBS Foundation grant and comprehensive support will go a long way towards empowering these businesses to drive positive change and champion social impact.""

Collectively, with the DBS Foundation's support, these 24 BFIs aim to achieve significant milestones by the end of 2025. In India specifically, Project Baala will use the grant for the launch of hydrophobic sanitary pads in India, reducing plastic waste while educating underserved women. The grant will enable Karo Sambhav to launch an e-waste management facility in Maharashtra, generating green jobs and enabling the recovery of critical minerals. Green Worms will utilise the grant to expand its recycling facility in Kerala, befitting more than 120 villages in the region through waste management and job creation. Swachh Sustainable Solutions (ReCircle) plans to use the funds to enhance its traceability platform ClimaOne, diverting 400 tons of waste from landfills, while improving the lives of waste pickers. Zerund Manufacturing will be able to scale up using the funds, to produce eco-friendly construction materials. The growth of these businesses aligns with India's pathway to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by addressing climate change concerns as well as the challenges faced by underprivileged and marginalised communities.

2024 marks the 10 year of the DBS Foundation's work, championing BFIs and equipping them for success. To date, funding totalling SGD 17 million has been awarded to 140 of the region's most innovative BFIs via the DBS Foundation Grant Award. This has helped to address the funding gap commonly faced by many of these young enterprises and the grant awardees have since gone on to raise more than ten-fold in follow-on funding.

Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development and the Pacific, on Sunday announced 17 million Australian dollars (11 million U.S. dollars) in funding for the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis -- also known as the TB Alliance.

The funding will support the TB Alliance's efforts to develop and trial a new generation of treatments for tuberculosis.

The announcement was made to coincide with World Tuberculosis Day.

Wong said in a joint statement with Conroy that it reaffirms Australia's steadfast commitment to ending tuberculosis.

""Improving the health and well-being of communities in Southeast Asia and the Pacific is central to supporting a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,"" she said.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis globally in 2022, 1.3 million of whom died.

That figure is roughly one-tenth of 1 per cent of BlackRock $10tn in assets under management, and some Republican state pension funds still have well north of $20bn parked with the money manager. Overall, BlackRock reported $138bn in net inflows in the Americas last year.

The $13.3bn in withdrawals includes last week's announcement by the Texas Permanent School Fund that it would pull $8.5bn at the end of April, the largest removal to date by Republican-run pension funds.

BlackRock has been trying to respond to the campaign against environmental, social and governance factors in different ways. In Washington it added a senior lobbyist with Republican ties. Last month, the company co-hosted a power grid investment summit in Houston with Dan Patrick, Texas's lieutenant-governor. Patrick has previously expressed ""grave concerns"" about the group's use of ESG factors in investing.

Conservative attacks over the climate change issues have coincided with new caution by BlackRock and other asset managers over participating in industry alliances that seek to tackle climate change. BlackRock has scaled back its commitment to Climate Action 100+ while State Street, JPMorgan Asset Management, Pimco and Invesco have withdrawn entirely.

But BlackRock hit back hard after the Texas fund made its announcement.

""Ending a long, successful partnership that has been a positive force for thousands of Texas schools and families in such a reckless manner is irresponsible,"" BackRock's chief client officer, Mark McCombe wrote to Aaron Kinsey, chair of the Texas State Board of Education, in a letter asking for the decision to be reconsidered.

BlackRock declined to comment on the size of red state ESG-related divestments.

The outflows started in 2022 after West Virginia state treasurer Riley Moore included BlackRock on the nation's first list of financial firms deemed to boycott fossil fuel companies. Texas, Florida, Missouri and other GOP-led states followed suit with anti-ESG initiatives and divestments.

During that period, investors have poured more than $355bn in new net flows into BlackRock's products.

The divestment campaign foundered in Kentucky, where pension officials said moving billions of dollars out of BlackRock and other firms that use ESG factors would violate their fiduciary duty to maximise returns.

In North Carolina, state Republican treasurer Dale Folwell has publicly criticised BlackRock while leaving $18.4bn with the money manager. Folwell said he has negotiated for lower fees and now votes the state's holdings in proxy votes rather than letting BlackRock do so. Folwell said he cannot find a less expensive asset manager, even as he called for Larry Fink's firing as BlackRock chief executive.

""There's only one fingerprint on this whole strategy, and you know how unique a fingerprint is -- and that fingerprint is his,"" Folwell said.

In Texas, local businesses have raised concerns about the state's ""Fair Access"" laws, which call for the state and local governments to divest from financial firms that are considered hostile to fossil fuels or firearms.

A study released last month by a non-profit associated with the Texas Chamber of Commerce found that the laws could undermine the state's efforts to foster a pro-business climate and cost the state $37.1mn in lost tax revenue.

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Biden -- who had the bill delivered to him in Wilmington, Delaware, Saturday -- said in a statement that while the package is a ""compromise,"" it is ""good news for the American people.""

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in the statement, adding that ""it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans"" while investing in child care, cancer research and mental health.

The president also touted how the final package included ""resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include.""

Biden used the statement to urge Congress to pass additional legislation, saying its their ""work isn't finished."" He called on the House to ""pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests"" and urged both chambers to pass the bipartisan border security bill his administration has negotiated, calling it ""the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done,"" Biden added.

The signing of the legislation marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

This legislation is the second part of a two-tiered government funding process. A separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

Speaking of the funding, Jayesh Rajpurohit, Co-founder of Brick&Bolt, said, ""The construction industry in India is poised to reach $640 billion industry in 2022, aided by government initiatives in infrastructure development and affordable housing. Through Brick&Bolt, we want to tap into this massive market, providing a platform that combines technology with transparent processes, making the construction industry organised, accessible, and seamless for both residential and commercial users.""

He adds that between now and 2025, 17 of the 20 fastest growing cities in the world will be in India.

The startup has already begun supply-chain operations of construction materials for its existing sites. Brick&Bolt is also planning to enter the commercial construction (B2B) market in the next few months.

Following an ecommerce model, it provides tech systems and process to make home and commercial construction simple, hassle-free and reliable for its customers.

Brick&Bolt mitigates issues of finding the right contractors, quality issues, price escalation, and project delays by making the entire experience from design to execution seamless. It does this by connecting suitable contractors and architects to customers, enabling transparent pricing and also levying penalties on the service provider in case of delays.

""Currently, the players are only looking at project management and the core tech. There hardly are any construction services or any platform that looks at end-to-end service. A regular consumer has a lot of challenges when they want to build a home, we want to address all of those challenges,"" says Jayesh.

The process is further augmented by an AI-based engine predicting the work schedules and managing quality and progress of on-going projects using computer vision. The average ticket size of the consumers is at Rs 50 lakh and Brick&Bolt focusses primarily on a B2C market, but Jayesh adds that the company is getting into the B2B market organically.

He says the startup has closed a deal with a villa plot developer and are looking at few more.

""Currently, Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) laws are applied only for large construction projects, whereas smaller residential projects do not have any specific laws in place to manage them.

The prohibition was one of many side issues included in the mammoth US$1.2 trillion package to fund the government through September, which passed early March 23 shortly after a midnight deadline.

As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a conservative Christian, scrambled for votes to get the bill passed in his chamber, he ""boasted"" of the Pride flag ban as a reason his party should support the bill, the Daily Beast reported.

The White House said March 23 it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban on flying the rainbow flag, which celebrates the movement for LGBTQ equality.

""Biden believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans,"" a White House statement said, adding that the president ""is committed to fighting for LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.""

The White House said that while it had not been able to block the flag proposal, it was ""successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation.""

The law signed by Biden says that no US funding can be used to ""fly or display a flag over a facility of the United States Department of State"" other than US or other government-related flags, or flags supporting prisoners of war, missing-in-action soldiers, hostages and wrongfully imprisoned Americans.

But while such flags may not be flown ""over"" US embassies, it does not speak to displaying them elsewhere on embassy grounds or inside offices, the Biden camp has argued.

""It will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride,"" the White House said, referencing the month, usually in June, when LGBTQ parades and other events are held.

The Biden administration has strongly embraced LGBTQ rights. In a sharp change from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not only allowed but encouraged US missions to fly the rainbow flag during Pride month.

Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, ordered that only the US flag fly from embassy flagpoles.

In 2015, former president Barack Obama's administration lit up the White House in rainbow colors - delighting liberals and infuriating some conservatives - as it celebrated the landmark Supreme Court decision legalising same-sex marriage across the United States.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward.

In a statement, the foundation said it welcomed a government move to contribute to the costs of expanding the terminal at the port of Cuxhaven, on the North Sea coast.

The government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal, together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), a government spokesperson said on Saturday.

""The expansion of the Cuxhaven port is a central project for the expansion of renewable energies,"" said Stefan Wenzel, parliamentary state secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

Speaking at the China Development Forum on Sunday, Banga revealed the World Bank Group's achievement of mobilising $41 billion of private capital for emerging markets and securing an additional $42 billion from the private sector for bond issuance in the previous year, with expectations of surpassing these figures in the current year.

Despite these significant strides, Banga emphasised the need for further advancement, citing the deceleration of economic growth in developing nations to just 4 per cent from 6 per cent over the past two decades. He underscored the dire consequences of each percentage point lost, leading to the impoverishment of 100 million people, alongside escalating debt levels.

Highlighting the formidable challenge of job creation in the face of a burgeoning youth population, Banga emphasised the World Bank's concerted efforts to address barriers hindering private sector investment in developing economies. To this end, the bank convened a focus group comprising 15 chief executives from asset management firms, banks, and operators, who identified concerns such as regulatory uncertainty, political risk insurance, and foreign exchange volatility.

Building upon recent reforms aimed at streamlining its loan and investment guarantee structure, the World Bank will triple its annual guarantees to $20 billion by 2030. Moreover, commencing next week, the bank, in collaboration with a consortium of development institutions, will begin disseminating private sector recovery data categorised by country income level, aimed at bolstering investor confidence.

Banga further disclosed plans to release comprehensive data on private sector defaults categorised by credit rating, as well as sovereign default and recovery rates dating back to 1985. These transparency measures, he asserted, align with the overarching objective of mobilising greater private sector capital into developing economies to stimulate impactful growth and job creation.

Banga also outlined the bank's initiative to establish a securitisation platform to facilitate the flow of institutional investments into emerging markets. This platform aims to streamline the investment process for pension funds and other institutional investors, aggregating large standardised investments into cohesive packages to incentivise substantial investment at scale.

Banga concluded by commending China's remarkable socio-economic progress over the past five decades, lauding its achievements in job creation, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability.",republicworld.com,news,Republic World,Republic World Digital,0.01960784313725483,448950509,1,https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/worldbank-logo1-171125329579916_9.webp,eng-9421044

Listening to the state's major education lobbyists, one might assume the former, but in the case of individual school districts, it also might include some of the latter.

According to education advocacy groups that want lawmakers to rethink the state's school funding formula, school districts across Massachusetts face a fiscal cliff that could result in staff and service cuts.

In her fiscal 2025 budget, Gov. Maura Healey allocated a 4% increase to public education aid, called Chapter 70 funding, from $6.5 billion to $6.85 billion. This proposed $263 million increase for K-12 schools would follow a $594 million, or 9.9% increase in Chapter 70 funding in the fiscal 2024 budget.

Despite this injection of aid, the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents and Massachusetts Association of School Committees told lawmakers at a recent budget hearing that school budgets can't keep up with inflation.

That's in spite of a funding boost from the Student Opportunity Act. But as was pointed out, that $1.5 billion was primarily directed toward closing education funding gaps in urban districts, specifically in Gateway Cities like Fitchburg and Lowell.

The school groups recently made their case to House Democrats, who plan to unveil their rewrite of Healey's spending bill in April.

Mary Bourque, co-executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said school costs have ""increased dramatically"" over the last few years due to high inflation rates, affecting everything from special education and transportation to building maintenance, curriculum cost, and cost-of-living increases for staff.

She said while inflation was at 7% in fiscal 2023 and 8% in fiscal 2024, the foundation budget for schools was increased by only 4.5%.

This year, Healey's Chapter 70 allocation applied a 1.35% inflation rate to foundation budget rates, based on the U.S. Department of Commerce's state and local government price deflator, according to the administration.

The superintendent, school committee groups and the two largest teacher unions in the state, the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the state branch of the American Federation of Teachers, all backed a request for lawmakers to ""fix a flaw in the Chapter 70 formula's treatment of inflation.""

""The way that Chapter 70 originally worked, the value lost to inflation in those years would have been made up in future years. But because of a glitch that was an unintended consequence of a change in the formula, value lost to the cap in one year is no longer made up in future years. And this is having serious consequences in our schools. We need to fix this,"" Bourque said.

Examples of school districts dealing with funding shortfalls can be found in our area.

In Billerica, the School Committee recently passed a spending plan that some members noted already included a ""historic"" increase from the current fiscal year's budget, rising by 7.65% to $82,845,000.

Despite that significant increase, the budget as currently constructed will require cuts to certain positions, namely registered behavior technicians, social-emotional learning coaches and instructional coaches for reading and math at the elementary school level.

It's still unclear how many positions would ultimately be lost; it likely will depend on how many retirements and resignations take place by the end of the school year in June.

But as one school superintendent admitted, many communities are currently dealing with the consequences related to the cessation of temporary COVID relief funds.

The sunset of federal COVID relief aid, better known as ESSER funding, wasn't mentioned by the education lobby as a reason for school districts' financial woes.

In March of 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, providing an additional $122 billion in elementary and secondary school emergency relief (ESSER) funding.

This aid, coupled with the previously passed CARES Act and CRRSA Act, brought the total ESSER funding to about $190 billion to help education entities at the state and local level address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But because ESSER funds are one-time allotments, they're typically not spent on budget items that have recurring costs, unless the state's department of education or local school districts know they'll have the resources to cover those future expenses.

We certainly don't dispute the effects of the past few years' inflationary spiral on budgets - from households to municipal government and public school districts.

It's real, and that lack of spending power can cut deep.

For instance, the town of Dracut, facing a $3.6 million fiscal 2025 deficit, has asked its municipal and school sides to absorb $1.5 million of that shortfall.

And the North Middlesex Regional School District has asked member communities Pepperell and Townsend to hold Proposition 2 ½ override votes to help raise an additional $3.314 million for next year's fiscal budget.

But we also can't rule out that some of these school districts' financial woes stem from their shortsighted use of those COVID-relief funds, including hiring personnel without a future revenue source to fund those positions, which may have caused budget problems of their own doing.

What's fairly certain: Given the current fiscal year's disappointing revenue receipts, it's doubtful additional school funding will be forthcoming.",sentinelandenterprise.com,news,Sentinel and Enterprise,,0.08235294117647052,448950120,1,https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unnamed-8.jpg?w=640,

He noted that increased investment in the sector would lead to human capital development, which would help address the country's rising insecurity.

The activist, along with other education experts, also called for immediate educational restructuring in order to drive holistic development in the country.

Hassan emphasised the need for a more comprehensive approach to education, stating that the current system was too focused on academic performance while neglecting other important aspects of development such as emotional intelligence, morals, critical thinking, among others.

Hassan spoke at the annual lecture and book launch organised by Professor Benedicta Egbo, themed: ""Reclaiming Nigeria's Future: Strategic Frameworks for Achieving Transformative Change"" in Abuja.

He said: ""We believe that Mr. President has come up with a renewed hope agenda in which education is part of his vision and the buck stops on his table.

""We want to use this opportunity to let him know that he needs to come up with a national plan on education to increase the budgetary allocation to education to 35 per cent, in order to ensure the curriculum in the educational system is reviewed and ensuring proper administration and administrative ordering, whereby no more ASUU strike, no more NASU strike and we believe that the best way we can achieve this is through restructuring...

""What the president must do is to come up with a presidential fiat by ensuring he rights the national assembly on the need to reconstruct the constitution based on existing proposals; in view of the confab report of previous administrations, in view of the SDG goals and proper document. Even the 1963 constitution needs to be merged together.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the package on Friday, and the Senate early Saturday morning, about two hours after the deadline.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement.

The latest legislation would provide funding for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State, and the legislative branch through the fiscal year 2024, which ends on Sept. 30.

The package would allocate approximately 62 billion dollars in overall discretionary funds for Homeland Security -- which oversees border security -- the most contentious part of the appropriation bills when negotiated by lawmakers.

In addition to the 459-billion-dollar bill approved earlier this month, this new measure provides complete funding for the federal government totaling 1.659 trillion dollars until the end of September, following months of stopgap funding measures due to disagreement on annual appropriation.

In the earlier package, Congress authorized annual funding for several departments including agriculture, energy and the environment, housing, transportation, veterans and the Justice Department.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, with the help of stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

In addition to the 459-billion-dollar bill approved earlier this month, this new measure provides complete funding for the federal government totaling 1.659 trillion dollars until the end of September, following months of stopgap funding measures due to disagreement on annual appropriation.

In the earlier package, Congress authorized annual funding for several departments including agriculture, energy and the environment, housing, transportation, veterans and the Justice Department.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, with the help of stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

Since the start of fiscal year 2024 from Oct. 1, 2023, the Congress previously approved stopgap funding measures in September 2023, in November 2023, in January 2024 and in late February 2024.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ...That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defence spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement--the toughest and fairest reforms in decades--to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.",indiatoday.in,news,India Today,,0.07450980392156858,448947556,1,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202403/joe-biden-new-shoes-182121999-16x9_1.png?VersionId=IB1QR8B6YyGHI08PyzyF9X60vBTKc5Qr,

The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 14.66 in case the stock turns against the trade. 14.69 is the first level of resistance above 14.36, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 14.69, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of KT if it tests 14.69 with a downside target of 14.29. We should have a stop loss in place at 14.72 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 14.69, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

The House and Senate are now under serious time pressure to complete the measure after the more than 1,000-page legislative draft was made public.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

President Joe Biden signed the bill on Saturday after the Senate passed after midnight, averting a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, welcomed the U.S. funding for the PRGT, noting the trust had a history of bipartisan support.

""Increasing resources for efficient programs like this can lift people out of poverty in developing countries,"" he said.

No comment was immediately available from the IMF.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

President Ramaphosa noted that the event is an important part of South Africa's infrastructure development endeavours and emphasised that additional infrastructure investment of R1.6 trillion (US$84 billion) from the public sector and a further R3.2 trillion (US$168 billion) from the private sector will be required to achieve infrastructure targets by 2030.

""The government is currently working on projects aimed at developing sustainable infrastructure, boosting business confidence and incentivising investment,"" and emphasised that ""South Africa is positioning itself as a leader in the production of green hydrogen in pursuit of a sustainable future based on innovation.""

The Green Hydrogen Programme, consisting of 14 projects, is an important part of the country's equitable transition. Major water infrastructure projects are under construction in several parts of the country, expanding the capacity of dams and water infrastructure. Infrastructure South Africa is refocusing project preparation to stimulate growth and develop export sectors, manufacturing and the green economy.

""The focus is on projects that contribute to job creation both during construction and operation. Infrastructure South Africa is also preparing projects in a way that promotes inclusivity by increasing local participation. These projects are expected to create over 400,000 jobs during construction and operation.""

The Sustainable Infrastructure Symposium has been an important part of the growth of infrastructure investment in the country since it was first held in 2020.

According to organisers, the event was created to facilitate the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP) and to ensure access to greater and economical sources of sustainable funding, reported by Pretoria News, a partner of TV BRICS.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defence, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70 per cent of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.",navhindtimes.in,news,The Navhind Times,,-0.003921568627450966,448943067,1,,eng-9411206

The White House announced the signing on Saturday after the U.S. Senate approved the package in the early morning hours. That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday.

NATO's top civilian official said last week that Ukraine is ""running out of ammunition,"" echoing warnings by the country's allies, including the U.S.

The Giant Magellan Telescope project is a mainstay for the University of Arizona's top-ranked astronomy programs and its world-renowned mirror lab, helping the next generation of astronomers unlock the secrets of the universe while pumping millions of dollars into the Tucson economy.

But recent developments have cast a shadow on critical federal funding needed to finish the GMT, under construction in northern Chile, as well as for another ""extremely large telescope"" project, the Thirty Meter Telescope under development in Hawaii.

In February, the National Science Board issued a statement and resolution recommending that the National Science Foundation cap funding for both Extremely Large Telescope projects at $1.6 billion.

What's more, the board recommended that the NSF choose one of the two projects for continued funding, citing other pressing research funding priorities.

The board recommended that NSF discuss ""its plan to select which of the two candidate telescopes the Agency plans to continue to support, including estimated costs and a timeline for the project"" at the next NSB meeting on May 1-2.

That's a problem, since the GMT is expected to cost about $2.54 billion and the Thirty Meter Telescope is expected to cost about $2.7 billion -- with as much as half of that funding expected from the NSF.

Top priority

The two telescope projects form the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope program, identified in the most recent National Academy of Sciences decadal survey in 2020 as the top priority for ground-based astronomy.

Both projects have raised a significant portion of their funding from research partners, built much of their telescope hardware and begun ground construction.

GMTO Corp. -- the nonprofit corporation that runs the Giant Magellan Telescope project -- reports contributions totaling about $850 million from 14 consortium partners, including the UA, Arizona State University, the Carnegie Institution for Science, Harvard University, the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Chicago and Australian National University.

The UA alone has so far contributed more than $100 million of about $143 million it has committed to raising for the GMT, while expecting about $250 million in contracts for mirror and other work on the project.

Most recently, GMTO announced in February that Taiwan's Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics had signed on as a partner, though funding support was not disclosed.

The Thirty Meter Telescope has reportedly raised about $2 billion in consortia funding from partners, including the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and scientific institutes in Japan, India and Canada.

In response to the NSB's recommendation, the GTMO Corp. issued a statement citing the high priority set on the USELT projects by the U.S. Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, also known as Astro2020.

""U.S. astronomy plays a vital role in advancing our understanding of the universe and federal investment is a critical aspect of maintaining the nation's global leadership and advancing compelling science,"" GTMO said.

""We respect the National Science Board's recommendation to the National Science Foundation and remain committed to working closely with the NSF and the astronomical community to ensure the successful realization of the highest recommendation of the Decadal Survey, which will enable cutting-edge research and discoveries for years to come.""

Telescopes take shape

Meanwhile, construction continues apace on the GMT, which was conceived in 2004 and had its first main mirror cast at the UA in 2005.

The seventh and final primary mirror for the GMT was cast last September at the UA Steward Observatory's Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab, with three completed and four now in the painstaking polishing stage.

""Our site in Chile is ready for pouring concrete and beginning construction of our enclosure, while major technologies and components are being manufactured across the United States,"" GTMO spokesman Ryan Kallabis said. ""We like to say, our telescope is built in America and reassembled in Chile.""

Construction of the telescope mount structure began in Illinois last year, and the scope's first adaptive secondary mirror and first precision radial velocity spectrograph -- the Large Earth Finder -- are set for completion this year, Kallabis said.

The first-of-its-kind Large Earth Finder, which will hunt for habitable planets and signs of life in the visible light spectrum, is slated for testing on the twin Magellans at Carnegie Science's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, he added.

The Giant Magellan Telescope will boast a tenfold increase in resolution compared to the Hubble Space Telescope and deliver up to 200 times the power of today's best telescopes, offering scientists new insights into the evolution and makeup of the universe, according to GTMO Corp.

Meanwhile, the Thirty Meter Mirror, which as its name suggests has a segmented primary mirror about 30 meters or 98 feet across, began initial site construction on Mauna Kea in 2014, but that was halted in 2015 and again in 2019 amid concerns and lawsuits over environmental impacts and protests by native Hawaiian groups who consider the mountain sacred.

The Thirty Meter Mirror was expected to start operations by 2027 but may be further delayed as a new oversight authority was appointed by the Hawaii Legislature in 2022 to oversee development on the summit of Mauna Kea, which already hosts 13 telescopes.

The GMT and Thirty Meter Telescope have presented the two telescopes as complementary, with the GMT providing a eye to the Southern Hemisphere and the Thirty Meter scope covering the Northern Hemisphere.

The two big telescope projects got together with other astronomy groups in 2018 to form the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope Program (USELT) with NOIRLab, (the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory), an NSF-sponsored research organization formed from a 2019 management merger of national observatories, including Kitt Peak near Tucson.

The GMT is a major program for the UA, whose astronomy and space sciences programs -- including the Steward Observatory and the mirror lab, the Lunar and Planetary Lab, the Department of Astronomy and the Department of Planetary Sciences -- generate more than $560 million in economic activity annually, according to a report issued by the UA in March.

Funding the future

Though federal funding is never assured, top priorities in the decadal astronomy surveys have been funded by the NSF in the past.

A prime example is the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which was founded in Tucson as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in 2003 and was named a top priority in the 2010 Decadal Survey.

With more than $500 million of its estimated final cost of $680 million supplied by NSF funding, Rubin recently finished construction on a mountaintop in Chile not far from the GMT site and is in final testing ahead of operational use in early 2025.

But in its recent statement, the National Science Board noted that the Astro2020 survey had recommended $1.6 billion in funding for USELT projects, and at that level that the USELT alone would eat up about 80% of the NSF's historical Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction budget over five years.

GMTO Corp. President Robert Shelton, a former UA president, has noted that the GMT has raised significant private investment, in contrast to other notable telescopes including the Hubble and Webb space telescopes that have been built solely with government funding.

The push for more funding comes as the NSF should have more resources in the coming years.

The Chips and Science Act of 2022 mandated billions of dollars in spending on semiconductor research and development while authorizing increasing budgets for the NSF.

Part of the law also incorporated provisions of other proposed legislation, such as the 2020 Endless Frontier Act, that authorized new spending to maintain America's global competitiveness in scientific research.

But Congress still must appropriate that money.

The fiscal 2024 federal appropriations bill that funds the NSF, signed into law in early March, cut the NSF's budget by 8% to about $9 billion, mainly by reducing spending on grants for research work.

The bill increased the NSF's research equipment and construction budget that funds telescope projects by 25%, to $234 million for fiscal 2024, though that fell short of the $305 million requested by the science agency.

Sète Natation s'est incliné 7-11 ce samedi 23 mars face au CN Marseille.

It's been a hectic week for Sète Natation. After taking charge of the organization of the N2 French University Championships on Wednesday and Thursday, the Héraultais actually continued two days later with the reception in Marseille.

This was not an easy task and it quickly became clear in the Laurent-Vidal basin. Dentro opened the scoring for the locals after a minute of play (1-0), but a surge would then fall on Sète. Olivier Chandieu's men could not resist the defensive pressure imposed by the Phocaeans, too few attacks were carried out at the end, too many balls were lost and the score turned to 1-5 at the start of the second period .

The gap remained the same at half-time (3-7), then Marseille picked up the pace. On the one hand, Sauton found the post, then the goalkeeper with a default shot. And on the other, the CNM exploited all the spaces left by the local defense to widen a crippling gap (3-10, 22nd).

Leading 4-11 at the start of the last quarter, the Sétois sounded the revolt and won the period with a score of 3-0. For honor. The undefeated leader of the Elite swims in other waters.

Marseille: Vernoux (2 goals), Angyal (1), Izdinsky (3), Manhercz (3), Bouet (1, sp ), Vanpeperstraete (1).

(WLNS) -- Federal lawmakers from mid-Michigan returned a ""yes"" vote on the new budget package that became law this Saturday, March 23.

President Joe Biden signed the new, $1.2 trillion government spending package early on Saturday, six months into the current budget year, eliminating the long-standing threat of a partial government shutdown.

The U.S. House of Representatives had passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, with House Republicans going against it by a vote of 101-112.

House Democrats, meanwhile, voted in favor of the bill by a tally of 185-22.

Among mid-Michigan lawmakers, however, the budget bill received a yes vote from Democratic and Republican Representatives alike.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich. 7th Dist.), Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich. 2nd Dist.) and Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich. 5th Dist.) each returned a ""yes"" vote on the new spending package.

In an email to 6 News, Rep. Walberg made the following statement in regard to his ""yes"" vote:

""The budget bill today reflects the realities of a divided government and compromise. We must do more to rein in federal spending, but this bill helps move us in the right direction. It claws back COVID funds and shifts spending from misplaced political priorities to increasing the pay of our troops and efforts to secure our border. This bill was far from perfect, but it protected important conservative priorities while keeping the government open. If we had not split earlier in this process, we would have had a much stronger bill for America's taxpayers and domestic security.""

The spending package cleared the Democratic-led U.S. Senate by a 74-24 vote after midnight Saturday. The U.S. Senators from Michigan, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, also voted in favor of the package.

The president soon after signed the legislation at his Wilmington, Delaware home.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ...That's good news for the American people.""

Congress passes first package of spending bills just hours before shutdown deadline for key agencies

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Buckley Cricket Club, which was founded in 1898, was recently successful in applying for funding from the Your Community, Your Choice initiative and, on 20 March, club members were visited by North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Andy Dunbobbin to discuss plans for the club and how the grant is making a difference for players.

Your Community, Your Choice helps support grass-roots projects across North Wales and is supported by the North Wales Police and Community Trust (PACT), the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, and North Wales Police. The funding for Your Community, Your Choice comes partly from money seized by the courts through the Proceeds of Crime Act, with the rest coming from the Police and Crime Commissioner.

Buckley Cricket Club's (BCC) aim is to be the most open, accessible, safe and inclusive cricket club in North Wales.

With this in mind, they are reaching groups who might not have previously thought of playing cricket, or who might not have felt able to.

The club feels passionately about this aim given sport helps wellbeing both physically and emotionally and creates a real sense of community.

The club's initial target group were girls and women as they have historically been under-represented among players, and now they have around 50 female members.

They have also set out to attract players from diverse cultural and language backgrounds as well.

The club recognised that in order to achieve their aims they needed significant investment in their estate and facilities to make it more accessible and welcoming to all people.

The grant therefore is being used to install security lighting throughout the car park and on the patio area of the club with the primary aim to make women, girls and young people feel safe coming to the club via the previously unlit and dark car park.

The team at Buckley Cricket Club commented: ""We feel very passionately that by encouraging young people to engage in sport and feeling part of a community we can help to keep youngsters off the streets and participating in an activity that is positive for their physical and mental health. This also creates a sense of self-esteem which we hope reduces anti-social behaviour. We are hoping by improving our outdoor lighting, players will feel safe, secure and that we can continue to attract members across all of our sections and be as welcoming a club as possible for all.

""It was a pleasure to welcome our visitors to the club and to show them how our project is progressing thanks to the funding from Your Community, Your Choice.""

North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Andy Dunbobbin said:""I was bowled over by the welcome I received from the members at Buckley Cricket Club, who are really going over and above to serve their community and encourage more people to get involved in sport. My plan for fighting crime in North Wales focuses on delivering safer neighbourhoods and supporting communities and BCC and their project to improve safety at the club and widen participation are great examples of both of these aims in action.""

Naval Ravikant did a Ask me Anything (AMA) on Twitter and startup founders, investors, and product/tech guys had a field day.

The highly respected and admired entrepreneur and investor answered a barrage of crowd-sourced questions on everything from his views on life, free will, and happiness/fear, to his thoughts on the future of technology, the next big investment bets, crypto, and on startups/entrepreneurship.

Naval's motivation for doing the AMA on Twitter? Boredom, he says. ""Plus some misguided notion that making my followers happy means something.""

As the co-founder of AngelList, a platform where startups and angel investors can connect and hire teams, a serial entrepreneur, and an investor in many technology giants such as ride-hailing firm Uber, social media platform Twitter, and hundreds more, Naval's views on wealth creation, on life and happiness, on startups and investing, and on product and tech are widely followed and revered by the startup and tech world.

Here are some key takeaways from Naval Ravikant's latest AMA on Twitter:

Question: What is Naval afraid of?

Naval Ravikant: ""(Afraid of) Well-meaning people with easy lives throwing away the unique freedoms that they take for granted.""

Question: What made you who you are today?

Naval Ravikant: Intellectual curiosity + determination.

Naval Ravikant: Decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), someday.

Question: Three best investments for the next decade?

Naval Ravikant: I'm rooting for it. Harder for creative groups.

Question: How much will bitcoin be at the end of next year?

Naval Ravikant: It'll moon right after you've given up hope.

Question: Which sector would see the most disruption from technology over the next five years?

Question: What's your view on DeFi or decentralised finance?

Naval Ravikant: The beginning of the end for Wall Street.

Question: Silicon Valley and universities are pathological, to say the least. How would you create new Schelling points for smart people?

Naval Ravikant: On the web. Crypto is one such Schelling point.

Question: What will be the most attractive (in demand/necessary) skill five years down the line? Why?

Naval Ravikant: Hard sciences, math, computers, and engineering are never going out of style.

Question: Which academic discipline for example Psychology, Physics and History should everyone learn?

Naval Ravikant: Physics. The social sciences are heavily propagandised, non-falsifiable, and don't replicate.

Question: Does the goal-post of happiness change once it is achieved?

Naval Ravikant: Happiness is not a thing that can be possessed.

Question: Your view on the future of status driven societies like India?

Naval Ravikant: ""All society is everywhere status driven. The question is if India can sustain an creator/innovator class that isn't corrupt"".

Question: How do you know when you've found the thing you want to focus all your life and energy on? Do you wake up some day and realise it or is it a slow process?

Naval Ravikant: You're overthinking it. As Steve Jobs said, you can only connect the dots looking backwards.

Question: What was the one thing your mother did for you you're most grateful for? What was one thing your father did for you you're most grateful for?

Naval Ravikant: My mother gave me unconditional love. My father gave me self-reliance.

Question: Is there any meaning to our existence as conscious balls of meat?

Naval Ravikant: If there was any single meaning, then we'd all be prisoners to that meaning.

Naval Ravikant: Soak in the consequences of being emotional.

Naval Ravikant: Human mind can't model its own future actions (not enough computation power). Universe can't model its own actions either. Therefore one can have no free will (it's all particle collisions), but the future stays indeterminate.

Question: What are the most common/harmful cognitive traps that people fall prey to?

Naval Ravikant: Karl Popper, David Deutsch, Arthur Schopenhauer, Osho, J. Krishnamurti, Anthony DeMello, Seneca, Kapil Gupta, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, there are too many...

Naval Ravikant: They are literally everywhere. Ideas are not the limiting factor.

Question: From the reference frame of a junior engineer, what do you look for in an early-mid stage startup before you decide to climb aboard?

Question: Your biggest concern/worry for the next decade?

Naval Ravikant: The US becomes inhospitable to innovation and goes the way of much of Europe. And Asia/Africa aren't yet ready to step up.

Question: How can I learn to reason in first principles?

Naval Ravikant: Make sure that you really, really understand something from the ground up before reasoning about it.

Question: What is the greatest invention of our lifetime?

Naval Ravikant: The smartphone, and that's why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.

Naval Ravikant: The Beginning of Infinity (by David Deutsch).

Question: Best way to get started making a stream of passive income?

Naval Ravikant: Build something the Internet wants.

Question: How would you deal with indecisiveness on life path/career choice?

Naval Ravikant: Keep looking. You'll know when you find it.

Naval Ravikant: Find work that doesn't feel like a sacrifice and then you won't be thinking about retirement.

Question: Suggestions on when to decide to move on from a job?

Naval Ravikant: If you're thinking about it, then it's probably time.

Question: You think it is possible to be at peace without being happy?

Naval Ravikant: When most people say they want happiness, they actually want peace.

Question: What's a common trap to avoid in pursuit of self-awareness?

Naval Ravikant: Feeling like you've accomplished something.

Question: One piece of advice on how to take better decisions in life?

Naval Ravikant: Complete, utter, and total honesty.

Naval Ravikant: I'm just talking. Some think it's wisdom, some think it's drivel.

Question: What do you wish existed in the world that does not?

Naval Ravikant: Genetic engineering and spacefaring vehicles.

Question: If you could teach everyone just one concept / idea, what would it be?

Naval Ravikant: The Principal-Agent Problem (Act like an owner: If you think and act like an owner, it's only a matter of time until you become an owner.)

Question: How to be the best in your respective field?

Question: What percentage of your thoughts/beliefs do you withhold from sharing due to the fact that the majority of ppl would likely misunderstand/lack the context to fully appreciate them?

Question: When are you planning your next tweet storm? Also, what would that be about?

The Digital Economy En­hancement Project (DEEP) ($78 million) will support the expan­sion of digitally enabled public services delivery for citizens and firms, while the second ad­ditional financing for the Sindh Barrages Improvement Project (SBIP) ($71.7 million) will sup­port better resilience to floods and improvements in the reli­ability, safety, and management of the three Sindh barrages.

""The catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan in 2022 were a tragic reminder of the impor­tance to build resilience to such disasters, including by strength­ening barrages and their man­agement,"" said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan. Also, supporting the growing digital economy in Pakistan is key for economic and social development, broadening connectivity and access to gov­ernment and financial services for citizens and entrepreneurs, particularly women.

The Digital Economy Enhance­ment Project (DEEP) will develop digital authentication and data-sharing platforms to enable Paki­stan to respond more effectively and efficiently to shocks, deliver better e-government services to citizens and firms, and support regulatory reforms in the sector, including to enable greater pri­vate participation, and strength­ening personal data protection and online safety. The project will also promote financial inclusion by enabling women in particu­lar, to open bank accounts or ap­ply remotely for credit through a smartphone application. It will also contribute to addressing barriers such as limited mobility and digital literacy.

""The digital economy and de­mand for digital government services have been growing across the country, increasing the need for connectivity, digi­tal payments, and secure and trusted digital transactions. The project takes a whole-of-government approach to digital transformation and will help ensure that digital platforms are inclusive and trusted,"" said Shan Rehman, Task Team Lead­er for the project.

The second additional financ­ing for the Sindh Barrages Im­provement Project (SBIP) will support the full completion and commissioning of the Guddu and Sukkur barrages rehabili­tation works and improve the management of three barrages in Sindh including Guddu, Suk­kur and Kotri. Having safe and effective barrages to convey flood-waters downstream is a crucial part of building climate resilience in Sindh. The addi­tional financing will also con­tribute to strengthening the provincial Barrage Management Unit's technical capacities, pro­moting women's participation in emergency preparedness, and implementing extensive citizen engagement and stake­holder participation.

More than 600 attendees, including diplomatic envoys, representatives of do­mestic and overseas governmental agen­cies and international economic organ­isations, as well as executives of Fortune Global 500 enterprises and well-known multinational companies, were involved in discussions on deepening investment in the Chinese market, promoting green and open development, and enhancing supply chain efficiency.

Hubei is a vital growth pole for the de­velopment of the Yangtze River Econom­ic Belt. It has great market vitality and serves as the financial and technological center of central China. Over the years, the province has been working closely with European countries to facilitate the expansion and improvement of bilateral trade and investment.

According to the provincial department of commerce, Hubei's total foreign trade volume with Europe was 124.12 billion yuan (about 17.5 billion US dollars) in 2023, up 28.3 percent year on year.

There are about 700 European compa­nies that have invested in Hubei, including 74 Fortune Global 500 firms. Ezhou Hua­hu Airport, located in the city of Ezhou in Hubei, has successfully opened interna­tional freight routes to countries such as Belgium and Germany, and China-Europe freight trains now serve 109 cities in 40 countries across Eurasia, with over 1,000 train trips operated last year.

""We've been deeply involved over 40 years in the Chinese market, and we are one of China's largest foreign investors in electricity generation with nuclear power,"" said Fabrice Fourcade, chairman and CEO of EDF (China) Holding Ltd, at a celebration of the 10th anniversary of an agreement to build the Sino-French Wu­han Ecological Demonstration City.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic rela­tions between France and China, EDF is happy and ready to continue deepening cooperation with Hubei for a successful energy transition, Fourcade said.

The event also showcased promising Germany-China cooperation prospects in fields such as green development and rail transportation. Since the Wuhan Sino-German International Industrial Park was constructed more than four years ago, it has attracted 58 foreign-funded enterprises. Germany-based Knorr-Bremse Group established ties with Hubei over 10 years ago, exploring cooperation in the commercial vehicle sector, and it has since participated ex­tensively in the construction of multiple rail transit projects in Wuhan.

By the end of 2023, Knorr-Bremse had contributed to the design of nearly 380 kilometres of rail in Hubei, designing 12 subway and tram lines, and provid­ing safe and reliable daily travel services for millions of Hubei residents, said Eric Bi, president and member of the Knorr-Bremse RVS China Board. Knorr-Bremse will continue increasing its investment in R&D and local capacity-building for key technologies such as braking systems, and it will build an innovative system based on the local supply chain, Bi said.

Hubei is now consolidating its green and high-quality development momen­tum. Since 2016, the province has imple­mented more than 28,000 major tech­nological transformation projects, with energy consumption per unit of GDP decreasing by 20.2 percent, construction land use by 23 percent, and carbon emis­sions by 23.9 percent.

China and Europe are each other's ma­jor partners in investment and trade, said Ning Jizhe, executive vice chairman of the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges. A long-term, favorable future for China-Europe relations relies on the new achievements of complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, he noted.",nation.com.pk,news,The Nation,,0.4823529411764707,448939035,1,https://www.nation.com.pk/assets/thenation_202006/images/no-image-large.jpg,

The Cranbourne facility took in 739 cats from 2020 to 2021, 1093 from 2021 to 2022, and 1393 from 2022 to 2023 in the City of Casey area.

Spokesperson Suzana Talevski said there had been a steady increase and it was a quite staggering number.

""There are just not enough animals that are being desexed,"" she said.

""As much as we've tried over the years to educate and inform the community about the importance of desexing your pets, it has worked to a degree, but not enough to stop those numbers getting higher and higher.

""What we need to do is to work together with the community, the local government, and the State Government to make sure we've got programs that provide low-cost desexing alternatives because we know that the cost of living does bite, and there are a lot of families doing it tough.""

Casey Council currently has 8439 registered cats, and the majority are desexed except those with exemptions.

The State Government has recently committed $300,000 to run a trial program to increase cat desexing rates, address cat overpopulation, and support vulnerable cat owners.

Councils can now apply for grants of up to $25,000 to deliver targeted cat desexing programs within their community.

The council-run programs will focus on people who care for semi-owned and unowned cats and help them take full ownership of these cats. The program will also provide free and low-cost desexing services to cats owned by Victorians who may be experiencing financial hardship in the program's target areas.

Executive director of animal welfare Victoria Dr Trevor Pisciotta said desexing cats helped reduce the burden of over-population on Victoria's domestic animal services.

""Although 95 per cent of registered cats are desexed by the age of two, cats can have multiple litters in this time. This can sadly result in thousands of cats entering the Victorian pound and shelter system each year,"" he said.

Ms Talevski said the recent program was a great start, which the shelter welcomed.

""But when you think about the fact that it will be divided between councils in Victoria, then that means it's probably not going to have the impact that we need to really make a substantial difference in reducing the number of cats that are out there,"" she said.

She pointed out the cat population issue was likely the number one issue facing the shelter.

""And it doesn't seem to be getting any better,"" she said.

""We really need support from the State Government to provide adequate funding for those initiatives.""

City of Casey's manager connected communities Callum Pattie said Casey had a 24-hour cat curfew in place since 1999 to address cat issues in the community.

""Uncontrolled cats can have a significant impact on local wildlife and by containing cats to their owner's property, it not only reduces the impact on the wildlife but helps keep the cat itself safe from other stray animals, disease, and harm from vehicles,"" he said.

""It is important that pet owners practice responsible pet ownership by ensuring their cat is contained to their property, microchipped, registered with council, and wearing a registration tag at all times.

""Should a cat be found wandering outside their owner's property and if registered with the council, the cat is returned home, and the owner is given a warning on the first occurrence. If the wandering cat is found and is unregistered, they are taken to the pound and the owner will be issued with an infringement penalty.""",cranbournenews.starcommunity.com.au,news,Cranbourne Star News,Jin Hui,0.2784313725490195,448938476,1,https://cranbournenews.starcommunity.com.au/files/2024/03/Catsgen_223731_03.jpg,eng-9421222

The White House said Saturday it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban (Representational)

Washington, United States:

Tucked in the massive funding bill signed Saturday by President Joe Biden is a provision banning the flying of LGBTQ Pride flags over US embassies, but the White House has vowed to work toward its repeal.

The prohibition was one of many side issues included in the mammoth $1.2 trillion package to fund the government through September, which passed early Saturday shortly after a midnight deadline.

As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a conservative Christian, scrambled for votes to get the bill passed in his chamber, he ""boasted"" of the Pride flag ban as a reason his party should support the bill, the Daily Beast reported.

The White House said Saturday it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban on flying the rainbow flag, which celebrates the movement for LGBTQ equality.

""Biden believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans,"" a White House statement said, adding that the president ""is committed to fighting for LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.""

The White House said that while it had not been able to block the flag proposal, it was ""successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation.""

The law signed by Biden says that no US funding can be used to ""fly or display a flag over a facility of the United States Department of State"" other than US or other government-related flags, or flags supporting prisoners of war, missing-in-action soldiers, hostages and wrongfully imprisoned Americans.

But while such flags may not be flown ""over"" US embassies, it does not speak to displaying them elsewhere on embassy grounds or inside offices, the Biden camp has argued.

""It will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride,"" the White House said, referencing the month, usually in June, when LGBTQ parades and other events are held.

The Biden administration has strongly embraced LGBTQ rights. In a sharp change from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not only allowed but encouraged US missions to fly the rainbow flag during Pride month.

Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, ordered that only the US flag fly from embassy flagpoles.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the US$1.2 trillion (RM5.7 trillion) package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday yesterday, when the House of Representatives passed a US$1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defence and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies yesterday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare manoeuvre that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same manoeuvre led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 per cent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 per cent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated. -- AFP",malaymail.com,news,Malay Mail,,0.1843137254901961,448936660,1,https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2024/03/24/thumbs/400x400/196928.jpg,

The scheme is a continuation of the one put in place a year ago by the Labour government, and is expected to benefit up to 200,000 students.

But Education Minister Erica Stanford said the funding was due to run out in June.

Continuing the funding was a matter of dignity, and it meant girls would not have to miss school because they did not have the access to period products, Stanford said.

""Young women deserve equal opportunities in education, which is why continuing this initiative is so important,"" Stanford said in a statement.

""We have an attendance problem in this country, and I have been working very closely with David Seymour who's very supportive of this policy as well, to make sure that we are giving all students the ability to come to school, and if that means providing period products at school then we will do it,"" she told RNZ.

""We are also encouraging students, and I know schools have been encouraging young women to be able to take period products home on the weekends, for holidays, for evening, so it's not just for school time.""

The University of Otago estimates up to 95,000 young New Zealanders could be missing school because of a lack of access to period products.

All intermediate, kura and secondary schools can opt in to the scheme.

Acting Minister for Women Louise Upston said this was a positive step in addressing period poverty.

""A lack of access to period products can be extremely stressful, disruptive and can impact students' confidence while learning.

""For too long, periods have not been discussed openly. It's important conversations around our bodies are normalised, and part of this means ensuring young women can access the products they need, without feeling embarrassed.""

The fintech platform said the transaction is a key milestone, and is its first white label deal. It noted that the inventory is that of an existing client of Banco BPM. The client is within the agrifood supply chain, producing Italian cheese, it said.

White labelling refers to rebranding a manufacturer's product under the name of a seller.

It said Banco BPM will fund the transaction via an EUR8.5 million bank debt as well as EUR1.5 million of equity investment.

It added that the white label client has signed a commitment up to EUR10 million to become a re-marketer of a potential client in Supply@Me's pipeline.

Chief Executive Alessandro Zamboni said: ""Achieving the Commitment from BBPM for our first White Label transaction is a momentous milestone for the group which demonstrates the value and applicability of our proprietary Inventory Monetisation model for commercial banks and their customer base.

""BBPM is the perfect partner for us to initiate and scale our White Label business line. It's credibility and long-standing reputation as one of Italy's foremost leading banking groups will enable us to bring our solution to a much greater number of clients, providing a means for businesses to improve their capital positions by offering access to funding based exclusively on the value of their inventory.""

Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding. (File)

US President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law a long-awaited funding bill passed by Congress, keeping federal agencies running through September and averting a damaging partial government shutdown.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done.""

'Our persistence has been worth it'

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

Speaker under pressure

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",ndtv.com,news,NDTV,Nikita Sharma,0.1372549019607843,448935002,1,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-03/5t1qk6f8_joe-biden-reuters_625x300_11_March_24.jpeg?ver-20240316.08,spa-3422544

Higgins voted against the bill, despite securing $2.3 million in federal funding for an emergency operations center at the port in Morgan City, Louisiana.

The technical summary data tells us to buy JPI near 19.02, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 18.97 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 19.02 is the first level of support below 19.05, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 19.02 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy JPI just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 19.05, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of JPI if it tests n/a with a downside target of 18.42. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 19.08 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy JPI just slightly over 19.08, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 19.04 in case the stock turns against the trade. 19.08 is the first level of resistance above 19.05, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 19.08, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of JPI if it tests 19.08 with a downside target of 18.42.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to usher in a new age of productivity and performance in the investment industry.

With the recently acquired ability to understand and produce writing, speech and images, and the long-demonstrated power in predictively processing high-dimensional data in complex domains, AI-empowered systems have the potential to revolutionise every corner of the industry.

Read: Nvidia becomes Tesla's successor as market flips from EV to AI

The firms able to position themselves to catch the most significant productivity wave since the internet revolution of the early 2000s will realise an order of magnitude step change in the efficiency and effectiveness of their processes.

The technology isn't a magic bullet, but its potential impact on the competitive landscape is immense.

The most successful firms won't simply deploy every bit of AI they can find. Rather, they'll need to carefully evaluate where and how to strategically apply these tools and technologies based on a considered understanding of the business and investment process implications.

Rezco has been investing heavily in our next-generation, AI-centred investment management tooling over the last six years through our partnership with Alis Exchange (recently featured by Google Cloud as a lighthouse case study for innovation in the industry).

Given the latest wave of interest in AI, we thought it would be a good time to share some of the thinking that underlies our AI strategy with clients and to invite commentary and debate on where others agree or differ in opinion.

Accelerators vs. Augmentors: Understanding different AI impacts

We can broadly divide AI-driven opportunities into two categories:

Process accelerators: These AI tools optimise processes by dramatically increasing the speed of the investment process. They don't necessarily do things better than humans but work at speeds far beyond human capabilities. A powerful language model can synthesise key investor opinions, earnings call transcripts, and research reports within seconds, giving a human analyst a substantial head start.

For example, it takes about 20-30 hours of detailed work (reading sell side, earnings calls, reports, prior coverage, market and news commentary) to synthesise a good ""key drivers"" and ""bull case/bear case consensus summary"". A decent LLM (large language model) can do that in 20-30 seconds.

Maybe it gets to a slightly worse end product, but it is 1/3000th of the time and effort. Investment managers are in the information processing business and the speed with which information needs to be processed to remain competitive in public markets is experiencing a step change.

Augmentors: Augmentor AI tools meaningfully improve a person's capabilities. Perhaps this could be AI that identifies unique anomalies in trading data hinting at potential fraud or software that recommends portfolio rebalancing based on highly complex risk considerations.

Augmentors elevate human skills.

We're already using AI to materially augment the sophistication of our global equity screening process. The old style of taking a week to build a model and produce a report, post earning updates is struggling in a world where a lot of the alpha can happen in the pre-market after an earnings announcement.

In global equity, the traditional long-only style is struggling to compete against passives on the one hand and massively resourced pod shops on the other. Good AI models are able to find the patterns in the data and help PMs react quickly. But this is just the beginning; the complexity will grow exponentially, so the gaps between the early and late adopters will increase.

Rethinking investment analysts

Analysts will need to adapt. AI's information processing abilities could render traditional analysts' jobs obsolete. Instead, analysts of the future will need to showcase stronger critical thinking, problem-solving, and synthesis skills.

The goal becomes less about information production and more about leveraging insights - a shift more closely aligned with a portfolio manager's traditional role. The fear of AI-caused job losses is natural, but we need to focus on the competitive edge.

Firms shouldn't simply fear AI but rather fear falling behind those who are harnessing it powerfully.

Embracing (but not blindly accepting) AI

A valid and common criticism of AI tools is, ""it's a black box"" or to hear managers espouse the ""explainability"" value of simple Machine Learning 1.0 models.

ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW

Having said that, there are probably only ten people in the world who really understand the inner workings of frontier foundational models such as GPT-4, and this doesn't stop it from being really useful to millions of users. Tools like ChatGPT are impressive, but it's vital to use these powerful black boxes intelligently.

It's tempting to fully trust output, but the key is learning by doing. The more we interact with AI models, the better we understand their capabilities and limitations. Verification of AI-produced work remains essential.

Invest in your foundation: Data and digitisation

Catching the AI wave requires having something to ride. Like the internet revolution before it, firms need to have the data and digitisation foundation in place to capitalise on the AI opportunity or risk being left helplessly paddling in a vain attempt to play catch up.

In the funds industry, laying the data and digitisation foundation for AI is a particularly acute challenge. Data moves through the fund's ecosystem in a flood of disparate data formats, definitions, and templates. These PDFs, Excel files, emails and CSVs settle within the inscrutable crevices of SharePoints, server drives and email mailboxes like the accumulating detritus of a hoarder's basement.

Might an honest investment professional's job description read, ""Help wanted. Experience tracking down and

manually transposing data.""

To truly make the most of AI, we can't ignore the prerequisite work. Firms need clean, structured, and well-managed data as the building blocks for AI to be helpful.

Today, too much valuable data exists in messy formats like PDFs and emails, hidden and scattered within the digital workplace. Data management and digitisation investments are just as crucial as deploying the fanciest AI toolsets. Commentators on the ""Pod Shop"" world often talk about the high systems and technology barriers to entry to be able to compete.

From learning investing 'on the job' to AI fund management

Is the AI story priced for perfection?

Our thesis is that having a coherent and well-executed digitisation and data strategy will similarly become table stakes for managers moving into an AI world.

The question isn't ""Have you spent millions on alt-data?"" but whether you can effectively create a digitised manifestation of your investment process that enables the seamless collaboration of people with AI systems.

Conclusion

AI's ability to generate text, speech, and images will change the way investment funds work. Firms that thoughtfully prepare will unlock powerful productivity gains.

Just as the internet revolutionised industries, AI is poised to do the same for those who plan strategically. This isn't just about cutting costs. It's about increasing capabilities, and the most proactive firms will find an unmatched competitive advantage in the years to come.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

House Republicans railed against a provision of the $1.2 trillion federal funding package that passed Friday that will fund a new FBI headquarters in Maryland.

Tucked away in the 1,012-page bill was a line that appropriated $200 million for the General Services Administration to build a new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, Maryland. The new funding outraged some House Republicans, who have accused the bureau of political bias.

""The $1.2 trillion, 1000-page swamp-bus released in the dead of night includes $200 MILLION for a new FBI Headquarters So much for those 'cuts' to FBI,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on X.

The FBI funds were included in a list of ""sellouts and failures"" contained in the spending package posted by Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.

SENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Republicans hold a long list of grievances against the FBI including the investigations into former President Trump, an anti-Catholic memo that identified traditional Catholics as potential ""terrorists,"" and activities during the pandemic to flag so-called misinformation on social media.

The FBI has contested GOP allegations and maintained its law enforcement operations are not influenced by politics. But the bureau's denials have not quieted its critics.

""The FBI labels parents as domestic terrorists, targets pro-lifers, and wages a war against conservative Americans. Their punishment? $200 MILLION for a new headquarters in this 'minbus,'"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo. ""Vote NO.""

HOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

In November, the Biden administration announced Greenbelt, a Washington, D.C., suburb, as the home for a new FBI facility to replace the crumbling J. Edgar Hoover Building, which is blocks away from the White House.

The GSA, which manages the government's real estate portfolio, said that Greenbelt site about 13 miles northeast of Washington was the cheapest one with the best access to public transit.

Lawmakers approved $375 million for the headquarters project in a government funding bill last year. Rep Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., had put forward an amendment to strip that funding from the fiscal 2023 bill, but was unsuccessful.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., welcomed the additional $200 million for the FBI in a statement Thursday, calling the new building in Prince George's County one of his ""top priorities.""

""This funding that I worked to secure within our FSGG appropriations bill is another critical step in moving forward with the new headquarters in Greenbelt,"" said Van Hollen, chairman of the Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee, in a statement to Roll Call.

The United States, along with several other countries, suspended funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in January after Israel alleged that 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza had participated in the Hamas cross-border attack on October 7. , proposed by Republicans as part of a $1.2 trillion government spending package, extends the funding moratorium for at least another year.

UNRWA has become a de facto affiliate of Hamas, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said in a speech on the House floor Friday, echoing claims by the Israeli government, which has long criticized the agency. Passage of this bill means that no additional American taxpayer dollars will be used to fund this deeply flawed organization.

U.N. officials vehemently deny the claims, and Israel has not publicly disclosed any evidence to support its claims about the involvement of UNRWA workers in the attack or its claims that the group was infiltrated. The UN secretary-general has launched an independent investigation and intends to publish its findings next month. Nonetheless, the consequences of these allegations have been far-reaching.

UNRWA, established in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the creation of the State of Israel, now administers most government-type services, including schools, health care, food and housing assistance to millions of people. these refugees and their descendants have spread to Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.

The European Commission, Canada, Australia and Sweden unfrozen their contributions to UNRWA this month. But U.S. contributions, which last year totaled $422 million, typically make up about 30 percent of UNRWA's budget, according to the organization. Cutting those resources now, when more than a million Gazans are on the brink of starvation, could be catastrophic, officials say. More than 32,000 people have been killed during nearly six months of Israeli bombardment, according to local health authorities.

It's the equivalent of a government shutdown here, said Bill Deere, director of UNRWA's Washington office. I don't know what will happen, but I can tell you that it cannot be good for regional stability if we remove the last vestiges of hope for millions of people.

Some Democrats who voted against the spending bill cited cuts to UNRWA among their top concerns. Others, who said they voted for the bill because it contained critical funding for the U.S. government, also expressed concerns about the potential impact it could have in Gaza.

Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who earlier this month held a briefing with UNRWA officials in an effort to end the ban on financing, described it as unacceptable.

Denying funding to UNRWA is tantamount to denying food to starving people and restricting medical supplies to injured civilians, he said in a statement.

Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colorado) said Friday that his already deep concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the Israeli military's aggressive pursuit of the war have only grown since he received this morning This is a classified briefing from US intelligence officials.

There is no other entity capable of transporting and distributing aid in the quantities needed to prevent famine in Gaza, he said of UNRWA.

Many Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that Hamas, whose members are believed to be hiding among civilians, was solely responsible for the deaths in Gaza.

Other members of the Republican Party have argued that other charities operating in Gaza could take over from UNRWA in the absence of US funding.

I have been pushing for a ban on UNRWA for years, said Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

There are all kinds of NGOs that can distribute aid to Gaza, Risch said. Anyone who claims otherwise is not working in the same field as me, in the field of foreign relations, he added.

Deere, of UNRWA's Washington office, said such statements are simply not based in reality. Other organizations in Gaza have only a small fraction of the personnel that UNRWA has, he said, adding that they do not have the experience and do not have the acceptance of community.

Without U.S. funding, UNRWA expects a shortfall of about $350 million this year unless other countries make up the loss, Deere said. That will mean less food aid, job losses and the closure of schools and clinics in poor Palestinian refugee camps across the region, including in deeply unstable Lebanon.

UNRWA has approximately 30,000 employees in the Middle East. Right now, we can run payroll through May, Deere said. But we were going to have to live here month after month.

We store things in our warehouses. Our trucks are used for distribution, Deere said, describing the agency's footprint. The World Health Organization can provide the vaccines, but ultimately it is the UNRWA nurse who vaccinates the child.

As Rep. Clay Higgins walked toward the House floor to vote on a $1.2 trillion government funding bill on Friday, the Louisiana Republican explained why his ""earmarks"" couldn't get him to vote yes.

""Ultimately, I don't control what the final language of the total funding bill will be,"" said Higgins. ""When I cast a vote on a bill, it has to be reflective of my core principles.""

Higgins voted against the bill, despite securing $2.3 million in federal funding for an emergency operations center at the port in Morgan City, Louisiana.

He was one of 20 House members -- 15 Republicans and 5 Democrats -- who voted against Friday's government funding bill despite securing so-called ""earmarks,"" known officially as congressionally directed spending.

Earmarks, which allow lawmakers to funnel spending toward specific projects in their districts, are controversial. Republicans banned them in 2011 amid accusations of fraud and waste, but Democrats brought them back in 2021. One argument in favor of earmarks is that they make high-stakes legislation easier to pass, providing lawmakers a stake in major bills and giving leadership a way to corral votes.

But recent votes show that there are limits to that logic.

Friday's bill encompassed roughly 70% of federal government funding, including the Pentagon, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies.

The other 30% was contained in a separate funding bill passed roughly two weeks ago, but that bill contained far more earmarks, especially for House members. Nonetheless, 42 House members who secured earmarks voted against it anyway, 40 of whom were Republicans.

The government funding bill, a compromise hashed out between the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House, barely passed with the required two-thirds majority on Friday. Both progressives and Republicans found reasons to oppose it.

Republicans protested that the bill did not include certain hardline immigration-related policy provisions, that culture war ""riders"" had been stripped from the compromise legislation, and as always, that the federal government is spending too much money.

Ultimately, most of the GOP conference voted against the bill, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is now threatening to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over it.

22 Democrats, the vast majority of whom are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, voted against the bill in protest of increased military funding, increased funding for border enforcement measures, and a one-year ban on funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a key provider of aid to Palestinians, particularly in Gaza.

That included Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the caucus, who voted against the bill despite securing $1.3 million for seismic structural upgrades at the Seattle Public Library.

""We are consistently rewarding waste, fraud, and abuse in the Pentagon by providing them with a larger budget year after year,"" Jayapal said in a statement.

The prohibition was one of many side issues included in the mammoth $1.2 trillion package to fund the government through September, which passed early Saturday shortly after a midnight deadline.

As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a conservative Christian, scrambled for votes to get the bill passed in his chamber, he ""boasted"" of the Pride flag ban as a reason his party should support the bill, the Daily Beast reported.

The White House said Saturday it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban on flying the rainbow flag, which celebrates the movement for LGBTQ equality.

The White House said that while it had not been able to block the flag proposal, it was ""successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation.""

The law signed by Biden says that no US funding can be used to ""fly or display a flag over a facility of the United States Department of State"" other than US or other government-related flags, or flags supporting prisoners of war, missing-in-action soldiers, hostages and wrongfully imprisoned Americans.

But while such flags may not be flown ""over"" US embassies, it does not speak to displaying them elsewhere on embassy grounds or inside offices, the Biden camp has argued.

""It will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride,"" the White House said, referencing the month, usually in June, when LGBTQ parades and other events are held.

The Biden administration has strongly embraced LGBTQ rights. In a sharp change from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not only allowed but encouraged US missions to fly the rainbow flag during Pride month.

Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, ordered that only the US flag fly from embassy flagpoles.

In 2015, former president Barack Obama's administration lit up the White House in rainbow colors -- delighting liberals and infuriating some conservatives -- as it celebrated the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage across the United States.

obust investment activity and strengthening private consumption demand is driving growth in the Indian economy amidst the sluggish global growth, according to the Finance Ministry's monthly review released on Friday.

The strong demand is evident from indicators like burgeoning air passenger traffic and sale of passenger vehicles, rising digital payments, improved consumer confidence and expectations of a normal monsoon, the report states.

Increased demand for residential properties in tier-2 and tier-3 cities augers well for furthering construction activity. Non-farm employment has revived, improving the capacity to absorb the labour leaving agriculture. The ascent of manufacturing sector employment is expected to be marked by upscaling of enterprises and sunrise sectors emerging as catalysts for generating quality employment, the report points out.

India's inflation outlook for the upcoming months is positive. Core inflation is trending downwards, indicating a broad-based moderation in price pressures. The pick-up in summer sowing is likely to help reduce food prices, the report states.

On the external front, the narrowing merchandise trade deficit and the rising net services receipts are expected to result in an improvement in the current account balance in FY24.

In FY25, however, the current account deficit will bear watching. An increase in domestic household savings will be necessary to finance private sector capital formation in the economy, the report states.

Improving global investor confidence on India has started reflecting in foreign portfolio investment flows. The announcement by Bloomberg that India would be included in its bond index from January 2025 should bolster inflows, buoyed by the fiscal prudence that the government has demonstrated over the years. Bond investors will base their investment decisions based on their perception of its persistence. On the whole, India looks positively towards the dawn of FY25, it adds.

This initiative to allocate shares directly to its users, which were previously held by leading venture capitalists like Paradigm, contributes significantly to the democratizing investment dynamics of the digital age.

ContentsWhat Does This Move Mean?A New Era in User Engagement and InvestmentThe Role of Paradigm and the Future of Web3 Social Platforms What Does This Move Mean?

Friend.tech's groundbreaking move has the potential to reshape the ownership and investment paradigm in the technology industry, beyond just being a social platform. Users will no longer just be active participants of the platform but will also become stakeholders who directly invest in its success.

With its innovative approach, Friend.tech is strengthening the sense of community by distributing shares to its users. It also increases the loyalty users feel towards the platform. This step will not only expand a platform's user base but will also encourage users to show more commitment, supporting long-term sustainable growth.

Friend.tech's decision to distribute shares came as a result of a critical agreement where venture capitalists like Paradigm agreed to waive their rights to sell tokens to users. This agreement enables Friend.tech to move towards a more user-centric ownership model where users are the owners of the platform and become stakeholders who directly invest in its success.

A New Era in User Engagement and Investment

Friend.tech's latest move could open up new avenues in user interaction and investment. Offering users control over tokens and the opportunity to receive company shares, this step paves the way for a more inclusive and equitable model in the field of technology entrepreneurship.

This change challenges traditional venture capital models and opens new horizons for user participation and investment in the technology sector. Users can now directly influence the future of the platform and contribute to a more collaborative and transparent environment.

The Role of Paradigm and the Future of Web3 Social Platforms

Paradigm's involvement in this initiative is quite remarkable. Known for investing in innovative technology ventures, Paradigm's desire to distribute shares to users signals a rise in more decentralized and user-focused business models.

This situation could encourage other venture capitalists and technology companies to explore similar strategies and could lay the groundwork for a more democratic environment in the technology and Web3 sectors.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Almost halfway into the fiscal year, the president's signature ends a months-long saga of Congress struggling to secure a permanent budget resolution and instead passing stopgap measures, nearly averting government shutdowns.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement. ""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted.""

The weekend budget deal slid in just under the wire before the Friday midnight funding deadline, as has been typical this fiscal year with eleventh-hour disagreements derailing near-complete deals.

The Senate passed the budget in a 74-24 vote early yesterday morning, technically two hours after the deadline due to last-minute disagreements. However, the White House said that it would not begin official shutdown operations since a deal had ultimately been secured and only procedural actions remained.

The House passed its own vote on Friday morning after a week of scrambling to reconcile a lingering sticking point: funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which the White House took issue with last weekend. The White House's qualms delayed the negotiation process further, just as legislators were preparing to release the legislative text of the budget proposal.

This trillion-dollar tranche of six appropriation bills will fund agencies related to defence, financial services, homeland security, health and human services and more. Congress approved $459 billion for the first six appropriations bills earlier in March, which related to agencies that were less partisan and easier to negotiate.

With the government finally funded for the rest of the fiscal year, House Speaker Mike Johnson has cleared his plate of at least one looming issue.

That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the U.S.-Mexico border.

This has long concerned European officials, as they look across the Atlantic and see blocked funds and the potential return of Donald Trump.

This is a question that the European Union is trying to answer. At a European Council summit this week, the bloc agreed to explore new ways of raising money for Ukraine, including increasing debt on financial markets and, controversially, using profits from Russian assets frozen.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said there was an openness, at least on our side, to new avenues of financing, and added emphatically that Europe cannot wait for the United States to take a decision.

However, the leaders did not agree to provide new funds for weapons. This could be a problem.

Ukraine's urgent need for weapons is becoming more and more acute. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly told his Western allies that the biggest challenge the country currently faces is an arms deficit that has allowed Russia to take advantage.

It would be unfair to accuse the EU of not doing everything possible to deal with Ukraine. Despite public disagreements among the 27 member states over topics such as sending tanks and whether the money should come directly from the EU budget, the bloc as a whole has sent more money to Kiev than in the United States, according to the Ukraine Support Tracker of the Kiel Institute.

However, the same tracker also shows that only $5.6 billion of the EU's total $85 billion was specifically allocated to military aid, compared to $2.2 billion for aid humanitarian and $77.1 billion for financial aid.

And with $60 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine tied up in Congress for the near future, it's not immediately clear who might fill that funding gap.

This is where the central question of whether Europe can truly replace the United States becomes complicated.

Some European officials like to present this issue as a purely economic one. The most recent World Bank data puts Russia's GDP at $2.24 trillion, compared to the EU's $16.75 trillion.

On paper, this means that Europe can hypothetically outlast Russia if the war turns into a war of economic attrition. Or more crudely: yes, Europe has the money to bridge the American gap.

The difficulty lies in how this works politically. The EU is made up of 27 sovereign states, all of which have independent foreign policies. Some are members of NATO, others are not and are officially neutral. Some are comfortable with the idea of buying American weapons and sending them to Ukraine for the specific purpose of killing Russian soldiers, others are not. Some are geographically close to Russia and fear that the war will spill over to their borders, others are protected by kilometers of territory separating them from Moscow and have maintained good economic relations with Russia for decades.

During the war, European thinking evolved. Diplomats and officials say that early in the conflict, Brussels' role was understood as providing financial assistance for things like maintaining basic state functions and welcoming refugees, while states -United would take care of the problem. weapons.

It is undeniable that the EU is taking defense more seriously. She recently unveiled a plan to finally build a European defense industry that could rival that of the United States in the future. But even this long-term project, still far from being a reality, poses uncomfortable questions for member states. Should EU money be spent outside the bloc? Where should factories be built? What type of relationship should procurement plans have with initiatives already carried out by NATO?

That's all for the long term: In the short term, Ukraine urgently needs weapons. CNN reported last week that Russia produces three times as many artillery shells as the United States and Europe combined for use in Ukraine.

An initiative led by the Czech Republic - supported by 17 other EU member states - has been set up outside EU structures to purchase ammunition on international markets to be sent to Ukraine.

The advantage of not being an official EU plan means they can move forward much more quickly and don't have to worry about their fellow member states, mainly Hungary, which has closer relations with Russia than the rest of the EU, veto or water down the plans.

The Czech initiative has already purchased 300,000 artillery shells and they are expected to arrive in Ukraine in June. The Ukrainians, of course, are delighted with this initiative, but also recognize that it will not plug the hole created by the United States.

Earlier this month, Ukraine's foreign minister said: ""The Czech initiative is great, but it is far from enough. If, in addition to the Czech initiative, two other initiatives are implemented this year, Russian troops in Ukraine will face greater problems on the front line. Some saw it as a reference to the blocked American package.

So, can Europe fill the financial void left by Washington DC in Ukraine?

The answer is yes, Europe has the means. The biggest unknown is whether she will have the will.

Eastern European officials stress the importance of convincing their counterparts that Ukrainian security is the same as European security. Although the former Soviet states are often portrayed as hawks in Western Europe, they argue, quite reasonably, that if Russia invaded NATO territory, the bombs would likely fall on them, not Athens or Rome , For example.

But this would affect all European countries, especially those in NATO. And countries that share borders with Russia almost universally share the view that the only way to ensure that Russia does not expand its aggression is to make NATO so strong that an attack would be unthinkable even for Russia. President Vladimir Putin.

It's hard enough to argue for a dramatic increase in defense spending even as there is a war on Europe's borders. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed last month's announcement that 18 of the allies would spend 2% of their GDP on defense. This is a dramatic improvement from a decade ago, when only three NATO countries met the minimum threshold. But this means that even in a crisis like Ukraine, more than a third fail to achieve this goal.

The longer the war drags on, the more fatigue risks setting in. The greater the pressures on national budgets for things like public services and pensions, the harder it becomes to justify giving money to another country to fight a war.

And it is exactly at this point that European thinking can go two ways: ensuring that Ukraine beats Russia for the sake of the continent as a whole, or asking: what does this have to do with We ?

Yes, Europe can fill the void left by the United States - and, in some ways, that is exactly what it is trying to do. But it all depends on whether Ukraine's biggest allies in Europe can continue to win the battle.

As one of the 202 community projects scheduled across the commonwealth, the town of Weymouth will use $1,383,069 of new funding to reinforce the seawall and to update infrastructure on Fort Point Road.

""I am proud to have helped secure over $1.3 million dollars of federal funding to help the Town of Weymouth update the coastal resilience infrastructure on Fort Point Road,"" said Rep. Lynch. ""Unfortunately, there have been many roadway loses and damages to properties around this area due to rising sea levels for quite some time. This critical project will help protect surrounding homeowners and businesses by replacing the existing sea wall to ensure it's able to withstand anticipated levels of waves and potential flooding due to climate change.

The funding was granted as part of the Second Consolidated Appropriations Bill. It will be signed into law by President Biden.

The vote for the package of spending bills was 74-24.

Mike Dunleavy's veto of a $200 million education bill.

Many rural districts say they now face developing budgets for the coming year while experiencing spikes in operating expenses, record staff vacancies and mounting deferred maintenance costs.

The education bill -- Senate Bill 140, which included the largest boost to public school funding in state history -- could have helped rural districts avoid painful choices they are now considering for next year, including eliminating sports teams, teacher and staff positions and student nutrition programs, administrators said.

In Northwest Alaska, this could mean losing a beloved activity: basketball. The Northwest Arctic Borough School District is considering saving more than $1.7 million by cutting sports and other activities, one of their many ideas for balancing the budget deficit, according to Margaret Hansen, president of the district's Board of Education.

In Sleetmute, a village in Western Alaska along the upper Kuskokwim River, the lack of funding means putting off replacing the community's partially condemned school with a roof in imminent danger of collapsing, according to Kuspuk School District superintendent Madeline Aguillard. Students are still attending classes in a portion of the school building that's safe because they have nowhere else to go, said Aguillard.

Senate Bill 140 initially passed in both chambers of the Legislature with broad bipartisan support. It included a $680 increase to the Base Student Allocation -- an amount that many school administrators said was just half of the amount needed to address their operating needs and keep pace with inflation.

[Alaska lawmakers see no clear path to a new school funding bill]

The governor said he vetoed the bill because it did not include some of his priorities, including teacher bonuses and provisions for charter schools. The veto override failed as many school districts around the state were developing their budgets for the coming school year.

In a statement, a Dunleavy spokesperson said there's still time to pass an education bill this year, and that the governor ""has stated repeatedly that he supports increasing funding for education, especially given inflationary pressures. At the same time, funding should be targeted to where it will have the greatest impact.""

Administrators with a number of rural districts reached for this story said that without the promise of additional money, they will struggle to cover even basic operating costs. Many of them rely solely on state funding to support their schools.

Most school districts around the state have reported increases in operating costs and growing budget deficits over the last several years. In rural Alaska, the cost of living is already astronomical -- and growing.

In the Northwest Arctic, expenses for essentials such as heating, electricity, shipping and food have surged by 28% since 2017, the last time Alaska's public schools received a significant funding boost, district superintendent Terri Walker said.

""Because of subsistence and our culture and background, we're resilient and able to continue living here, but it's so hard with the prices. They are 60% higher than Anchorage, you know,"" said Hansen, the Board of Education president. ""The freight costs are so, so high.""

In the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the Yupiit School District is also facing rising costs of utilities -- including water, sewer and electricity, according to district superintendent Scott Ballard.

""We're paralyzed by the lack of systematic funding,"" he said. ""It costs 50% more now than it did five years ago just to keep the lights on, just to keep up with the cost of health care.""

Ballard said a BSA increase of $680 ""wouldn't even cover our deficit for next year."" Amid continued uncertainty in the Legislature, Ballard said the district was faced with planning for no additional funding.

""We can't make plans. We can't hire teachers. We can't offer contracts for vacant positions. We can't order essential equipment that we need for next year that has to come by barge,"" he said.

The Kuspuk School District experienced ""an incredible hike"" in electricity costs last year, superintendent Aguillard said.

To save money on heating, the district considered switching to wood-burning stoves -- ""but that depends on a huge amount of manpower,"" Aguillard said. ""And frankly, we don't have that.""

[After education bill veto override fails, major cuts to Anchorage schools back on table]

Petersburg School District administrators are not planning on any funding increases this year either, superintendent Erica Kludt-Painter said, especially after the governor vetoed half of a one-time public education funding boost last June.

""At this point, we are budgeting for flat funding,"" Kludt-Painter said. ""I will not make an assumption about any funding increase at this point, especially not based on what happened last year and also now what's happening this year.""

Because the district also has to deal with rising fixed costs -- shipping costs in the case of the Petersburg School District, located on an island -- administrators are now forced to look into cutting staff and programs, Kludt-Painter said.

""And that means kids are impacted,"" Kludt-Painter said. ""It is not the right direction.""

In the emailed statement, a spokesman for Gov. Dunleavy said, ""No school district -- rural or urban -- has ever known the exact amount of funding they will receive from the state until the operating and capital budgets are passed and signed into law. That process is usually completed in June. This year is no different. What was different this year was that the House Majority decided to start discussing education from the very beginning of the session rather than waiting until the final days.""

Cuts to staff, student nutrition and basketball?

Like urban Alaska districts, many rural districts are considering upping the student-teacher ratio, increasing class sizes, combining grade levels and cutting positions and programs.

Northwest Arctic Borough School District officials are thinking of reducing funding for sports and student activities, which include volleyball, track, Eskimo Olympics, and basketball.

""The main one is basketball,"" Hansen said. ""Our students -- that's what drives them to go to school, you know, sometimes the motivation they need to stay in school and to be healthy.""

The Kuspuk School District is considering cutting multiple staff positions, combining some grade levels and cutting the cross-country team -- a decision that superintendent Aguillard said felt painful to even consider.

""I absolutely don't want to cut any opportunity for students,"" she said, adding that she continually hears from families and the community how important sports are. The district currently offers no electives for its students, and employs just two administrators.

Years of flat funding has meant the district has struggled to hire enough staff for each of its schools; about 20% of its teaching positions are vacant, Aguillard said. She said she's had to rely on remote instructors in some cases.

""Online learning is quite expensive, so this doesn't save any money,"" she said. ""We really want in-person, live teachers in our classrooms.""

The Yupiit School District is ""looking at every item in our budget to see if there's a place where we can save money,"" superintendent Ballard said. ""But when 80% of our budget goes to salaries and benefits, what do you do?"" he said.

Also on the table as a potential cut is a program that helps provide free breakfasts and lunches to all students, Ballard said. The federal government reimburses some -- but not all -- of the cost of that program.

The district spent more than $300,000 of its general fund last year on that program, and Ballard said the cut would be hard on many students and their families.

""That's a big incentive for a lot of students to come to school,"" he said.

A recent, yearlong backlog at the Alaska Division of Public Assistance caused many families around the state to go months without federal food stamp and other public assistance benefits. The crisis took a particular toll in rural Alaska, which generally has fewer food banks and pantries to fill the gap.

""It's so important for them to come to school and have a meal and be ready to learn,"" said Hansen with the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, which she said is also considering cutting the free meal program.

Depleting emergency funds

School districts are also eyeing their emergency funds. In rural Alaska, that means spending money reserved for fixing broken infrastructure and dealing with weather emergencies -- things that come up.

Last year, the Northwest Arctic Borough School District had to spend close to $1 million to fix water and sewer leaks and address failing fire panel systems, Hansen said.

Now administrators might have to use all of the fund balance, $4.7 million, to cover their budget costs, Hansen said.

""What are we going to do when we have an emergency?"" Hansen said. ""Those situations are real, you know. ... Not only do we have to teach our children, but we have to operate and maintain the facilities that were built many years ago.""

Dillingham's school district is also planning to dip into its emergency savings for the first time in years in order to avoid cuts and still be able to offer raises to teachers, said Amy Brower, the district's superintendent.

Rural school administrators said they were thankful to the lawmakers who had advocated for an increase in public school funding, but that they were deeply frustrated the education bill did not pass.

""It seems to me that our state government has forgotten the people it serves. It's our children and Alaska's future that's being jeopardized,"" Hansen said. ""It's so hard to believe anymore when some of those legislators voted against (overriding the veto) but say they're for education. It's so disheartening.""

The way some legislators spoke about student performance also drew criticism from some rural school officials. During floor discussions prior to the veto override, several Republican lawmakers who supported the veto questioned investing money in schools with Alaska's low test scores.

[Facing deadline, Alaska House advances bill to increase rural school internet speeds]

Ballard with the Yupiit School District said standardized testing was not the best or only way to measure student achievement, particularly in rural Alaska.

""We're trying to design a system that is more aligned with Native ways of learning, that's embedded in Native values, culture and language,"" he said. ""And when you don't have a system that measures or values that, then what you have is people in Juneau or in other parts of Alaska who basically look at one dataset -- standardized test scores -- and say, 'Oh my gosh, these kids all over Alaska are not thriving, and they're not doing well.' And I think that's a mistake.""

Hansen pointed out that the way the districts' performance is evaluated is not taking into account the technological disparities.

""It can take days for our students to take the test to which we cater determination on how well our students are learning,"" Hansen said.

Aguillard said her students frequently get kicked out of the online system mid-test due to lagging internet connections, and are often forced to start their tests over multiple times.

""How can we talk about accountability when 100% of standardized tests are given online, but we don't have reliable internet access in our schools?"" she said.

Despite the frustration that many administrators said they were feeling, many said they were still heartened to see such impassioned pleas for improvements to public education in the Legislature.

""These last few years, it's hard to feel that our kids aren't being valued,"" Kludt-Painter said, but added that a lot of driven and educated people in the state ""remain committed to providing high-quality education to kids.""

""There is still time to pass an increase to the BSA this session,"" a Dunleavy spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Education will certainly be funded this year.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.1686274509803921,448928536,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

""The historic ban on US funding to UNRWA that passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and can not be part of the solution,"" Katz wrote on social media.

The US House and Senate voted late Friday night to approve a 1.2 trillion dollar spending bill to fund more than half of the government through September, but the bill included a suspension of funding for at least a year for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which provides services to nearly 6 million Palestinians in various countries and is the main humanitarian actor in the war-torn Gaza Strip.

The legislation, which averted a government shutdown, was the subject of intense haggling between Democrats and Republicans.

It includes the 3.8 billion dollars the US sends to Israel each year, but says that ""funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act or other acts (...) may not be used for a contribution, grant, or other payment"" to UNRWA ""until March 25, 2025.""

Republicans hailed the defunding of UNRWA as a capitulation by Democrats, and progressives in both chambers were unhappy with the move.

""Now my colleagues are pushing legislation to send more American taxpayer dollars to the apartheid government of Israel and stop funding UNRWA, the vital organization that provides desperately needed food and humanitarian aid to starving Palestinians,"" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, said from the House floor on Thursday when the bill containing the provision was introduced.

The US stopped funding UNRWA in late January after Israel notified the agency that 12 of its 30,000 employees had allegedly been involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.

Washington had been UNRWA's largest donor, providing the agency with between 300 and 400 million dollars a year.

Other countries, including the agency's other major donors, announced they were withdrawing their funds, resulting in a 450 million dollar cut from the agency's operating budget, which amounts to about 800 million dollars a year, amid the emergency response in Gaza.

However, countries such as Canada, Sweden, Australia or the European Union - which only temporarily froze funding - have announced in recent weeks their intention to resume contributions to UNRWA in light of the inconsistency of the evidence presented by Israel to support its accusations.

Other countries, such as Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, have maintained their allocations and even announced additional funds to soften the blow.

The agency's director, Philippe Lazzarini, said on March 4 in his first address to the UN General Assembly since the scandal that Tel Aviv has never provided conclusive evidence of its workers' ties to Hamas, claiming that ""there is a political decision here to eliminate UNRWA.

UNRWA also claimed in an unpublished report seen by many media outlets last month that Israeli forces tortured a number of its staff in Gaza to force them to admit links to Hamas.

Meanwhile, Israel has widened its accusations against UNRWA, saying Hamas's infiltration of the agency goes much deeper.

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on March 4 that of the 13,000 UNRWA workers in Gaza, more than 450 are ""military operatives"" of Hamas and other armed groups, and that Israel has shared this information with the United Nations.

And a report by the Israeli Embassy in Spain released on Friday said that some 480 UNRWA employees in Gaza are members of armed wings of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, 1,650 belong to the political movement, and more than 2,130, about 17% of the agency's staff in the enclave, have active links to ""terrorist"" groups.

An investigation by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services is currently underway into Israel's allegations that 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7 attacks.

This is separate from the independent review group headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, which is conducting a comprehensive analysis of whether UNRWA has a significant number of mechanisms and procedures in place to ensure compliance with the humanitarian principle of neutrality.

The White House announced the signing on Saturday after the U.S. Senate approved the package in the early morning hours. That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower individuals to achieve financial wellbeing and resilience.

In South Africa, the youth confront a myriad of challenges, with high unemployment rates being a prominent concern.

Last month, Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke revealed a 0.9 percentage point increase in the youth unemployment rate, soaring from 43.4% in Q3: 2023 to 44.3% in Q4: 2023.

For those fortunate enough to secure employment, grappling with record levels of inflation has become a harsh reality.

Despite these challenges, a study conducted by Nedbank in July uncovered a positive trend among young South Africans regarding savings habits.

The study revealed that 68% of young adults save monthly, with an additional 7% saving weekly. Furthermore, the research highlighted that 89% of respondents utilise various informal savings methods.

These range from accumulating grocery vouchers or stamps for end-of-year expenses to participating in stokvels or storing cash at home, demonstrating a proactive approach to financial management.

Despite these encouraging trends, the study also unveiled a strong desire among participants for comprehensive knowledge on ways to grow their money.

A staggering 78% expressed the need for enhanced financial education.

This year's Global Money Week theme, Protect your money, secure your future, emphasises the importance of adopting a responsible and informed approach to personal finances.

It underscores safe money management practices and raises awareness about potential risks in the financial sector, such as scams, fraud and data privacy concerns.

Nozipho Van Heerden, the creator of the YouTube channel Talking Money With Nozi, offers valuable insights for those embarking on their savings and investment journey.

Van Heerden emphasises the significance of starting by examining one's budget to identify areas for potential savings. This includes scrutinising expenses to eliminate wastage and increase disposable income.

She advises individuals to negotiate with employers for salary hikes, provided they can demonstrate value through their contributions to the company.

Alternatively, upskilling through courses or pursuing side hustles are viable strategies for augmenting income.

Regarding savings targets, Van Heerden recommends starting with a minimum of 10% of one's income, gradually increasing this percentage as financial circumstances permit. She stresses the importance of consistency in saving to cultivate a savings habit effectively.

In terms of investments, Van Heerden highlights the basics of enrolling in pension or provident funds through employment as foundational steps. She advises against withdrawing from these funds when changing jobs and encourages individuals to consider tax-free savings accounts for long-term investment growth.

People can also look at exchange-traded funds or unit trusts; that's another way of investing. Van Heerden says:",news24.com,news,news24,Sthembiso Lebuso,0.2705882352941176,448928392,1,https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8174/8057f704a69b40d7b137f988635c2650.jpg,

In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 43.98 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 44.11 is the first level of support below 45.32, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 44.11 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If 45.72 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy JEF just slightly over 45.72, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 45.59 in case the stock turns against the trade. 45.72 is the first level of resistance above 45.32, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 45.72, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of JEF if it tests 45.72 with a downside target of 44.63. We should have a stop loss in place at 45.85 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 45.72, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 45.45 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy JEF just slightly over 45.45, with an upside target of 45.72. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 45.34 in case the stock turns against the trade. 45.45 is the first level of resistance above 45.32, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 45.45, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of JEF if it tests 45.45 with a downside target of 44.63.

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Biden -- who had the bill delivered to him in Wilmington, Delaware, Saturday -- said in a statement that while the package is a ""compromise,"" it is ""good news for the American people.""

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in the statement, adding that ""it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans"" while investing in child care, cancer research and mental health.

The president also touted how the final package included ""resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include.""

Biden used the statement to urge Congress to pass additional legislation, saying its their ""work isn't finished."" He called on the House to ""pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests"" and urged both chambers to pass the bipartisan border security bill his administration has negotiated, calling it ""the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done,"" Biden added.

The signing of the legislation marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

This legislation is the second part of a two-tiered government funding process. A separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

The extensive capital expansion programme -- which was worth US$125 million in the past two financial years, combined with a further US$32 million during the interim period to December 31, 2023 -- spread across eight business units as the group sought to maintain its dominance across the market.

Innscor's operations span across various sectors of the economy. The group engages in fast food services and the manufacture, distribution and retailing of household commodities and fresh produce.

It operates through segments: mill-bake, protein, light manufacturing and head office services.

The Mill-Bake Segment comprises the Bakery Division, National Foods, Nutrimaster, and the group's non-controlling interests in Profeeds; while the Protein Segment comprises Colcom, Irvine's, Associated Meat Packers, Texas Meats and Texas Chicken.

The Light Manufacturing Segment involves the production of stockfeeds, edible oils, bakers' fats and the sale of other general household products. It is also into the production, processing and marketing of pork and related food products; and the manufacture and retail of household goods and appliances.

Additionally, it is involved in the production of chicken, table eggs and day-old chicks; down-packaging and manufacture of grocery products such as rice, candles and beverages; and the production of a variety of bags for packaging.

""Despite the macroeconomic environment, the group delivered pleasing volume growth across most business units against the comparative period, driven by a sustained recovery across the mill-bake value chain, supported by firm demand in the protein, beverage and light manufacturing segments, which all benefitted from investment activity targeted at capacity building, product extensions and venturing into new categories.

""In the six-month period under review, the group has also been actively focused on building capacity within the sales and distribution functions of consumer-facing business units,"" Mr Addington Chinake, the group's independent non-executive chairperson, said in a statement of the financials.

He said the group has remained resilient in ensuring its business models are optimised in the prevailing trading environment, supported by a drive to ensure economies of scale are unlocked across the value chain, with the objective of attaining affordable consumer pricing for all its products.

In the 2022 financial year, the group invested US$70 million on various capital projects. The additional US$56 million for the following year (FY 2023) was spent on bread delivery trucks, while another US$10 million was spent on the pasta and biscuits plant at National Food Limited.

About US$8 million was spent on beverage equipment, while the Colcom factory upgrade and the Bulawayo feed mill will cost US$7 million each.

The table egg facility upgrade and innovations at National Foods also got US$5 million each, while the Kwekwe dairy farm received US$4 million.

Innscor also invested in Buffalo Brewing Company, and the group's entry into opaque beer has provided direct competition to Delta.

According to FBC Securities, Innscor remains well-positioned to navigate challenges presented by an uncertain global outlook and complexities in the local environment, in part due to its diversified product offering.

Additionally, it said the business operates in the consumer staples sector; therefore, demand for its products is largely sustainable even in times of an economic downturn. ""The group's overall volume trajectory remains strong, underpinned by its investment drive, with focus being deployed on expanding plant capacities, enhancing manufacturing capabilities and product extensions, as well as route-to-market initiatives that continue to be refined in order to drive volume into new markets,"" the firm said.

During the period under review, the group's revenue grew by 20,2 percent to US$480,4 million, with the growth underpinned by improved capacity utilisation across its core manufacturing entities.

Mr Chinake said this was supported by the introduction of new product categories, category extensions, route-to-market optimisation and an acute focus on pricing strategy to ensure affordability and convenience for the consumer.

He said during the period, the group has also invested considerably in the selling and distribution functions within certain key businesses, which have driven the volume and revenue performance for the group, albeit from a marginally higher cost base.

In its earning review for Innscor, IH Securities said the investments will allow the group further scope to generate revenue, as well as improve manufacturing processes and efficiencies.

""The capital expenditure programme is notably now at the tail end, paving the way for improved free cash flows in the medium term, as well as valuation. Given the current environment, management focus will continue to rest on optimising trading models,"" IH said.

The firm, however, noted that consumer liquidity in the remaining half of Innscor's financial year is projected to be constrained due to the ongoing El Niño-induced drought conditions and this will likely have a downside of slower volumes growth outside of the staples offering in the second half of 2024.

For the period under review, the Bakery Division recorded volume growth of 23,3 percent over the comparative period on account of consistent wheat pricing and innovative route-to-market initiatives, which saw the scaling up of country-wide express shops during the period under review, coupled with continued investment to replace the existing bread distribution fleet.

""The new state-of-the-art Bulawayo factory reached full capacity during the latter part of the period under review, unlocking production efficiencies and enhancing loaf quality and consistency in the Southern region.

""Investments that targeted further automation within the Harare operations were also recently commissioned,"" said Mr Chinake.

National Foods registered an aggregate volume growth of 3,4 percent over the comparative period, driven by a recovery in flour volumes and continued momentum in the stockfeed business.

""The stockfeed business unit volumes grew by 14 percent over the comparative period, supported by sustained demand in both the chicken and beef feed segments.""

The group's overall volumes within the maize business unit closed marginally behind the comparative period; however, demand for premium maize meals under the ""Pearlenta"" brand remained firm, with volumes closing at 7 percent ahead of the comparative period.

In the Beverage and other Light Manufacturing Segment at Prodairy, prior investments to expand capacity within the ""Revive"" dairy blend and ""Life"" steri milk categories drove overall volumes by 49 percent ahead of the comparative period.

The ""Life"" UHT milk category benefited from an increased raw milk supply and registered volume growth of 8 percent over the comparative period, while demand for maheu, also under the ""Revive"" brand, remained firm.

Probottlers aggregate volumes increased by 22 percent over the comparative period, driven by improved capacity utilisation within the ""Fizzi"" CSD category, where volumes closed at 20 percent ahead of the comparative period.

However, Innscor said the recently announced policy measures targeting amendments to value-added tax regulations, sugar tax and trading modalities, with the buoyant informal sector, have necessitated a sharp refocus on trading models across the group's business units and products.

Mr Chinake said notwithstanding the direct cost-push pressure arising from this regulatory shift, the group is focusing heavily on unlocking cost savings in both the bills of materials and operating cost lines, with the objective of ensuring that product pricing remains both affordable and convenient to the consumer and that volume momentum is maintained.

""The group remains hopeful that the authorities will pursue a pathway for implementing policies that encourage more market-determined outcomes,"" he said.",sundaymail.co.zw,news,Sunday Mail Zimbabwe,,0.1529411764705881,448927962,1,https://www.sundaymail.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/INNSCOR.jpg,

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

When they were finally released in January, the auditors resigned as it had been unable to confirm the existence of £46million of stock.

The accountants also warned that the company did not have formal commitments to receive additional funds from owners Jingye, which put its ability to keep trading at risk.

Unions are understood to be meeting the company - which is already three months late in publishing its 2022 accounts -within weeks and intend to question bosses about its financial health.

Any state funding will depend on Jingye committing to protect jobs and investing at least £1billion in the group by 2030, according to media reports. Ministers said in October 2022 they were in negotiations with steelmakers to secure the industry's future.

British Steel is the UK's second-largest producer and one of only two with traditional, but highly polluting, blast furnaces along with Indian-owned Tata Steel, which is set to receive a controversial £500 million government grant to switch the Port Talbot site to electric.

But a source said there were concerns that the Government may not want to reach an agreement with British Steel so close to the next General Election - given the backlash against Tata's proposals, which could come at a cost of more than 2,400 jobs across the UK.

British Steel said the talks had not stalled but remained ongoing. A spokesman said: 'In April we hope to receive planning permission to build Electric Arc Furnaces in Scunthorpe and Teesside, and we remain in talks with the Government about the challenges we face.

'We are committed... and need to reach an agreement quickly so we can achieve our ambitious goals, secure thousands of jobs and keep making the steel Britain needs for generations to come.'

The Department for Business and Trade said: 'We have offered a generous support package to British Steel, including more than £300million of investment for the company to cut emissions, help safeguard jobs and create a positive future for steel production.'

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defence and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (6:00 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security"".

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 per cent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 per cent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",jordantimes.com,news,Jordan Times,,0.1843137254901961,448927261,1,,spa-3422544

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Tucked in the massive funding bill signed Saturday by President Joe Biden is a provision banning the flying of LGBTQ Pride flags over US embassies, but the White House has vowed to work toward its repeal.

The prohibition was one of many side issues included in the mammoth $1.2 trillion package to fund the government through September, which passed early Saturday shortly after a midnight deadline.

As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a conservative Christian, scrambled for votes to get the bill passed in his chamber, he ""boasted"" of the Pride flag ban as a reason his party should support the bill, the Daily Beast reported.

The White House said Saturday it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban on flying the rainbow flag, which celebrates the movement for LGBTQ equality.

""Biden believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans,"" a White House statement said, adding that the president ""is committed to fighting for LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.""

The White House said that while it had not been able to block the flag proposal, it was ""successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation.""

The law signed by Biden says that no US funding can be used to ""fly or display a flag over a facility of the United States Department of State"" other than US or other government-related flags, or flags supporting prisoners of war, missing-in-action soldiers, hostages and wrongfully imprisoned Americans.

But while such flags may not be flown ""over"" US embassies, it does not speak to displaying them elsewhere on embassy grounds or inside offices, the Biden camp has argued.

""It will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride,"" the White House said, referencing the month, usually in June, when LGBTQ parades and other events are held.

The Biden administration has strongly embraced LGBTQ rights. In a sharp change from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not only allowed but encouraged US missions to fly the rainbow flag during Pride month.

Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, ordered that only the US flag fly from embassy flagpoles.

The race is on for Congress to pass the final spending package for the current budget year and push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. With spending set to expire for several key federal agencies at midnight Friday, the House and Senate are expected to take up a $1.2 trillion measure that combines six annual spending bills into one package.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came early Saturday, after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.___Associated Press congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro and staff writers Farnoush Amiri and Chris Megerian contributed to this report.",eastbaytimes.com,news,East Bay Times,Associated Press,0.192156862745098,448926841,1,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP24082513979428.jpg?w=640,

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came early Saturday, after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

In November 2023, corporate approvals were received to separate the company's India and GCC businesses into two distinct and stand-alone entities to unlock long-term value. Under the separation plan, a Fajr Capital-led consortium entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 65 percent stake in the company's GCC business. The plan was approved by the company's shareholders in January this year.

As a part of the completion process, the Fajr Capital-led consortium has obtained the necessary approvals from Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Competition. The integration of business operations in Qatar into the transaction perimeter of Aster DM Healthcare FZC has also been successfully completed.

The Moopen family will continue to lead and operate the GCC business retaining a 35 percent stake in the buyer entity. Existing shareholders will continue to remain with the listed Indian entity, Aster DM Healthcare Ltd.

Dr. Azad Moopen, founder and chairman, Aster DM Healthcare, said: ""The separation of Aster's India and GCC businesses will unlock the value and potential of both businesses and provide the needed impetus for the company to further strengthen its presence in both geographies. We are very near to closure and excited to embark on the next stage of growth.""

Alisha Moopen, managing director and group CEO, Aster GCC business, said: ""With most of the processes near closure and necessary approvals in place, we are almost at the closure of the transaction and ready to embark on the next stage of our growth journey, which would see us expand our presence in Saudi Arabia and further strengthen our footprint in UAE, Oman and Qatar. We are delighted to have Fajr Capital and its consortium partners in our journey and thankful to the authorities for their continued support.""

In the GCC, the company has plans to expand its Aster Pharmacy business in Saudi Arabia with 180 retail stores set to open within the next three to five years. This would be alongside the expansion of Aster Sanad Hospital in Riyadh with added bed-capacity to serve a larger population segment.

In the UAE, the company is all set to launch Medcare Royal Hospital, a 126-bed super specialty hospital in Al-Qusais, positioned to emerge as the destination for tertiary and quaternary care in a luxury setting, for local and international patients.",arab.news,news,Arab News,,0.2,448926575,1,https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/03/23/4287916-1426928321.png?itok=rk0065fF,

Several dozen members of California's congressional delegation, including a handful from Southern California, asked Gov. Gavin Newsom last week to prioritize investment in the space industry, part of a move among leaders responding to recent job cuts and funding shortfalls.

In their letter, 40 House members and the state's two senators emphasized the need for greater state leadership and continued investment, which they said will bring to California high-paying jobs and large economic growth.

""With the increased cadence in commercial, national security and civil space launch, there is not a better time to position California to be a global leader in the space economy,"" the lawmakers said.

Because the state is already home to several federal space facilities, including the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Los Angeles Air Force Base, NASA facilities like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center as well as a strong satellite manufacturing industry, lawmakers said: ""California is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing space economy.""

California has a rich heritage of spaceflight, said Madhu Thangavelu, a lecturer of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California. The state, instrumental in landing men on the moon in the space race, is home to offices or headquarters of several industry heavyweights, including Boeing, Northrop Grumman, NASA and SpaceX.

""In the past 10 years, we've seen the private space sector take off,"" said Thangavelu, also a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""This happened the most in Southern California, to be specific.""

""No other state could compete with California because of our heritage,"" he said. ""There's a whole culture around human spaceflight that exists in all of California.""

Since 2019, California has invested $625 million in more than 25 counties in the defense and space industry through various programs, said Newsom spokesperson Omar Rodriguez, including those that offer tax credits to businesses based in the state.

Some examples are California Competes, an income tax credit available to businesses that want to come to California or stay in the state; the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority, which offers a tax exclusion to manufacturers of products that reduce pollution and energy use; and the Employment Training Panel, a workforce training program that provides financial assistance to California businesses, said Rodriguez.

In 2022, California launched the California Space Industry Task Force, aimed at pursuing opportunities to ""harness future growth in the space industry,"" according to Newsom's office, through efforts like expanding aerospace research and working with universities to strengthen their career pipeline into the industry.

The task force convenes government and industry leaders regularly to strengthen commercial space industry in the state, said Rhys Williams, Newsom's chief deputy cabinet secretary.

Despite those efforts, said Thangavelu, companies have uprooted their headquarters or parts of their businesses from California, partly due to the state's heavy regulation of public and private companies as well as the high cost of doing business.

In response to the lawmakers, Williams said Newsom is ""committed to expanding the state's role in our nation's space ecosystem.""

""California's innovation is not limited to Earth,"" he said. ""California looks forward to working with state and federal leaders to continue growing and leading the nation's commercial space sector.""

Many of the lawmakers noted that they were motivated by a desire to preserve space industry jobs within their districts and California as a whole.

It was just last month when JPL in Pasadena laid off more than 500 people, about 8% of the lab's total staffing.

At the time, JPL Director Laurie Leshin, in breaking the news to the staff at JPL, wrote, ""These cuts are among the most challenging that we have had to make even as we have sought to reduce our spending in recent months.""

Leshin noted that the lab was waiting on Congress for funding for the much-publicized Mars Sample Return mission -- an effort to retrieve soil and rock samples collected by a Mars rover and return them to Earth for study. But officials were already under the gun to cut costs, leading to a hiring freeze, a reduction in some MSR mission contracts, budget cuts and elimination of some on-site contractors.

She noted that NASA previously told JPL to expect an MSR budget of $300 million, a 63% drop from the previous year.

When Congress passed last-minute funding bills earlier this month, Sen. Alex Padilla noted that the approved funding agreement that ""provides no less than $300 million in funding for the Mars Sample Return Program"" was ""a step in the right direction"" to ensure California's leading position in the industry.

But it didn't take the matter off local leaders' radars across Southern California.

""The issue is of particular importance to the thousands of aerospace jobs here in the San Fernando Valley,"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks. This point was echoed by fellow San Fernando Valley Rep. Tony Cárdenas of Panorama City.

""Seeing the respective successes of Texas and Florida's space ventures, I joined my California delegation colleagues to encourage Gov. Newsom to further expand efforts in our state,"" said Cárdenas. ""We know that California has valuable resources and talent that could outcompete others, so I'm supportive of state investments in our space industrial.""

And Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat who represents a district that has a wealth of private aerospace companies, said Orange County could benefit from increased state support.

""I'm proud to represent a thriving research community, which includes academic researchers at places like (UC Irvine) and local businesses that are building critical systems for the Artemis Space Program,"" she said, pointing to the NASA campaign that aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the moon.

""Orange County is a nationwide leader in driving innovation, and we have consistently benefited from bipartisan federal support,"" said Porter. ""Our community also needs partners at the state level, who will invest in our growing space economy to promote scientific advances and create jobs.""

A similar group of bipartisan lawmakers -- including Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank; Mike Garcia, R-Santa Clarita; and Judy Chu, D-Pasadena -- recently urged NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to commit at least $650 million to the Mars Sample Return Program.

Chu, along with Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican, have also restarted the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, which works to advance planetary science missions. The Planetary Society is a founding partner of the caucus.

In the letter to Nelson, signed by 23 representatives from California, they asked NASA to invest in the program to retain its workforce and ensure America remains the world leader in the race to Mars.

Several dozen members of California's congressional delegation, including a handful from Southern California, asked Gov. Gavin Newsom last week to prioritize investment in the space industry, part of a move among leaders responding to recent job cuts and funding shortfalls.

In their letter, 40 House members and the state's two senators emphasized the need for greater state leadership and continued investment, which they said will bring to California high-paying jobs and large economic growth.

""With the increased cadence in commercial, national security and civil space launch, there is not a better time to position California to be a global leader in the space economy,"" the lawmakers said.

Because the state is already home to several federal space facilities, including the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Los Angeles Air Force Base, NASA facilities like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center as well as a strong satellite manufacturing industry, lawmakers said: ""California is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing space economy.""

California has a rich heritage of spaceflight, said Madhu Thangavelu, a lecturer of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.

A US government shutdown has been averted after the Senate passed a $1.2trn spending package in a 2am vote 74-24. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Saturday. It will keep the federal government open until the end of fiscal year 2024 on 30 September.

The House of Representatives passed the spending package 286 to 134, surpassing the two-thirds majority needed. Calling it a ""betrayal of Republican voters"", a furious Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated the process to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done.""

- 'Our persistence has been worth it' -

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

- Speaker under pressure -

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The prohibition was one of many side issues included in the mammoth $1.2 trillion package to fund the government through September, which passed early Saturday shortly after a midnight deadline.

As Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a conservative Christian, scrambled for votes to get the bill passed in his chamber, he ""boasted"" of the Pride flag ban as a reason his party should support the bill, the Daily Beast reported.

The White House said Saturday it would seek to find a way to repeal the ban on flying the rainbow flag, which celebrates the movement for LGBTQ equality.

""Biden believes it was inappropriate to abuse the process that was essential to keep the government open by including this policy targeting LGBTQI+ Americans,"" a White House statement said, adding that the president ""is committed to fighting for LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.""

The White House said that while it had not been able to block the flag proposal, it was ""successful in defeating 50+ other policy riders attacking the LGBTQI+ community that Congressional Republicans attempted to insert into the legislation.""

The law signed by Biden says that no US funding can be used to ""fly or display a flag over a facility of the United States Department of State"" other than US or other government-related flags, or flags supporting prisoners of war, missing-in-action soldiers, hostages and wrongfully imprisoned Americans.

But while such flags may not be flown ""over"" US embassies, it does not speak to displaying them elsewhere on embassy grounds or inside offices, the Biden camp has argued.

""It will have no impact on the ability of members of the LGBTQI+ community to serve openly in our embassies or to celebrate Pride,"" the White House said, referencing the month, usually in June, when LGBTQ parades and other events are held.

The Biden administration has strongly embraced LGBTQ rights. In a sharp change from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not only allowed but encouraged US missions to fly the rainbow flag during Pride month.

Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, ordered that only the US flag fly from embassy flagpoles.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

President Joe Biden signed the bill on Saturday after the Senate passed after midnight, averting a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, welcomed the U.S. funding for the PRGT, noting the trust had a history of bipartisan support.

""Increasing resources for efficient programs like this can lift people out of poverty in developing countries,"" he said.

No comment was immediately available from the IMF.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.",castanet.net,news,Castanet,,-0.0117647058823529,448924628,1,https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/3/2024032313038-65ff0cfb5ba4eedb884f162cjpeg_p3774568.jpg,

EAST HARTFORD, Conn., March 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Pratt & Whitney, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, has received full funding in the recently passed fiscal year 2024 Defense Appropriations bill for its F135 Engine Core Upgrade, which will modernize the F-35's propulsion system to increase durability and fully-enable Block 4 capabilities and beyond starting in 2029.

""This bill will allow Pratt & Whitney to deliver the current and future propulsion capabilities that will keep the United States and its allies on the cutting edge of fighter engine technology,"" said Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines. ""We are incredibly thankful to our congressional allies for their steadfast commitment to supporting these programs.""

$497 million was allocated to the F135 ECU, which will move into detailed design later this year. The ECU is compatible with all three variants of the F-35, will be retrofittable, and will be available to all F-35 operators. The ECU will utilize the same F135 global sustainment network and domestic workforce already in place, supporting more than 57,000 jobs and 225 suppliers that contributed more than $2.2B to the U.S. economy in 2023.

""We are thankful that Congress has embraced and enacted the Defense Department's decision to upgrade the F135 with the Engine Core Upgrade, the lowest-risk, most cost-effective solution to modernizing the F-35,"" said Jeff Shockey, senior vice president, RTX government relations. ""We are fortunate to enjoy continued bipartisan and bicameral support and leadership from our congressional advocates on this critical capability for the warfighter; particularly Sen. Susan Collins, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, and many other members that continue to be staunch advocates of the F135 program.""

The defense bill also includes continued support for the Next-Generation Adaptive Propulsion program, a portion of which will be provided for Pratt & Whitney's XA103 adaptive engine to continue moving toward detailed design review for the prototype engine. Pratt & Whitney remains well-positioned to support concurrent development programs with the capacity and expertise to meet customers' evolving propulsion needs.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

President Joe Biden signed the bill on Saturday after the Senate passed after midnight, averting a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks. The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal. The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters. Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges. Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, welcomed the U.S. funding for the PRGT, noting the trust had a history of bipartisan support.

""Increasing resources for efficient programs like this can lift people out of poverty in developing countries,"" he said. No comment was immediately available from the IMF.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment. ""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

WASHINGTON March 23. 2024 (Saba) - The US Congress passed a law that provides funding for the federal state until September, allowing to avoid partial paralysis that threatened the administration.

After the expiration of the maximum deadline set at midnight on Friday to approve funding for the administration that would allow its bodies to continue their work, the Senate voted in the early morning hours on a funding law worth $1,200 billion after it was approved by the House of Representatives.

After hours of intense negotiations with Republicans, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced from the Senate headquarters, ""It was not easy, but our perseverance tonight paid off.""

He added before final approval of the text, ""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to get the job done.""

The slight delay will not have an impact on the US ministries, which would have been deprived of funding if an agreement had not been reached.",saba.ye,news,سبأنت - وكالة سبأ,,0.06666666666666665,448923832,1,https://www.saba.ye/storage/larage/b0927f56feb117396794758003a21bf6.webp,

Foreign investment continues to withdraw from China amid its slumping economy, despite the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) having put out new incentive measures.

The CCP's Ministry of Commerce released new data on March 22, showing that foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into China from January to February was 215.1 billion yuan ($30 billion), a fall of 19.9 percent year-on-year. The FCI in China has been falling for the eighth consecutive month. The decline was significantly larger than the number released in January, an 11.7 percent fall from the same time last year.

The Ministry of Commerce tried to downplay the sharp fall, saying on Friday that the latest data was dwarfed by the record-high level a year earlier, adding that ""foreign investment is a market behavior and data fluctuations are normal and in line with market rules.""

The CCP has recently put out new plans to attract foreign investment. However, experts pointed out that the communist regime led by the CCP leader Xi Jinping has prioritized political power over economic development and politicized the business environment, causing deep fear among foreign businessmen.

The General Office of the State Council of the Communist Party of China released its ""Action Plan for Greater Efforts to Attract and Utilize Foreign Investment"" on March 19, proposing incentive measures in five areas and emphasizing the need to strengthen the confidence of foreign investment in the development of China.

The plan includes reducing the negatives for foreign investment access, comprehensively lifting restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing industry, and promoting greater opening up in the fields of telecommunications, medical care, and technological innovation. In the fields of banking, insurance, and bonds, access to foreign financial institutions will also be expanded.

""Secondly, China's economy is declining, which needs support from foreign investment, so [CCP premier] Li Qiang emphasized this again [at the CCP's 'Two Sessions' top political meetings earlier this month],"" he said. Recently, China's urban youth unemployment rate and urban unemployment rate have been rising, and ""with more foreign investment, the unemployment problem can be alleviated a little.""

On March 20, the CCP's National Bureau of Statistics released China's urban youth unemployment rate, which was 15.3 percent, excluding school students. It increased by 0.7 percent in February from the previous month.

The new action plan comes as foreign capital continues to flow out of China.

Mr. Wang said: ""the launch of the new action plan shows the Beijing authorities' anxiety about the withdrawal of foreign investment, which can also be seen from the U.S.-China meeting at the end of last year.""

On Oct. 9, 2023, when meeting with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in Beijing, Xi said, ""The economies of China and the United States are deeply integrated, and we can benefit from each other's development.""

However, foreign capital has continued to flee China. In January, China's foreign investment fell 11.7 percent year-on-year to 112.71 billion yuan ($15.78 billion).

Huang Shicong, a Taiwanese economist and political commentator, told The Epoch Times that under the pressure of the confrontation between China and the United States, foreign investment in China has slowed down, and most of the investors have turned their funds to India or ASEAN countries.

""The continuous outflow of foreign capital is very harmful to China's economy and investment, and they [the CCP] have realized this,"" he said.

The U.S. ambassador to China responded to the CCP's goal to attract more foreign investment by saying that China's policies have been sending conflicting signals to foreign investors, especially after it enacted the sweeping anti-espionage law targeting foreign individuals and entities and Chinese who have foreign connections. Safety is a major concern for foreign investors.

""It's not that you just open the market then foreign businessmen will invest. If they will lose their lives and their safety is in question, who will invest?"" Mr. Huang said.

In the European Chamber of Commerce in China's 2023 Business Confidence Survey, a record 64 percent of respondents said that doing business in China was more difficult than the same period last year.

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China recently published a report titled ""Riskful Thinking: Navigating the Politics of Economic Security.""

Mr. Wang said that the main reason for the withdrawal of foreign investment is the CCP. ""The first is the anti-espionage law, and the second is the regime's emphasis on its military-industrial enterprises and state-owned enterprises, all of which endanger foreign-invested companies.""

Mr. Wang pointed out: ""The fundamental issue is that Xi Jinping wants to develop the economy and stabilize his regime, so he has further strengthened the Party's control over foreign capital and foreign companies. Foreign capital must also listen to the Party's words and command.

""If the CCP's policies don't change and the environment doesn't change, no matter how many incentives you give to foreign-funded enterprises or how many markets you open up, it won't be effective,"" he said.",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,0.1372549019607843,448923467,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/10/15/id5510312-GettyImages-1052435648-700x420.jpeg,

Deglobalization is a powerful trend that's taken shape since the pandemic, when disruptions to supply chains and global trade stoked runaway inflation for economies around the world.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

We should have a stop loss in place at 15.93 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 15.89, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

The Senate passed the $95 billion last month, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific, but so far Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, has not brought the bill to the House for a vote.

The speaker argued that he would bring foreign funding under consideration in the House once the long-delayed spending process was completed. Mr. Biden's signature on the latest, $1.2 trillion funding package means the end of the Fiscal Year 2024, and the start of a ticking clock for Mr. Johnson to decide.

""But I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Mr. Biden said in a statement on Saturday.

Part of Mr. Johnson's reasoning for not bringing a vote on the Senate's bill is that it lacked more stringent border security policies. A previous bipartisan Senate package included some conservative border wins but was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans and highly criticized by Mr. Johnson after former President Donald Trump railed against the deal.

Mr. Biden stressed that the speaker must act on that bill, too.

""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It's time to get this done.""

Mr. Johnson has promised to deal with foreign aid and border security when Congress returns in April, but what the House GOP produces could be markedly different from the Senate's offering.

The speaker has a few options to choose from for foreign aid: the Senate's bill, a bipartisan $66 billion House bill with Trump-era border policy, or House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael T. McCaul's yet-to-be-released bill that could include policies to use seized Russian assets or a loan to pay for Ukraine aid.

He also faces pressure in the House from Democrats and Republicans who have signed petitions to force votes on Ukraine aid bills, however, neither of the two petitions have earned enough support yet.

""We have done important work discussing options with members -- such as the REPO Act, loans, additional sanctions, and energy exports, among other measures -- and are preparing to complete our plan for action,"" Mr. Johnson said.

On border security, the speaker has made clear that he wants any proposals to be as close as possible to the House's marquee border bill, the Secure the Border Act, which Democrats have promised to be a non-starter.

""Over the next two weeks, we will be in active discussions among members and leadership to roll out an aggressive plan to highlight the contrasts between the two parties on the catastrophe at the Southern border that is killing countless Americans,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""We will introduce a series of meaningful bills to begin to fix the problem, and we welcome sensible Democrats in the House and Senate to join us.""",washingtontimes.com,news,Washington Times,Alex Miller,0.09019607843137245,448922482,1,https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/03/22/Congress_Budget_33145_c0-340-4694-3076_s1770x1032.jpg?837ddaeee45b2ed985605918ec8724dea7fe9863,eng-9411206

- 'Our persistence has been worth it' -

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

- Speaker under pressure -

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

The race is on for Congress to pass the final spending package for the current budget year and push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. With spending set to expire for several key federal agencies at midnight Friday, the House and Senate are expected to take up a $1.2 trillion measure that combines six annual spending bills into one package.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Biden -- who had the bill delivered to him in Wilmington, Delaware, Saturday -- said in a statement that while the package is a ""compromise,"" it is ""good news for the American people.""

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in the statement, adding that ""it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans"" while investing in child care, cancer research and mental health.

The president also touted how the final package included ""resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include.""

Biden used the statement to urge Congress to pass additional legislation, saying its their ""work isn't finished."" He called on the House to ""pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests"" and urged both chambers to pass the bipartisan border security bill his administration has negotiated, calling it ""the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done,"" Biden added.

The signing of the legislation marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

This legislation is the second part of a two-tiered government funding process. A separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

Biden's signature ends Congress's months-long struggle to secure a long-term spending plan without resorting to stopgaps.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted. But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include,"" Biden said in a statement.

The Senate early Saturday passed the $1.2 trillion spending package, narrowly avoiding a scenario in which several federally funded agencies would have shut down after midnight.

The measure covers about 70 percent of discretionary government spending and completes the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process nearly six months after its scheduled conclusion.

After fending off several amendments, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announced an agreement had been reached and the Senate voted 74-24 to approve the measure, hours after the House passed it earlier in the day by a 286-134 margin.

The 1,000-page legislation contains six separate funding bills that needed to pass by the looming Friday-night deadline in order to avoid a government shutdown.

""We have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government tonight,"" Schumer wrote on the social media platform X. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it. It is good for the American people that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The majority leader praised the effort for containing ""significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more.

""Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk,"" he said.

If the bill had been amended in the Senate, it would would have needed to go back to the House for approval, but with the House adjourned for two weeks, such a measure would have guaranteed a government shutdown.

Earlier Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was hopeful the Senate would pass the funding measure without killer amendments.

""This is about -- this is not about this President,"" she said. ""It's not about the White House. It's about the American people. We've always said that. This is about programs that American families need.""

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

The package will keep the doors open to three-fourths of the government, including the departments of Education, Homeland Security, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and State.

""I'm delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on the floor.

The package would give a boost to funding border protections that had long been supported by Republicans. Democrats were able to score a $1 billion increase in childcare and Head Start funding.

US President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law a long-awaited funding bill passed by Congress, keeping federal agencies running through September and averting a damaging partial government shutdown.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

At the same time, Biden called on lawmakers to approve additional national and border security funding.

""Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests,"" Biden's statement said. ""And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done.""

- 'Our persistence has been worth it' -

A day of high-stakes Capitol Hill drama began at midday Friday, when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to Biden's desk.

Budget negotiations looked close to breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived, and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said while the bill was ""far from perfect, I voted for this appropriations bill because it provides critical funding for our military and for border security.""

- Speaker under pressure -

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same maneuver led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as funding for the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

During their meeting in Cairo, President Sisi and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed explored avenues to enhance the distinguished bilateral cooperation between Egypt and the UAE, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement.

The two presidents emphasized promising opportunities to deepen both countries' partnership.

Additionally, the two presidents discussed the intensified efforts being made to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and ensure the sufficient delivery of humanitarian aid to alleviate the significant suffering in the strip.

Both leaders affirmed the necessity of activating the two-state solution as the sole means of attaining justice, security, and stability in the broader region.

These discussions follow the signing of a monumental $35 billion investment agreement between Egypt and the UAE just a month ago. The deal entails Emirati investors developing the Ras El-Hekma area on the North Coast of Egypt.

This investment represents the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country's history and comes after Egypt endured a scarcity of foreign currency for approximately two years.

Simultaneously, the talks between the Egyptian and Emirati presidents take place amidst ongoing negotiations to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bring an end to over five months of Israeli attacks in the area.

However, a recent attempt to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza through a US-sponsored UN resolution, which called for a cessation of hostilities and a prisoner exchange, faced a veto by Russia and China on Friday.

A ceasefire is urgently needed to augment aid delivery and facilitate a prisoner swap agreement.

The urgency for aid in Gaza has escalated, with the United Nations estimating that at least a quarter of the strip's population is on the verge of famine.

During a ministerial meeting in Cairo on Thursday, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar collectively called for the opening of all border crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip to enable the unobstructed delivery of humanitarian assistance.",egypttoday.com,news,EgyptToday,,0.3176470588235294,448921478,1,https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202403230959325932.jpg,

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Del., where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for some agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The package that Biden signed Saturday covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

Combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued is crucial to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the Defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down by House Republican resistance.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans for the latest spending package, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pointed to some of the funding increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1-billion increase for Head Start programs and new child-care centers for military families. They also played up a $120-million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100-million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286 to 134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for fast-track approval.

The vote in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of intransigence on the party's right flank, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) initiated an effort to oust Johnson from the speakership as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the lawmakers return in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

""Our school is located in an area where winter sports are popular, and we believe that cross country skiing is a great way for our students and their families to stay active and healthy during the winter months,"" said Tatla Lake Elementary and Jr. Secondary School principal Kimberley Ikebuchi in her grant application for the funds.

The school received $9,000 and used it to purchase skis and boots, replacing some aging equipment.

Ikebuchi said Caribou Ski Source for Sports outfitted the school the first week in March.

""We are heading up to our Tatla Lake ski grounds tomorrow to try out the new gear,"" she said Tuesday, March 12.

She said members of the Tatla Lake Ski Club, who supported the grant, were attending to help lend a hand.

""We are really excited to have new gear for our students and hope to expand our cross-country ski activities at the school in future years.""

While health and wellness aspects of the cross-country ski program will be a given, Ikebuchi in her application touted the environmental stewardship aspects.

Because cross-country skiing is an outdoor activity, the students are close to mountains, forests and parks.

""As such, learning to ski can help individuals develop a deeper appreciation and respect for nature,"" she noted. ""Learning to ski provides opportunities to teach students about the importance of sustainable practices, such as leaving no trace, properly disposing of waste, and respecting wildlifre habitats.""

There are presently 23 students enrolled in the school.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Positioned as a premier investment for 2024, BlockDAG's ongoing presale promises unparalleled returns, drawing attention from across the crypto spectrum.

With its massive success in the previous batches, investors are rushing to buy BDAG at Batch 4 for $0.0025. The massive frenzy points to a rapid sell-off of the batch within a day.

Despite its ambitious Napoli hard fork aimed at reducing transaction fees, Polygon's MATIC faces a 22% setback from its yearly high. The current market analysis suggests a bearish path, with key support levels identified. However, a rebound is not off the table if MATIC rises above the crucial $0.9907 mark, potentially reversing the negative momentum.

Monero, even after being delisted from Binance and experiencing a notable price dip, has rebounded impressively. Currently, XMR showcases a 13.29% increase over the last month, at around $138.28. This comeback is supported by positive technical indicators and a high Fear & Greed Index score, painting a bright future for XMR investors.

BlockDAG has swiftly captured the market's interest with its innovative approach and potential for significant gains. Following a high-profile introduction in Tokyo, the project has quickly amassed over $7.4 million in its presale phase. The current stage sees a 50% price hike, indicating the presale's high demand and the imminent closure of this phase.

BlockDAG's distinctive offering includes its X-series mining rigs, which provide an eco-friendly and efficient solution for crypto mining. These rigs cater to various mining needs, promising daily earnings and supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. The potential for daily passive income, coupled with BlockDAG's ambitious plans, places it at the forefront of crypto investments.

In addition to its impressive presale performance, BlockDAG has announced a $2 million mega giveaway, further engaging its community and inviting new participants. This initiative, along with the projected ROI, underscores BlockDAG's commitment to its investors and its vision for the future of cryptocurrency.

Monero and MATIC navigate their respective paths as the cryptocurrency market evolves amidst the industry's ups and downs. Meanwhile, BlockDAG's presale achievements and innovative mining solutions set a new standard for crypto investments. Offering a significant ROI and backed by a strong technological foundation, BlockDAG is positioned as a top choice for investors looking towards 2024, symbolizing a shift in the digital finance landscape.",tekedia.com,news,Tekedia,Ti Partners,0.2078431372549019,448920747,1,https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20144344/blockdag2.jpg,eng-9414190

Delhi-based career guidance platform for students and educators, Mindler on Tuesday announced that it is raising a $1 million pre-Series A round led by Inflection Point Ventures.

According to the startup, the newly raised funds will be utilised towards expanding Mindler's base of institutional partnerships and alliances.

As part of its growth chart for 2021, Mindler now plans to further strengthen its platform with the objective of shaping the entire career guidance ecosystem.

""We are focusing on both the demand and supply side of the career guidance landscape and thus, creating a sustainable model for long-term client engagement and retention. We are driving a movement to enable students to take a scientific approach towards career decision-making,"" added Prateek.

""Our school is located in an area where winter sports are popular, and we believe that cross country skiing is a great way for our students and their families to stay active and healthy during the winter months,"" said Tatla Lake Elementary and Jr. Secondary School principal Kimberley Ikebuchi in her grant application for the funds.

The school received $9,000 and used it to purchase skis and boots, replacing some aging equipment.

Ikebuchi said Caribou Ski Source for Sports outfitted the school the first week in March.

""We are heading up to our Tatla Lake ski grounds tomorrow to try out the new gear,"" she said Tuesday, March 12.

She said members of the Tatla Lake Ski Club, who supported the grant, were attending to help lend a hand.

""We are really excited to have new gear for our students and hope to expand our cross-country ski activities at the school in future years.""

While health and wellness aspects of the cross-country ski program will be a given, Ikebuchi in her application touted the environmental stewardship aspects.

Because cross-country skiing is an outdoor activity, the students are close to mountains, forests and parks.

""As such, learning to ski can help individuals develop a deeper appreciation and respect for nature,"" she noted. ""Learning to ski provides opportunities to teach students about the importance of sustainable practices, such as leaving no trace, properly disposing of waste, and respecting wildlifre habitats.""

The Punjab government approved the project four years ago, with an estimated cost of Rs240 million. The project has been delayed for four years due to the non-availability of funds. After renovation, the historic gurdwaras and temples, including Haveli Sujan Singh, will be opened to tourists.

Talking to The Express Tribune, a senior district administration official stated while requesting anonymity that former commissioner Captain (retd) Muhammad Mehmood had obtained approval for the project from the Punjab government in 2020.

Due to improper maintenance, the 132-year-old Haveli Sujan Singh -- a significant cultural heritage site -- has crumbled into ruin.

The former Rawalpindi commissioner had taken approval from the Punjab government to renovate Haveli Sujan Singh to preserve this heritage and introduce its history to tourists. The project included the renovation of the Haveli, including the historic seven gurdwaras and a temple around the Haveli.

According to the officer, the project's goal was to transform the historic streets of the inner Bhabra Bazaar into walking streets, in which the balconies of all the ancient buildings were to be painted with colourful patterns.

The plan included establishing a library on the ground floor of Haveli Sujan Singh, which would store historical books. On the top floor, however, a restaurant will be constructed where visitors may sit and have tea while learning about the Haveli's history.

The plan involved relocating electricity poles, telephones and other wires installed in the streets near Haveli Sajjan Singh to restore some of the old scenery. Although it was also part of the plan to establish a museum on the second level of Haveli. This museum was to house artefacts pertaining to the Sikh and British Raj.

Sources said despite the project's approval, the Rawalpindi administration will not pay the amount required to start the project. The lack of funding causes the project to be postponed continuously.

A Sikh family-owned Haveli Sujan Singh, they left this Haveli at the time of the partition and migrated to India. This family also owned the Badshahi Mahal on Mall Road, which currently houses the Fatima Jinnah Women's University.

Before this project, the plan to make Haveli Sajan Singh a campus of Fatima Jinnah University was also under consideration, however, it could not be implemented due to various reasons.

Haveli Sujan Singh consists of 45 large rooms, which is associated with witnessing British architectural style. Its balconies have wooden arches and doors that relate to the view. The purpose of opening this mansion for tourists was not only to preserve the cultural heritage and introduce it to the next generations but also to promote the Potohar culture, which has been delayed due to a lack of funds.

Regarding the delay of the Haveli Sujan Singh revamp project, the district administration stated that the newly elected Chief Minister, Maryam Nawaz, is giving great importance to the historical buildings.

The Rawalpindi district administration will try to implement the project of the present Punjab chief minister to secure the cultural buildings; a lot of work has already been done on this project.

""Buildings associated with cultural heritage are our hallmark, and we will also ensure their safety. The homework for this project has been completed; the only thing lacking is funding, which will be addressed with every effort,"" the official said.",tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,,0.06666666666666665,448920191,1,https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/21638561540-01701415609-0/21638561540-01701415609-0.jpg,

There is no current Support Plan to trigger a buy of this stock at this time. This usually means that there are no clear support levels at this time, so buying the stock as it falls could be considered catching a falling knife. Buy signals only exist if resistance breaks higher.

This often is a signal that the stock you are watching is weak. Waiting for a turn higher may be more intelligent than trying to catch a falling knife. In any case, new support levels are usually revised to the database at the beginning of the next trading session.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ISSC as it gets near 7.62, but the downside target is not available from the current data. This tells us to hold that position if it is triggered until a new downside target has been established (updates occur at the beginning of every trading session) or until the position has been stopped. The summary data tells us to have a stop loss in place at 7.64. 7.62 is the first level of resistance above 7.42, and by rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance 7.62 is being tested, so a short signal would exist.

If 7.62 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy ISSC just slightly over 7.62, with an upside target of 8.23. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 7.6 in case the stock turns against the trade. 7.62 is the first level of resistance above 7.42, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 7.62, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ISSC if it tests 7.62 with a downside target of 7.28. We should have a stop loss in place at 7.64 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 7.62, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data tells us to buy ISWN near 19.34, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 19.28 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 19.34 is the first level of support below 19.5699, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 19.34 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy ISWN just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 19.5699, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ISWN if it tests n/a with a downside target of 19.49. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 19.62 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy ISWN just slightly over 19.62, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 19.57 in case the stock turns against the trade. 19.62 is the first level of resistance above 19.5699, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 19.62, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ISWN if it tests 19.62 with a downside target of 18.49. We should have a stop loss in place at 19.67 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal.

President Biden waves to members of the media as he walks toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Friday to travel to Wilmington, Del. Andrew Harnik/Associated Press

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement - the toughest and fairest reforms in decades - to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and docketed under 24-cv-00465, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired: (a) Instacart common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Offering Documents (defined below) issued in connection with the Company's initial public offering conducted on or about September 19, 2023 (the ""IPO"" or ""Offering""); and/or (b) Instacart securities between September 19, 2023 and October 1, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

Instacart provides online grocery shopping services to households in North America. The Company sells and delivers a range of products in the food, alcohol, consumer health, pet care, and ready-made meals categories, in addition to others. The Company offers its services through a mobile application and website, while also providing software-as-a-service solutions to retailers.

On August 25, 2023, Instacart filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on September 18, 2023 (the ""Registration Statement"").

On September 19, 2023, pursuant to the Registration Statement, Instacart's common stock began publicly trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (""NASDAQ"") under the ticker symbol ""CART"".

On September 20, 2023, Instacart filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (the ""Prospectus"" and, collectively with the Registration Statement, the ""Offering Documents"").

Pursuant to the Offering Documents, Instacart and other selling stockholders identified in the Prospectus sold 14.1 million and 7.9 million shares of the Company's common stock to the public, respectively, at the Offering price of $30.00 per share for total proceeds of approximately $400 million and $224 million to Instacart and the selling stockholders, respectively, after applicable underwriting discounts and commissions.

The complaint alleges that the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. In addition, the complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Offering Documents and Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Instacart had overstated the extent to which online grocery shopping and delivery habits among consumers were accelerating; (ii) Instacart had downplayed the extent of the competition that it faced in the online grocery shopping and delivery market; (iii) accordingly, Defendants overstated the Company's post-IPO growth, business, and financial prospects; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2023, Reuters published an article noting, among other things, that Instacart's stock price was falling after ""lukewarm analyst reports"" indicated that the Company would struggle from heavy competition. For example, the article noted that ""BTIG analyst Jake Fuller gave Instacart a 'neutral' rating and warned that the company faces heavy competition from DoorDash (DASH.N) and Uber Technologies (UBER.N) in the slowly expanding market of grocery delivery.""

On this news, Instacart's stock price fell $0.65 per share, or 2.12%, to close at $30.00 per share on September 22, 2023.

Then, on October 2, 2023, investment research firm Gordon Haskett initiated coverage of Instacart with a ""hold"" rating, stating that it ""ha[s] doubts that online grocery delivery adoption will continue to materially increase at a time when consumers are becoming increasingly cautious about spending"", while similarly citing the competitive environment in the online grocery shopping and delivery market as a headwind to the Company's business.

On this news, Instacart's stock price fell $2.73 per share, or 9.2%, to close at $26.96 per share on October 2, 2023.

As of the time the complaint was filed, Instacart's common stock continues to trade below the $30.00 per share Offering price, damaging investors.

Amylyx is a commercial-stage biotechnology company that engages in the discovery and development of treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (""ALS""), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The Company's products include, among others, AMX0035 (commercially referred to as ""RELYVRIO"" in the U.S.), a dual UPR-Bax apoptosis inhibitor composed of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, for the treatment of ALS in adults in the U.S.

Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's September 2022 approval of RELYVRIO for the treatment of ALS in adults in the U.S., Defendants consistently touted the drug's commercial prospects and prescription rate.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had overstated RELYVRIO's commercial prospects; (ii) patients were discontinuing treatment with RELYVRIO after six months; (iii) the rate at which new patients were starting treatment with RELYVRIO was decreasing; (iv) accordingly, Defendants had also overstated RELYVRIO's prescription rate; (v) Defendants attempted to hide the foregoing negative trends from investors and the market by blocking analysts from viewing RELYVRIO's prescription data; and (vi) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On November 9, 2023, Amylyx issued a press release announcing its third quarter (""Q3"") 2023 financial results, including Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, missing consensus estimates by $0.12. That same day, on a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss these results, Company management revealed that, despite ""a [purported] steady cadence of new prescriptions written in"" Q3 for RELYVRIO, Amylyx's ""results were impacted by a number of factors"" including a ""slowdown in net adds"" for RELYVRIO in Q3, which ""was primarily driven by increased discontinuations for a variety of reasons"", with only ""60% of people taking RELYVRIO remain[ing] on therapy six months after initiation in the U.S.""

Also on November 9, 2023, Investor's Business Daily published an article addressing the Company's disappointing financial results (the "" IBD Article""). The IBD Article cited an Evercore ISI analyst, who questioned Amylyx's assertion that the number of new patients starting treatment with RELYVRIO was ""steady"", noting that his math suggested otherwise and that Amylyx had blocked analysts from viewing RELYVRIO's prescription data in the summer of 2023. The analyst also stated that, ""[k]nowing that [Amylyx's] stock had underperformed in 2023 already, management could have communicated the discontinuations dynamic much earlier,"" and that the ""[s]tock move today in a bad biotech tape and fund performance doesn't help investor confidence among folks that have held onto the stock.""

Following these disclosures and the publication of the IBD Article, Amylyx's stock price fell $5.74 per share, or 31.89%, to close at $12.26 per share on November 9, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

B. Riley is a financial services platform. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides services including investment banking, brokerage, wealth management, asset management, direct lending, business advisory, valuation, and asset disposition. B. Riley's clients include public and private companies, financial sponsors, investors, financial institutions, and individuals.

Brian Kahn (""Kahn"") is a client of B. Riley. Kahn is the Chief Executive Officer of Franchise Group, Inc. f/k/a Liberty Tax (""FRG""), which B. Riley has had dealings with since at least 2018. B. Riley has provided significant funds to FRG and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, and/or other entities controlled by Kahn, since at least December 2021. FRG is a holding company which acquires and manages companies, primarily franchises. FRG's businesses include Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and Buddy's Newco LLC (d/b/a Buddy's Home Furnishings) (""Buddy's""), among others.

In May 2023, B. Riley entered into an agreement to assist Kahn in leading a management buyout of FRG. The $2.8 billion deal to take FRG private was completed on August 21, 2023. The transaction was partially financed by Nomura Holdings Inc. (""Nomura"") via B. Riley, who secured the financing allowing Kahn and other senior management of FRG to acquire the remaining 64% stake that they did not already own.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (i) Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Kahn and/or one or more of his controlled entities were engaged in illicit business activities; (ii) Kahn had been credibly implicated in a conspiracy to defraud investors of millions of dollars; (iii) in spite of all the foregoing, B. Riley continued to finance the transaction enabling Kahn and others to take FRG private through complex arrangements; (iv) the foregoing was reasonably likely to draw regulatory scrutiny to B. Riley; and (v) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On November 2, 2023, Kahn was implicated as the unnamed co-conspirator in a conspiracy to defraud investors of $294 million in funds. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") announced that Prophecy Asset Management (""Prophecy"") president John Hughes (""Hughes"") had pled guilty to the charge with two unnamed co-defendants. The same day, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Hughes in connection with these allegations, styled Securities and Exchange Commission v. John Hughes, No. 3:23-cv-21816 (D.N.J. filed November 2, 2023) (the ""SEC Complaint""). The SEC Complaint, inter alia, implicated, among others, both Kahn and Buddy's in the alleged conspiracy to defraud investors. Bloomberg reported on that same day that Kahn had been identified by ""a person familiar with the matter"" as one of two co-conspirators.

On November 3, 2023, after the market closed, The Friendly Bear posted on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), doubting whether B. Riley knew of Kahn's involvement and disclosed the same to Nomura. The Friendly Bear also commented that the DOJ's ""charging document clearly implicates him [ i.e., Kahn] in Hughes' crime. There is a high chance of indictment here.""

On this news, B. Riley's stock price fell $9.02, or 22%, to close at $32.54 per share on the next trading day, November 6, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and the price of B. Riley's 6.00% Senior Notes due 2028 (""6% Senior Notes"") fell $1.77, or 9.01%, to close at $17.87 per 6% Senior Note on the next trading day, November 6, 2023.

Then, on November 9, 2023, after the market closed, the Company revealed significant details concerning the FRG transaction and the years-long series of complex financial transactions between B. Riley, Kahn, and the Company's respective subsidiaries, which culminated in the August 21, 2023 transaction. Analyzing these complex transactions, The Friendly Bear reported that ""B Riley ended up funding 281MM of what was around a 560MM equity check. That's over 50% ownership. Yet they claim to have only 31% voting rights. It looks like B Riley engaged in some funny business to avoid consolidation and placed control of FRG in the hands of the star of 'Prophecy' - Brian Kahn.""

On this news, B. Riley's stock price fell $4.47, or 15%, to close at $25.60 per share on November 10, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and B. Riley's 6% Senior Note price fell $1.01, or 5.34%, to close at $17.92 per 6% Senior Note on November 10, 2023. B. Riley's stock price continued to fall $3.59, or 14%, over the next consecutive trading session to close at $22.01 per share on November 13, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and B. Riley's 6% Senior Note price fell $3.06, or 17.08%, over the next consecutive trading session to close at $14.86 per 6% Senior Note on November 13, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Hut 8 is a crypto currency and data mining company. The Company is engaged in Bitcoin mining and hosting, managed services, energy arbitrage, and operating traditional data centers. The Company operates computing infrastructure which mines Bitcoin and delivers computing services to enterprise customers.

Hut 8 formed following the November 2023 merger of Hut 8 Mining Corp. and U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. d/b/a US Bitcoin Corp. (""USBTC"") (the ""Merger""). USBTC held a 50% interest in a joint venture bitcoin mining facility, located in King Mountain, Texas (the ""King Mountain JV""), which was acquired in the Merger.

Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that one of USBTC's largest shareholders is an undisclosed related party; (2) that USBTC's core asset has historically failed to provide energy and high-speed internet; (3) that the profitability of certain USBTC assets were overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On January 18, 2024, at approximately 10:30 AM EST, J Capital Research published a report which alleged, inter alia, that Hut 8's merger with USBTC was premised on a number of alleged misstatements, including (1) that the USBTC had an ""undisclosed related party"" as one of its largest shareholders, (2) that one of USBTC's core assets, the King Mountain JV, ""has historically failed to provide energy and high-speed internet,"" and (3) that the Company had misstated certain finances of the King Mountain JV by failing to account for certain interest expenses. Citing individuals ""highly familiar"" with USBTC, the report stated that, without the Merger, USBTC would have undergone bankruptcy and that USBTC had a value estimated to be 70% less than the approximately $745 million that Hut 8 paid to acquire it.

On this news, Hut 8's stock price fell $2.16, or 23.3%, to close at $7.12 per share on January 18, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(""Cassava"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: SAVA). The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and docketed under 24 -cv- 00977, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Cassava securities between August 18, 2022 and October 12, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

Cassava is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company's lead therapeutic drug candidate is PTI-125 (or ""simufilam""), a small molecule drug for the proposed treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In March 2020, Cassava initiated a long-term, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of simufilam 100 mg twice daily for 12 or more months in patients with Alzheimer's disease and to assess exploratory efficacy endpoints, such as changes in cognition, and biomarkers.

Then, in August 2021, a Citizen Petition requested the United States Food & Drug Administration (""FDA"") to halt any phase 3 trials of simufilam due to concerns regarding data manipulation. Specifically, the Citizen Petition referenced ""grave concerns about the quality and integrity of the laboratory-based studies surrounding this drug candidate and supporting the claims for its efficacy.""

However, in response, Cassava denied the allegations in the Citizen Petition and instead touted the effectiveness of simufilam and the efficacy of the Company's research programs. Indeed, in a press release published shortly after the FDA received the Citizen Petition, Cassava stated that ""[t]he Company stands behind its science, its scientists and its scientific collaborators."" Thereafter, Cassava continued to maintain its defense of simufilam even as criticisms of simufilam were revealed from additional sources and academic journals such as Neurobiology of Aging and the Journal of Neuroscience issued ""expressions of concern"" regarding the efficacy of the drug.

On October 12, 2023, the peer-reviewed academic journal Science reported that Professor Hoau-Yan Wang (""Dr. Wang""), a City University of New York researcher associated with the research program for simufilam, had been investigated by university officials for possible data manipulation. Although the investigative committee did not have access to the raw data at issue and thus was unable to confirm that data manipulation had occurred, members made their conclusion based on ""long-standing and egregious misconduct in data management and record keeping by Dr. Wang"" and ""found evidence highly suggestive of deliberate scientific misconduct"" by Dr. Wang.

On this news, Cassava's stock price fell $2.68 per share, or 15.28%, to close at $14.86 per share on October 13, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company failed to maintain adequate and effective data management controls and procedures related to its drug research programs; (ii) as a result, the data published in support of simufilam were susceptible to manipulation to overstate the drug's effectiveness; (iii) accordingly, Cassava had misrepresented the efficacy of its research programs and the clinical and/or commercial prospects of simufilam; (iv) all of the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to subject the Company to significant financial and/or reputational harm; and (v) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

Ventyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops small-molecule product candidates to address a range of inflammatory diseases. The Company's lead clinical product candidate is VTX958, a selective allosteric tyrosine kinase type 2 inhibitor for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. In 2022, Ventyx initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of VTX958 for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (the ""Phase 2 SERENITY Trial"").

On September 29, 2021, Ventyx filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") in connection with the IPO, which, after several amendments, was declared effective by the SEC on October 20, 2021 (the ""Registration Statement"").

On October 21, 2021, Ventyx filed a prospectus on Form 424B4 with the SEC in connection with the IPO, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement (the ""Prospectus"" and, collectively with the Registration Statement, the ""Offering Documents"").

The complaint alleges that the Offering Documents were negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading and were not prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations governing their preparation. In addition, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Offering Documents and Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) VTX958 was less effective in treating psoriasis than Defendants had led investors to believe; (ii) as a result, VTX958's clinical and/or commercial prospects were overstated; (iii) accordingly, the Company had misrepresented its ability to develop and commercialize effective product candidates; (iv) Ventyx's post-IPO business prospects were thus inflated; and (v) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On November 6, 2023, during after-market hours, Ventyx issued a press release announcing results from the Phase 2 SERENITY Trial. Therein, the Company disclosed that ""[a]lthough the trial achieved its primary endpoint, the magnitude of efficacy observed did not meet our internal target to support the advancement of VTX958 in plaque psoriasis."" Based on these results, the Company announced that it ""will terminate ongoing activities in the Phase 2 plaque psoriasis trial effective immediately"" and ""terminate the ongoing Phase 2 trial of VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis.""

On this news, Ventyx's common stock price fell $11.36 per share, or 80.62%, to close at $2.73 per share on November 7, 2023.

Then, on November 22, 2023, Ventyx disclosed in a filing with the SEC on Form 8-K that the Company's President and Chief Medical Officer Defendant William J. Sandborn would cease to serve in those roles.

As of the time this Complaint was filed, the price of Ventyx common stock continues to trade below the $16.00 per share Offering price, damaging investors.

Among these, the Ethereum presale of 2014 stands out as a landmark event. A select group of investors gained early access to Ether tokens at a discounted rate of $0.31 per ETH. Imagine how lucky these savvy investors were to snatch up this undervalued crypto gem and turn their modest investments into fortunes.

The crypto market is notorious for high volatility, but presale projects stand out as a beacon of predictability, as their price is pinned to a certain level until they get listed on a DEX. So, they are immune to market fluctuations.

The second reason is the low price. As in the Ethereum example above, its presale price was exponentially lower than its post-listing price. Similarly, most emerging projects aim to raise some capital, so they try to attract investors with highly favorable offers.

A myriad of emerging projects are vying for investors' attention. The competition is fierce, but certain contenders with a strong concept and high utility clearly stand out. Unlike many junk tokens, such as meme coins, whose value is based solely on the hype around them, the projects with real practical use have a more solid foundation.

BlastUP is the first launchpad on the Blast blockchain, a unique Layer 2 solution offering a native yield of 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. This groundbreaking approach has made Blast quite popular, and it has already attracted a huge army of fans, hitting a $1 billion in TLV in just one month. Moreover, the recent launch of the Blast Mainnet has pushed it to the top 10 projects in terms of TLV. Being a part of such a robust ecosystem, BlastUP is already ticking the boxes for its reliability.

The presale of BlastUP tokens ($BLP) is currently running, and buying them now could be compared with investing in ETH during its presale. The current BLP value is pinned at merely 5 US cents, while its listing price is set at $0.1, which already makes a 50% ROI.

Those who buy BlastUP tokens at the presale stage get access to exclusive early benefits including participation in an Airdrop to get free $BLP tokens. The utility of BlastUP tokens spreads far and wide, offering its users access to:

Moreover, $BLP holders get Booster Points, special tokens that BlastUP is launching to support the community. Booster Point is a fuel for the Community Incentives Program (CIP) intended for the creation of a solid base for launching projects and making them successful.

In just one month, BlastUP has attracted over $2.5 million in investments, which speaks much for its wide recognition. The presale runs until the end of May, so it's not too late to buy a possible crypto gem at the best price.

Don't miss out! Secure your BlastUP tokens today at the most competitive price!

As a committed participant within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP plays an integral role in fostering mutual growth and progress. Recently, it has established strategic alliances with other esteemed members of the Blast family, marking a significant milestone - the highly anticipated launch of the Blast Mainnet.

The partnerships with Blast Alpha, Blastopedia, and Blast Ecosystem not only emphasize BlastUP's dedication to community development but also showcase its commitment to delivering captivating experiences for its users through entertaining contests. These recent collaborations have the potential to enhance the visibility and reputation of BlastUP.

BlastUP is more than a sound investment opportunity; it is a catalyst for creating a rewarding environment for DApp launches. Embracing a motto ""Grow faster, earn more,"" BlastUP is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the success of blockchain startups. Central to its strategy is the Launchpad Accelerator crafted to provide startup teams with comprehensive documentation and refined tokenomics, thereby smoothing the path for effective capital raising.

At the core of BlastUP's ethos is an uncompromising focus on security. Through its rigorous Project Screening, the platform ensures admission is reserved exclusively for the most trustworthy projects, thus safeguarding the integrity of its entire ecosystem. This commitment to security cements BlastUP's reputation as the premier destination for those seeking dependability.

Moving forward, BlastUP is set to revolutionize startup launches on the Blast network by leveraging AI and Web3 technologies. Its 2026 strategic roadmap reveals ambitious plans, such as an AI-enhanced IDO screener, dedicated tools for AI-enabled startup teams, and the launch of an interactive Community Marketplace. This firm commitment highlights BlastUP's focus on advancing its ecosystem's potential and leading the way in blockchain innovation.

The volatile yet lucrative landscape of cryptocurrency investments presents notable opportunities akin to the storied Ethereum presale of 2014. In this context, BlastUP stands out as an investment of note, offering potential gains through its ongoing $BLP token presale.

BlastUP is not just another crypto project, it stands as a harbinger of progressive blockchain utility and investment value.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Nifty briefly dipped below its 50-day moving average, while Bank Nifty breached the 100-day moving average. However, robust recovery in recent trading sessions has pushed both indices back above the 50-day moving average, indicating a positive near-term outlook. As long as both indices defend this level, the trend is likely to remain bullish. Call-put concentration suggests 22,000 remains a key resistance area, with significant put writing between 21,900-22,000. Sustaining above 22,000 could trigger short-covering, potentially driving Nifty towards 22,250-22,300. Currently, our stance is bullish, recommending a buy-on-dips strategy with 21,900 as a stop-loss for Nifty and 46,500 for Bank Nifty. We anticipate further recovery towards 47,200 for Bank Nifty leading up to the March series expiry.

Rajesh Palviya: The Nifty IT sector has faced downward pressure for the past few days. Currently hovering near its 100-day moving average at around 35,100, a breach of this level could lead to further declines towards 34,700-34,600. However, stalwarts like TCS and HCL Tech exhibit resilience on longer-term charts, suggesting potential buying opportunities amid corrections. We remain watchful of Nifty IT's ability to hold the 100-day moving average; sustaining above it could signal further buying interest. For traders, monitoring levels around 35,100 is crucial. Preferred picks include TCS and HCL Tech, provided they hold crucial support levels.

Rajesh Palviya: Nifty Auto continues its bullish trajectory, with stocks like Maruti, Bajaj Auto, and Mahindra & Mahindra trading near all-time highs. Maruti presents an opportunity for another rally towards 12,600-12,800, with a stop-loss at 12,100. Similarly, Bajaj Auto shows promise with a near-term target of 9,300 and a stop-loss at 8,750. Mahindra & Mahindra, despite recent corrections, remains strong on longer-term charts, with an upside potential towards 1950-2000 and a stop-loss at 1830.

Rajesh Palviya: PSU stocks have witnessed a robust recovery, indicating further upside potential. Key stocks like Canara Bank and BHEL exhibit strong buying interest, with targets towards 590-600 and 2% stop-losses. Overall, as long as Nifty holds above 22,000, we anticipate continued recovery in the PSU basket. Investors can consider adding these stocks to their portfolio, with CPSE ETF also presenting an attractive option with a target around 85 and a stop-loss at 76.

Rajesh Palviya: As we approach the March series expiry, several stocks are trading near all-time highs. Pidilite stands out with a target of 3015 and a stop-loss at 2920. JSW Energy exhibits recovery potential towards 545, with a stop-loss at 506. Additionally, Indus Towers shows promise with a near-term target of 295 and a stop-loss at 266.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

This much-loved cinema started in 1979 in an old church and grew into a place as special as the British Film Theatre in London. It had to shut down on October 6, 2022, when the company that looked after it went bust.

But lots of people, including famous actors like Ewen Bremner and Brian Cox, wanted to save it. A new plan was made to bring the Filmhouse back, with a team that includes folks who've been part of it for over 20 years.

They also tried to get some money through Crowdfunder, aiming for £300,000, and they're nearly there with £254,430 already raised. On March 19, they found out they were getting the cash they asked for from the Levelling Up Fund. Now they're getting ready to take over the building on May 1 and start making it even better.

They want to fix it up nicely, add a new screen just for learning stuff, and make the seats fewer but comfier. They also want to make it easier for everyone to move around inside. James Rice, who used to sell tickets there from 2003 until 2019, said this money was really needed because without it, things looked pretty unsure.

Mr Rice shared: ""If we hadn't got the grant, I don't know what the outcome would have been. The refit matters because it helps us to attract new people in. We want to try to introduce people to a broader range of cinema.

""The core message is to deliver a full programme, including documentaries and 2001: A Space Odyssey. A large proportion of what we do is not screened at other cinemas.

""We have got to this point because of the strength of feeling and support, from letter writing and public meetings. There's some people who worked here who went onto be film-makers.""

Mr Rice explained that even though streaming services and gadgets like firesticks are popular, Edinburgh's cinemas saw a 33% increase in visitors last year compared to 2022. The Filmhouse boasts about having ""the most ambitious cultural film programme outside the British Film Theatre"" in London and has been the home of the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years.

They're thinking about different ticket prices, like ""pay what you can"", to make sure everyone can afford to come. Trustee Ginnie Atkinson shared that they've collected another £800,000 from kind donors, but the money from the UK Government is really making a big difference.

She mentioned that they're planning to update things, especially since people said the old seats were too small and worn out. Ms Atkinson expressed her delight, stating: ""This is absolutely transformational. When we applied the amount was aspirational. We have to attract new audiences and make it a modern, comfortable cinema experience.""

Hoping for an early reopening, she mentioned: ""Our aspiration is to open on October 6, the two-year anniversary of it closing. We are hoping before Christmas.""

However, she also noted that the actual opening date might be between six months to a year. Donald Cameron, from the Scotland Office, was shown around and duly praised the extra funds. He commented on how certain ""communities"", including artists, international students and those outside Edinburgh, would benefit.

Explaining the broader implications, Mr Cameron stated: ""It's really important that a facility like this is accessible to everyone. People travel from the Borders to visit. We hope it attracts people from across Scotland.""

A reassurance followed with him saying, ""We hope the Filmhouse will be able to open again. It is for the local community. I think it's right that the UK Government is funding it.""

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Biden -- who had the bill delivered to him in Wilmington, Delaware, Saturday -- said in a statement that while the package is a ""compromise,"" it is ""good news for the American people.""

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in the statement, adding that ""it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans"" while investing in child care, cancer research and mental health.

The president also touted how the final package included ""resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include.""

Biden used the statement to urge Congress to pass additional legislation, saying its their ""work isn't finished."" He called on the House to ""pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests"" and urged both chambers to pass the bipartisan border security bill his administration has negotiated, calling it ""the toughest and fairest reforms in decades.""

""It's time to get this done,"" Biden added.

The signing of the legislation marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

This legislation is the second part of a two-tiered government funding process. A separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

These guidelines include the regular update of the vehicles' systems in the case of need, or when the manufacturer requires it through its official representative, or when it is communicated to the consumer via the regular communication means, and in all cases each time the vehicle undergoes maintenance or repairs. It allows to fulfill the dual objective of maintaining the vehicle and ensuring road safety. This system update is extremely important and applies to all categories of vehicles, including hybrid and electric ones. It guarantees consumers' safety, and allows them to maintain their vehicle's performance at its original level. Furthermore, the update ensures the adoption of the latest improvements implemented by the manufacturer on their vehicle systems. This system update finally contributes to protecting the consumers' investment by maintaining the condition and value of their vehicle. In co nclusion, the association notes that the manufacturer's warranty includes performing these updates on a regular basis. In this regard, AIA emphasizes the need to carry out update procedures at maintenance centers affiliated with authorized dealerships exclusively. Only the latter are in capacity of representing global manufacturers, and conducting recall campaigns requested by manufacturers, and ensuring that consumers receive qualified maintenance and continuous monitoring of systems according to the latest manufacturer's standards. AIA brings together authorized representatives of all global automotive manufacturers in Lebanon. The association aims to raise awareness among Lebanese consumers about their rights, especially the request of a manufacturer's warranty at the time of purchase.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement - the toughest and fairest reforms in decades - to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress passed the long-overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats boasted of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same strategy that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

BioVie is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that purports to engage in the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drugs therapies, including for treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease.

Prior to the Class Period, in its 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on May 10, 2021, BioVie disclosed that on April 27, 2021, it had entered into a Purchase Agreement with related party entities NeurMedix and Acuitas, and had acquired certain assets ""including NE3107, a small molecule orally administered inhibitor of insulin resistance and the pathological inflammatory cascade, with a novel mechanism of action that has potential applications for treatment against Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.""

On May 20, 2021, BioVie filed a Notice of Stockholder Action by Written Consent and an accompanying Information Statement on Form 14C providing additional details regarding the acquisition of NeurMedix.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused ""limited access"" to clinical trial sites, significantly affecting the Company's ability to conduct proper oversight of the clinical trial; (2) due to the ""limited access"" to the clinical trial sites, the trial was at higher risk of having ""significant deviation from protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) violations"" and ""anomalous data;"" (3) the Company was experiencing issues with the contract research organizations it had retained, creating greater risk of the trial being in non-compliance with GCPs; (4) the Company had identified ""higher than expected levels of deviations"" in the data; (5) due to a ""highly unusual level of suspected improprieties"" there was a heightened risk a majority of the clinical trial subjects would be excluded; (6) as a result of the exclusions, there was a heightened material risk that the clinical trial would ""not achieve statistical significance;"" and (7) as a result of the foregoing, statements about BioVie's business, operations, prospects, and/or compliance with GCP were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On November 8, 2023, the Company filed its quarterly report with the SEC on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the ""1Q 2023 10-Q""). In the 1Q 2023 10-Q the Company described NE3107's properties and the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial and revealed that the Company ""had uncovered potential scientific misconduct and significant non-compliance with GCPs and regulation at six sites.""

On November 9, 2023, the price of BioVie stock fell to a low of $2.31 per share, down from its closing price of $4.26 the day before. However, BioVie's stock price remained artificially inflated as a result of Defendants' failure to disclose the full extent of the adverse findings regarding the scientific misconduct and significant non-compliance with good clinical practices and regulations.

On November 29, 2023, BioVie filed a Form 8-K with the SEC. The press release accompanying the Form 8-K indicated the Company ""found significant deviation from protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) violations at 15 sites (virtually all of which were from one geographic area)"" and that ""this highly unusual level of suspected improprieties led the Company to exclude all patients from these sites.""

On November 29, 2023, the stock closed at $1.96, down more than 60% from the previous day's closing price of $4.99.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

AlloVir, a clinical-stage cell therapy company, engages in the research and development of allogeneic, off-the-shelf multi-virus specific T cell therapies to prevent and treat devastating viral-associated diseases.

In March 2022, AlloVir initiated global phase 3 registrational studies of its lead product posoleucel for the prevention of life-threatening viral infections from viruses in high-risk, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients (the ""posoleucel Phase 3 Studies"").

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the posoleucel Phase 3 Studies were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints; (ii) as a result, it was likely that the Company would ultimately discontinue the posoleucel Phase 3 studies; (iii) accordingly, AlloVir overstated the efficacy and clinical and/or commercial prospects of posoleucel; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On December 22, 2023, AlloVir announced that it was discontinuing the posoleucel Phase 3 studies over efficacy concerns and stated that it would explore strategic alternatives for the Company. Specifically, AlloVir said it was discontinuing the posoleucel Phase 3 studies after pre-planned analyses concluded they wouldn't meet their primary endpoints.

On this news, AlloVir's stock price fell $1.57 per share, or 67.38%, to close at $0.76 per share on December 22, 2023.

Lantronix is a global industrial and enterprise internet of things (""IoT"") provider of solutions that purportedly target high growth applications in specific verticals such as smart grids, intelligent transportation, smart cities, and artificial intelligence data centers. The Company organizes its products and solutions into three product lines: (i) Embedded IoT Solutions, (ii) IoT System Solutions, and (iii) Software & Services. The Company's sales channels are comprised of distributors, resellers, and direct sales to larger original equipment manufacturers and end users, as well as through its ecommerce site.

In May 2023, Lantronix forecasted that it would achieve revenue in a range of $175 million to $185 million, as well as non-GAAP earnings-per-share (""EPS"") in a range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share, for its fiscal year 2024 results. Defendants repeatedly assured investors and analysts throughout the Class Period that this guidance for fiscal year 2024 remained unchanged, despite knowing that Lantronix's customers were experiencing elevated levels of inventory for IoT products, and that embedded IOT revenues expected from a customer design win were pushed out to the next fiscal year.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Lantronix overstated demand and/or its visibility into demand for its IoT products; (ii) Lantronix's customers were reducing elevated levels of inventory of IoT products, thereby causing a general slowdown in the Company's business; (iii) certain of Lantronix's embedded IOT revenues expected from a customer design win were delayed to the next fiscal year; (iv) as a result of all the foregoing, Lantronix anticipated lower sales for its embedded IOT solutions for fiscal year 2024; (v) accordingly, Lantronix was unlikely to meet its own previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2024; and (vi) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

On February 8, 2024, Lantronix issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024. Therein, the Company negatively revised its fiscal year 2024 guidance, advising that ""[f]or fiscal year 2024, the company [now] expects revenue in a range of $155 million to $165 million"" -- versus the previously provided range of $175 million to $185 million -- ""and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share"" -- versus the previously provided range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. On a call with investors and analysts to discuss these results, Company management revealed that ""[t]he change in our annual guidance is primarily due to lower expected sales for our embedded IOT solutions as a result of two factors"", namely, ""[a] general slowdown in our broad-based channel business as customers work through their inventories, and an embedded compute design win in video applications that was slated for revenue in the second half of fiscal 2024 that pushed into fiscal 2025.""

Following these disclosures, Lantronix's stock price fell $1.89 per share, or 32.53%, to close at $3.92 per share on February 9, 2024.

Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Ville Tavio announced during a press conference that the country's €5 million ($5.4 million) annual contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) would be reinstated, with 10% of the funding reserved for ""risk management.""

""Improving UNRWA's risk management, i.e. starting to prevent abuses and close supervision, gives us sufficient guarantees at this stage from the perspective of risk management that support can continue,"" said Tavio. ""As a result, UNRWA's support for this year will proceed.""

""In the future, UNRWA will also require annual bilateral discussions with Finland on how to improve the efficiency of risk management,"" the minister added. ""It is of paramount importance to ensure that our money does not end up benefiting terrorism.""

Led by the United States, more than a dozen nations including Finland suspended UNRWA funding after Israeli officials accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini terminated nine of the 12 employees accused by Israel. However, Lazzarini later admitted to having no evidence to support their firing, calling the terminations an act of ""reverse due process."" An Israeli dossier cited by countries suspending UNRWA funding also contained no concrete evidence of staff involvement in the October 7 attacks.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) earlier this week called Israeli claims that UNRWA is a Hamas proxy ""flat-out lies.""

UNRWA employees say they were tortured into making false confessions about involvement in Hamas and October 7. The staffers accuse Israeli interrogators of severely beating and waterboarding them, as well as threatening to harm their relatives.

The European Union and nations including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Australia subsequently resumed funding for UNRWA, while other contributors including Saudi Arabia increased their donations.

""For the time being there is no alternative to UNRWA,"" Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Dan Jørgensen said earlier this week.

The United States, however, continues to withhold UNRWA contributions, as do other nations including Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. An agreement reached earlier this week between Congress and the White House as part of a $1.1 trillion militarized spending package extends the ban on UNRWA funding until next March.

On Friday, the House of Representatives voted 286-134 on a bill sanctioning UNRWA while giving Israel $3.8 billion in armed aid. The Biden administration is also seeking an additional $14.3 billion in armed assistance for Israel while repeatedly sidestepping Congress to expedite emergency weapons shipments.

UNRWA supports Palestinian refugees not only in Gaza and the illegally occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, but also in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. In Gaza, agency staff provide shelter, food, water, clothing, blankets, and other essential humanitarian assistance amid Israel's genocidal war and siege, which have killed and maimed more than 113,000 Palestinians while displacing around 90% of the embattled strip's 2.3 million people. With deadly starvation spreading rapidly in Gaza, the agency's work is more needed than ever.

It's perilous work. According to figures from the Aid Worker Security Database, at least 196 humanitarian workers -- most of them UNRWA staffers in Gaza -- have been killed in Palestine since last October. One in every 100 UNRWA workers in Gaza has been killed by Israeli bombs and bullets, the highest toll in United Nations history.",therussophile.org,news,TheRussophiles,,0.0980392156862746,448916728,1,https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1742587975-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,

The deaths have been attributed to people not availing themselves for screening; diagnosis capacity gap among health workers; inadequate screening and diagnostic equipment; late introduction of preventive treatment and stigma.

Coupled with the above, funding to carry out TB control programme is currently limited, with virtually no state commitment.

The disease is transmitted when an infected person with symptoms-active TB- coughs, sings, sneezes, shouts or talks, which releases the TB bacteria into the atmosphere, which is in turn inhaled by people around.

An asymptomatic person living with the condition, known as latent TB, can not transmit but such a person could develop the active TB if his/her immune system gets compromised or breaks down due to other health conditions and poor diet.

The mode of transmission makes everyone vulnerable, a situation which requires that everybody should help to find all persons yet to be diagnosed of TB but living with the condition.

The Manager of the National Tuberculosis Programme, Dr Yaw Adusi-Poku, said everyone was vulnerable to the highly contagious airborne disease, and that all hands must be on deck to put TB under control.

He said people in poorly ventilated or air-conditioned spaces were more vulnerable, and mentioned other risk factors to include people with compromised immune systems such as people living with diabetes, and HIV infection.

He said people who also indulged in substance abuse and people with low body weight were also vulnerable to active TB

Addressing a section of the media at a training programme on TB advocacy in Accra, Dr Adusi-Poku said TB control in the country was heavily dependent on donor funding, particularly on the global fund, a situation he described as worrying and unsustainable.

The training was organised by the Ghana National TB Voice Network (GNTBVN), in partnership with the National TB Control Programme and the Global Fund.

It has been established that the government does not honour its Global Fund Grant Cycle 7 (GC7) co-financing obligation, and has not made any financial commitment to the fight against TB for the next three years as required by the United Nations (UN).

Dr Adusi-Poku said more public and private investments into screening, advocacy and treatment were required to deal with the national TB burden and accelerated interventions.

He said the mode of transmission made everyone vulnerable.",peacefmonline.com,news,Peace Fm Online - Ghana News,,-0.2,448916714,1,https://w5p2r8x5.stackpathcdn.com/photos/news/201407/930282827_905872.jpg,eng-9419170

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress passed the long-overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats boasted of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Marjorie Taylor Greene files surprise motion to oust Speaker Johnson, a sign of growing revolt from the right

By Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Annie Grayer and Kristin Wilson, CNN

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same strategy that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

Jupiter's Rapid Price Rise Signals Bullish Trend

Jupiter's recent one-month price surge of 137.20% paired with a six-month explosion of 3896.00% paints a very bullish picture, showing strong upward momentum. Currently, at $1.20, Jupiter is hovering above both its nearest support of $0.42 and far beyond the second support at $0.30, suggesting a solid uptrend. The price has yet to reach its second resistance at $0.81, implying room for growth. However, with the MACD indicating 'Buy' but the SMA 10-days signaling 'Sell', there's potential short-term volatility. Investors may see these mixed signals as a chance to capitalize on price movements.

In the long-term spectrum, the absence of historical all-time high figures and lack of 100-day SMA data present challenges in forecasting. Investors should weigh the current positive sentiment against the possibility of an overextended rally. With neutrality in the RSI and stochastic actions, market sentiment does not hint at immediate extremes. This neutral stance, amidst such growth, suggests that while the current trend could continue, a cautious approach is advisable, acknowledging the potential for correction after such impressive gains.

Avalanche Growth Trends and Investor Outlook

Avalanche has shown remarkable growth over the past six months, with an increase of 490.48%. This trend points to strong positive momentum, suggesting that its current price of $52.59 may continue to find support from investors aiming for higher returns. The climb towards the second resistance level at $61.66 indicates potential for short-term gains, but reaching the all-time high of $151.22 would require sustained demand and bullish market sentiments. Prices above the 100-day SMA ($40.43) reflect investor confidence which may propel AVAX higher in the near future.

However, a 36.60% rise in the last month alone could signal the market is overheating, which might lead to a correction in the shorter term. If the current price fails to hold, the nearest support levels at $33.98 and $26.97 could be tested, possibly causing a reevaluation of AVAX's growth trajectory among cautious investors. With the 10-day SMA at $55.68 serving as a recent benchmark, any downturn below this could indicate a shift in investor sentiment, posing risks for those holding AVAX for quick gains.

Optimism's Price Movement: A Short-Term Caution Note

Looking at the recent downward movement, with a decrease of around 17% in the last month, this suggests some caution in the short term for Optimism. The drop has positioned the current price at $3.36 beneath the 10-day simple moving average of $3.67. If downward pressure continues, it could test the support levels at $2.95 and even $2.20. Yet, the market has a way of surprising us, and any positive developments could propel the price to challenge the nearest resistance at $4.32, possibly even pushing towards the second resistance level at $4.95.

In the longer view, Optimism's six-month increase of over 158% paints a rosy picture, reflecting strong momentum that could potentially retest the all-time high of $4.87. With the 100-day simple moving average resting at $3.50, slightly above the current price, it could provide a firm foundation for future growth. Market sentiment, always a key driver, could sway the price in either direction; however, the strength shown over the past half-year offers some optimism for a continued upward trajectory.

Conclusion

As other cryptocurrencies like Jupiter, Avalanche, and Optimism position themselves on the crypto stage, each offers notable prospects for growth amidst a burgeoning market. However, none seem to embody the high potential quite like BlastUP. With its deep integration into the Blast ecosystem and a clear purpose of invigorating crypto startups, BlastUP distinguishes itself with robust community support and the incorporation of AI and Web3 innovations. As the presale forges ahead, the excitement surrounding BlastUP's future highlights it as the standout prospect for investors seeking substantial opportunities before the next bull run ignites.

In a statement late Friday, the foundation said it welcomed a government move to contribute to the costs of expanding the terminal at the port of Cuxhaven, on the North Sea coast.

According to Reuters, the government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal, together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), a government spokesperson said on Saturday.

""The expansion of the Cuxhaven port is a central project for the expansion of renewable energies,"" said Stefan Wenzel, parliamentary state secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

The German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation estimates that up to 200 hectares of additional heavy-duty area will be required by the end of the decade just for the construction of new offshore wind farms.

The Senate approved the bill on Saturday morning, clearing the path to Biden's desk by midday.

The package keeps the federal government running through Sept. 30 and includes provisions for the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

It follows months of intense standoffs within the closely divided chambers, whose leaders have constantly argued about issues like border security and aid for Ukraine and Israel.

The new bill cuts all U.S. funding to UNRWA, the chief U.N. agency that provides relief to Palestinians, which came under fire when Israel accused 12 of its 13,000 employees of participating in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Several nations initially paused funding but have since resumed, and the U.N. has launched its own internal investigation into the claims.

The advanced deep-tech battery startup recently raised $40 million as a part of its Series B funding and has an illustrious set of investors ranging from Sequoia Capital India (now Peak XV) to Amara Raja Energy and Petronas. Excerpts below:

The primary business is to basically bring a differentiation when it comes to batteries in India. The fundamental challenge is that the battery technologies that have been created globally were never created keeping in mind India's operating conditions or type of vehicles specifically. Our average temperatures are significantly higher, which can have a considerable impact on battery life, performance, charging time and more.

From that perspective, some factors are unique to our geography, leading to a different level of stress on the battery itself. That creates its own challenges when it comes to designing battery packs for EVs. The driving patterns or road conditions are also stressful and it becomes very important to manage the lifecycle of the battery accordingly. We have to collect data, analyse energy patterns, look at efficiency, and driving behaviour and manage the life of these assets.

So, we are coming up with solutions to create better battery solutions. Starting from the cell chemistry itself, we focus on better battery cells, creating the right kind of battery packs, managing and monitoring these battery packs as they go out in the field, as well as connecting them to manufacturing and looking at the performance of the cells.

When it comes to the manufacturing process, there will not be exact replicas. It will be close to a standard, but there will be deviations. If one doesn't exactly know what the level of deviation is in a battery pack that's going into the field, they will not be able to monitor and manage, as there would be harsh conditions and different cells would start to degrade differently. All of that is something which we're able to manage. That's the innovation that we're doing at the battery pack level.

Commercial vehicles are the ones which spend most of their time on the road. So, that's where there is an expectation of performance and the heavy-duty rugged use case is significantly higher than the personal use case. As we have all this capability from a product manufacturing perspective, from a technology perspective and from a management perspective, we are best suited to enable the electrification of commercial fleets in a far better and more data-driven manner than anybody else in the market.

We not only provide batteries, but we are also able to provide management servicing on the assets, because of the data that we have in the batteries. That's how all the activities of Log9 come together. By leveraging that battery technology, we are able to bring together the ecosystem of commercial fleets.

Many people want to use EVs because they want to curb emissions. However, manufacturing of EVs leads to far more emissions than a fuel-based vehicle, whereas running an EV leads to lesser emissions, as compared to a fuel vehicle.

Well, because commercial vehicle energy efficiency requires a technical solution, not an operational one. The big car companies may not be technology houses; they are product and manufacturing houses. This requires a fresh look at technology in terms of the conditions and the requirements of our local environment. We're the only company that deals with things at the cell level and we're the first ones to have established lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing in the country.

Cell manufacturing is a long-term play which requires process maturity over multiple years. It will enable backward integration for our currently commercial and rapidly scaling battery pack business.

For us, right from the beginning, commercial electric vehicles are what made sense to us, from an economic and climate perspective. It was very clear from the get-go that if we have to build solutions, we have to build for the commercial space. We don't want to sell a battery or an EV just for the sake of it. And when we went to see what was happening in the commercial EV space, we realised that everyone was struggling.

Take a fleet operator, for instance. Say they bought an EV, took financing for it and were promised that the vehicle would last for five years. And let's say there's a warranty for three years. Yet, the battery would end up lasting for only two years and there were defaults in how the operator fulfills EMI obligations. Then, the financier is offering higher interest rates and lower tenures. This was killing the market for EVs, because no one was willing to take responsibility for the lifetime and reliability of the battery itself. So, we began to explore why batteries are failing faster than they were supposed to.

For us, the primary objective is not to create a brand. Our focus has been on what my team and I bring to the table: The technology prowess, not the brand prowess. And the technology will help us create a brand in the long term.

The commercial EV market has a natural sense to it. Consumers are able to see the cost-benefit and efficiency benefits from Day 1. But, at the same time, from the government's point of view, why could it be pushing for EVs? It may be due to better sustainability and helping meet net-zero goals. India would also get more supply chain control in that regard. From those perspectives, the most amount of fuel is used by commercial makers. So, minimising fuel imports is viable for commercial usage. And because it's the commercial vehicles that lead to a net-positive climate impact, it serves a net-zero goal as well.

I think you're definitely solving a much larger and much deeper-rooted problem. And you're very clear that the go-to-market has to be the commercial segment. So, why is there a need for capital for your company? Because, unlike a consumer-facing company, you don't have huge cash burns to build a brand, right?

Well, technology is not cheap, it's significantly expensive. Running a facility every month costs a million dollars, plus you have to keep in mind the kind of people that you have to hire, the people who understand the technology and who have the right credentials, who conduct R&D and constantly improve the technology and more. It's a costly affair. That's where the investment goes.

And if you look at our monthly burn, 70% of it is directly attributable to technology and further advancement. So, it's a way of creating strength and building for the future. You can leverage that for future growth of the business and the company itself. This is a costly industry in that regard and is very similar to the kind of cost structure seen in the semiconductor industry. Think about it: Why don't we have enough semiconductor research and manufacturing happening in India? Maybe, because research and production, even at a pilot level, require a lot of money.

There are a couple of aspects to this. One is the cell, another is the battery pack, and the third is management and data analysis. The cell level is at the pilot scale, where we have created the technology. The battery pack level is already at a commercial scale. We earned a revenue of $10 million last year and we'll be doing a revenue of more than $15 million in FY24.

We are consistently improving our margin profile by optimising supply chains, improving product designs and automating our manufacturing processes. This is being done with a target to become cash flow positive in the next 18 months.

We have about 10 different Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) across the two-wheeler, three-wheeler and four-wheeler categories to which we provide these batteries. When the vehicles are made and have to be deployed with commercial fleets, we, again come in because we understand what is happening with the battery, what battery was manufactured, what was the condition of that battery and more. We collect dynamic and real-time data with about 30 variable data points for every second for every battery deployed in the field.

So, imagine the intensity of the data that we're getting every second from across 25 cities where our products are running today from across the country. All the data helps us manage the entire ecosystem. Using the data, we're able to bring together charge point operators, because we know how many vehicles would need charging and where.

And financiers have a better view of how the asset is being used, how long it will run and how long is the life cycle: So, they are reassured. And if all the data is there, we can do predictive maintenance. We know if there's some issue that is coming up in the vehicle because we're monitoring the efficiency of the vehicle; if it is underperforming, then, probably, there's some issue coming up and we could intervene.

A gigafactory would come up and our technology would also flow into the gigafactory. But, setting up a gigafactory has multiple challenges and it's not a technology issue for us, because we've created the technology and we've tested and validated it. The issue, in terms of a gigafactory risk, is the Chinese scale, which is constantly growing. About 85% of all manufacturing in the world takes place in China. We also have to think about whether policies would be aligned to be competitive with this Chinese scale. And even with high capex and high risk, in this case, the margins are razor thin.

Well, at a large scale, the risk becomes higher. But I have to take a ₹2000 crore bet today. If I am taking that kind of financial risk, the reward has to be significantly high. And I need to have more visibility. I cannot just take an uninformed bet or an experimental bet at that kind of scale. That is why the entire industry is treading cautiously on this front, even people who have all the money in the world. Even if the capital is available, you have to be smart about it.

Well, there has to be absolute clarity, in terms of how policy will shape up and how it will be in support of local manufacturing to happen. If there's an expectation that the industry should take a punt and move forward without clarity from the government, that's not going to work. And we keep on talking about having a technological edge and being self-reliant, but where is the investment and support in terms of R&D?

If you look at any battery company in China or the US, the first $10 million to $20 million is money that comes directly from the government. And that creates a launchpad for investing in technology and building it further. We don't have that here.

That may help, but is it coming out? Because it has not happened so far. However, increased customs duties on Chinese imports are highly anticipated to support local manufacturing.

So, scaling a company in India purely based on technology is something which has not happened and which is not easy to do. Startups in India are not funded on a disproportionate outcome with a willingness to take failure as it comes. Our system is not designed for high-risk high-reward situations. Everybody wants to play it safe. From that perspective, there's an expectation to get to market within a year or a couple of years, start churning revenue and build on that. And that's the reality of our ecosystem. Hence, building nodes which are revenue-churning and commercial became very evident to us.

Well, that's the unfortunate part of the Indian ecosystem. When you're at a board level or investor level, the thinking is x revenue tomorrow and y profitability tomorrow. But, we have to live in the ecosystem that we're born with. We can be a bit cynical, critical or upset about it. But, we've decided, as a team, to be based in India.

So, we're talking to many financial investors and we have strategies in place. But the investor lens can change. An investor who invests $10 million in a battery R&D or deep tech company in the US would come to India and be enamoured by downstream deployment deals, rather than fundamental R&D deals. I've seen this time and again talking to global investors.

True. And we've chosen our investors very cautiously in that manner in terms of how they're aligned with our business and our technology roadmap. Current schemes are not enough to compete with Chinese prices in the long run. Also, the current subsidies have been long delayed and erratic.

Among other things, being closer to the customer or the market is something I had to do. It's a very big comfort zone sitting in a lab and doing your own thing, where what you're making is the best. But, when you go out there in the market, you understand walking the tightrope to balance technology and its price viability. That's where the rubber hits the road in that regard.

The way it works in any innovation space, you try 10 different things. And as per the nature of innovation, 8 won't work out. Instead of getting disheartened by 8 negative outcomes, you have to remember that 2 will work and make up for the failure of 8. For us, from the very beginning, we stuck to the ""why"" and we tried a lot of things to get to the ""how"".

Well, there's always a Plan B for us. We'll keep on trying 10 different things. We're staying true to our ""why"", which is using technology to solve climate change. What we're doing to create that impact is dependent on a lot of market dynamics, as well as in terms of what is working and what is not working, what changed and more. So, you have to keep up with micro-trends, but stay core to your ""why"".",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,0.1294117647058823,448916329,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/23/1600x900/00c4a526-225e-11ed-bd16-fd5d5a2dd74b_1662405267752_1711217915373.jpg,

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the U.S. Senate passed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, which contains significant resources to support important institutions and programs in Kentucky. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator McConnell advocated on behalf of the Commonwealth in this year's government funding process. The measure passed both the Senate and the House and was signed into law by the President.

The legislation completes the annual appropriations process for six major areas of the federal government: defense, legislative branch, financial services, homeland security, state-foreign operations, and labor, health and human services, and education.

""The Senate's legislation fulfills our essential government funding responsibilities to the nation and delivers on some of my home state's top priorities. In Kentucky, we're facing one of the deadliest overdose epidemics on record, largely driven by opioid addiction. I'm proud our legislation secures billions in funding to combat the substance use epidemic, promote long-term recovery, and find new ways to treat addiction,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""It also brings home critical resources for longtime Kentucky priorities, like furthering medical research and expanding learning opportunities for the blind. With the programs and funding provided in this legislation, Kentuckians are well-positioned to build a safer and more prosperous future.""

""The federal funding secured by Leader McConnell continues to make a profound impact in providing Kentuckians with life-saving, life-changing treatment. These appropriations will go a long way toward getting more people struggling with addiction on the road to long-term recovery. We are grateful to have a champion like Leader McConnell in Washington and are incredibly thankful for his long track record of supporting Kentucky providers, like Addiction Recovery Care, in the fight against the opioid and substance use epidemics,"" said Addiction Recovery Care founder/CEO Tim Robinson.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.2784313725490195,448916020,1,,

Washington D.C. -- Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) voted to avert a partial government shutdown and secured major investments for Georgia in the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY '24) second minibus government funding bill, which includes the final six of the twelve bills necessary to fully fund the government through FY '24.

""A budget is not just a fiscal document, it's a moral document,"" said Senator Reverend Warnock.""I fought hard to ensure this legislation makes strong investments that will lower child care costs, support small businesses, strengthen rural health care and more, and I'm proud it reflects my commitment to serving Georgians from Rome to Valdosta.""

The second minibus legislation championed by Senator Warnock will lower child care costs for working families and provide robust funding to Head Start, bolster funding for schools in low-income areas, provide equipment and facility upgrades for rural health care clinics and hospitals, strengthen support for small businesses, boost servicemember pay and more. The legislation now goes to the President to be signed into law.

The Senator continued: ""This government funding legislation is vital for small businesses, health care providers, families, and servicemembers across Georgia and I'm glad we finally fully funded the government for the fiscal year, but let's be clear-we are almost six months behind in passing this bill, and it never should have gotten to this point. A group of partisan extreme politicians almost let politics prevent Congress from fulfilling our essential responsibility to fund the government, which should be a bipartisan priority. I'm glad cooler heads prevailed but this is not a sustainable way to govern.""

In addition to championing investments to fully fund vital federal programs, Senator Warnock also successfully secured $227 million for 96 projects requested by communities across the state through Congressionally-Directed Spending (CDS) across both spending bills.

""After months of working with leaders and stakeholders across Georgia, and pushing my colleagues in Washington, I'm especially proud to have secured $227 million in direct funding for 96 projects in communities across our state. It just goes to show that when we center people in our public policy, we have a better chance of getting the policy right,"" Senator Reverend Warnock added.

Passage of this legislation comes after the Senate passed the first six FY '24 government funding bills on March 11, containing provisions championed by Senator Warnock to improve affordable housing access, protect vital nutritional assistance for children and families, provide infrastructure upgrades for communities across the state, and more. Read more about investments and policies Senator Warnock secured for Georgia in the first FY '24 minibus government funding bill HERE.

Key programmatic investments Senator Reverend Warnock supported in the government funding legislation include:

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

Biden signing the bill into law means the government is now funded through the end of fiscal 2024. Congress and the White House will have just over six months to agree to funding for the next fiscal year.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" a White House statement read.

It's time to get this done.""

The bill Biden signed on Saturday funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, State, Education, and the legislative branch. It was passed by the House of Representatives, 286-134, on Friday and by the Senate, 74-24, just after 2 a.m. EDT on Saturday.

While the funding was signed into law hours after the partial shutdown deadline of midnight Saturday, the White House confirmed shortly after the deadline that the affected agencies would not be shut down due to the short lapse in funding.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday. Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement early Saturday, per the press pool.

The spending bill signed into law on Saturday ends a tumultuous appropriations process for fiscal 2024, which was dominated by disorder and several interim stopgaps.

Ahead of the original deadline of midnight Oct. 1, 2023, the House and Senate were able to pass a stopgap to fund the government an additional 45 days, but then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) reliance on Democratic support to avert a shutdown prompted anger by some in the GOP conference. McCarthy was ousted from the speakership days later, after an effort led by eight Republicans and all Democrats in the chamber.

That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

The joint statement highlighted that since Bhutan's First Five-Year Plan in 1961, India's development partnership with Bhutan has been empowering the people and ensuring development across sectors and regions.

""Our development partnership is a confluence of India's approach of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' and the philosophy of Gross National Happiness in Bhutan,"" it added.

Both countries also affirmed their commitment to continue to expand the development partnership in line with the priorities of the people, the Bhutan government and the King of Bhutan.

India and Bhutan welcomed the Joint Vision Statement on the India-Bhutan Energy Partnership and said that the energy cooperation between the two countries results in mutually beneficial outcomes.

""We will continue to expand our clean energy partnership in the sectors of hydropower, solar and green hydrogen and jointly develop new projects, which channel our technological prowess, the vibrancy of the business sector, and skilled talent of both countries to enhance energy security in the region,"" it added.

Both countries are further committed to harnessing technologies for rapid economic growth and promoting the well-being of the people of India and Bhutan.

""Bharat has entered a new chapter in its history, one which is characterised by rapid socio-economic progress and technological advancements, and striving to become a developed nation by 2047 in the Amrit Kaal. Bhutan has the vision to become a high-income nation by 2034 and is embarking on a new phase in its economic development. In the common quest for progress and prosperity, Bharat and Bhutan will continue to be the closest of friends and partners,"" the joint statement added.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the U.S. Senate passed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, which contains significant resources to support important institutions and programs in Kentucky. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator McConnell advocated on behalf of the Commonwealth in this year's government funding process. The measure passed both the Senate and the House and was signed into law by the President.

The legislation completes the annual appropriations process for six major areas of the federal government: defense, legislative branch, financial services, homeland security, state-foreign operations, and labor, health and human services, and education.

""The Senate's legislation fulfills our essential government funding responsibilities to the nation and delivers on some of my home state's top priorities. In Kentucky, we're facing one of the deadliest overdose epidemics on record, largely driven by opioid addiction. I'm proud our legislation secures billions in funding to combat the substance use epidemic, promote long-term recovery, and find new ways to treat addiction,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""It also brings home critical resources for longtime Kentucky priorities, like furthering medical research and expanding learning opportunities for the blind. With the programs and funding provided in this legislation, Kentuckians are well-positioned to build a safer and more prosperous future.""

""The federal funding secured by Leader McConnell continues to make a profound impact in providing Kentuckians with life-saving, life-changing treatment. These appropriations will go a long way toward getting more people struggling with addiction on the road to long-term recovery. We are grateful to have a champion like Leader McConnell in Washington and are incredibly thankful for his long track record of supporting Kentucky providers, like Addiction Recovery Care, in the fight against the opioid and substance use epidemics,"" said Addiction Recovery Care founder/CEO Tim Robinson.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress passed the long-overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

Democrats boasted of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Marjorie Taylor Greene files surprise motion to oust Speaker Johnson, a sign of growing revolt from the right

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same strategy that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown. The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight. But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday. It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

The Senate approved the bill on Saturday morning, clearing the path to Biden's desk by midday.

The package keeps the federal government running through Sept. 30 and includes provisions for the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

It follows months of intense standoffs within the closely divided chambers, whose leaders have constantly argued about issues like border security and aid for Ukraine and Israel.

The new bill cuts all U.S. funding to UNRWA, the chief U.N. agency that provides relief to Palestinians, which came under fire when Israel accused 12 of its 13,000 employees of participating in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Several nations initially paused funding but have since resumed, and the U.N. has launched its own internal investigation into the claims.

The White House announced the signing on Saturday after the US Senate approved the package in the early morning hours. That ended a partisan tug-of-war, marked by repeated infighting among Republicans over amendments. With a midnight deadline looming, Senate leaders beat back efforts by conservative Republicans to enact deep spending cuts and restrictions on migration.

Biden applauded passage of the funding package, but also prodded lawmakers to approve assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies that has been stalled for months, as well as a measure that would tighten security at the US-Mexico border.

""I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday.

NATO's top civilian official said last week that Ukraine is ""running out of ammunition,"" echoing warnings by the country's allies, including the US.

The funding package increases defense appropriations by 3% while keeping overall domestic spending flat. Temporary spending measures had funded the federal government for the first six months of the federal fiscal year.

Though the Senate session dragged past midnight, the White House said it was ending preparations for a shutdown. Federal agencies weren't affected by the short lapse because ""obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis,"" it said in a statement.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said as he announcing a deal to end a Republican filibuster, clearing the way for the bill to pass the Senate on a 74-24 vote.

The House had passed the bill 286 to 134, though a majority of Republicans voted against it.

As the United States doubled down on banning funds for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, Finland said Friday that it would resume contributions to the lifesaving organization in an implicit rebuke of unsubstantiated Israeli claims -- reportedly extracted via torture -- that staff members were involved in the October 7 attacks.

Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Ville Tavio announced during a press conference that the country's €5 million ($5.4 million) annual contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) would be reinstated, with 10% of the funding reserved for ""risk management.""

""Improving UNRWA's risk management, i.e. starting to prevent abuses and close supervision, gives us sufficient guarantees at this stage from the perspective of risk management that support can continue,"" said Tavio. ""As a result, UNRWA's support for this year will proceed.""

""In the future, UNRWA will also require annual bilateral discussions with Finland on how to improve the efficiency of risk management,"" the minister added. ""It is of paramount importance to ensure that our money does not end up benefiting terrorism.""

Led by the United States, more than a dozen nations including Finland suspended UNRWA funding after Israeli officials accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini terminated nine of the 12 employees accused by Israel. However, Lazzarini later admitted to having no evidence to support their firing, calling the terminations an act of ""reverse due process."" An Israeli dossier cited by countries suspending UNRWA funding also contained no concrete evidence of staff involvement in the October 7 attacks.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) earlier this week called Israeli claims that UNRWA is a Hamas proxy ""flat-out lies.""

UNRWA employees say they were tortured into making false confessions about involvement in Hamas and October 7. The staffers accuse Israeli interrogators of severely beating and waterboarding them, as well as threatening to harm their relatives.

The European Union and nations including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Australia subsequently resumed funding for UNRWA, while other contributors including Saudi Arabia increased their donations.

""For the time being there is no alternative to UNRWA,"" Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Dan Jørgensen said earlier this week.

The United States, however, continues to withhold UNRWA contributions, as do other nations including Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. An agreement reached earlier this week between Congress and the White House as part of a $1.1 trillion militarized spending package extends the ban on UNRWA funding until next March.

On Friday, the House of Representatives voted 286-134 on a bill sanctioning UNRWA while giving Israel $3.8 billion in armed aid. The Biden administration is also seeking an additional $14.3 billion in armed assistance for Israel while repeatedly sidestepping Congress to expedite emergency weapons shipments.

UNRWA supports Palestinian refugees not only in Gaza and the illegally occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, but also in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. In Gaza, agency staff provide shelter, food, water, clothing, blankets, and other essential humanitarian assistance amid Israel's genocidal war and siege, which have killed and maimed more than 113,000 Palestinians while displacing around 90% of the embattled strip's 2.3 million people. With deadly starvation spreading rapidly in Gaza, the agency's work is more needed than ever.

It's perilous work. According to figures from the Aid Worker Security Database, at least 196 humanitarian workers -- most of them UNRWA staffers in Gaza -- have been killed in Palestine since last October. One in every 100 UNRWA workers in Gaza has been killed by Israeli bombs and bullets, the highest toll in United Nations history.",truthout.org,news,Truthout,Brett Wilkins,0.1215686274509804,448914450,1,https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1742587975-scaled.jpg,eng-9412421

Biden signing the bill into law means the government is now funded through the end of fiscal 2024. Congress and the White House will have just over six months to agree to funding for the next fiscal year.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" a White House statement read. ""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted. But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include. That's good news for the American people.

""But I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

The bill Biden signed on Saturday funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, State, Education, and the legislative branch. It was passed by the House of Representatives, 286-134, on Friday and by the Senate, 74-24, just after 2 a.m. EDT on Saturday.

While the funding was signed into law hours after the partial shutdown deadline of midnight Saturday, the White House confirmed shortly after the deadline that the affected agencies would not be shut down due to the short lapse in funding.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday. Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement early Saturday, per the press pool.

The spending bill signed into law on Saturday ends a tumultuous appropriations process for fiscal 2024, which was dominated by disorder and several interim stopgaps.

Ahead of the original deadline of midnight Oct. 1, 2023, the House and Senate were able to pass a stopgap to fund the government an additional 45 days, but then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) reliance on Democratic support to avert a shutdown prompted anger by some in the GOP conference. McCarthy was ousted from the speakership days later, after an effort led by eight Republicans and all Democrats in the chamber.

Less than half a year later, Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has filed a motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) over his bipartisan agreement to fund the government through fiscal 2024, among other matters.

A specific timetable for when the motion will be voted on, or if it would pass, is currently unknown, but it appears likely to be dealt with when the House returns from recess in April.

He further added, ""Congress's work isn't finished. It's time to get this done.""

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

While The House passed the legislation with a bipartisan 286-134 vote, the Senate passed it in a 74-24 vote.

According to The Hill, although the bill was signed by the president after Friday's deadline at midnight, the Office of Management and Budget stopped preparing for a shutdown as soon as it became apparent that Biden would soon receive the bill.

The funding package maintains flat domestic spending overall but increases defense appropriations by 3%. For the first half of the federal fiscal year, the federal government was funded by temporary spending measures.

This law represents the second phase of a two-phase government funding scheme. Funding was provided for the Food and Drug Administration, military construction, the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and other federal programs by a different six-bill funding package that was signed into law earlier this month.

Amid this legislative frenzy, another contentious issue looms large in Congress.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

Here, we take a look at some of the latest headlines from around the Championship:

Manchester United and Brighton have emerged as potential suitors for Leicester City midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, according to 90min. The Foxes have let slip a huge lead at the top of the Championship table and have been charged by the Premier League for breaching financial rules.

According to reports, Dewsbury-Hall could be allowed to leave the King Power Stadium this summer in order to help the club comply with these financial constraints and would demand a sizable fee of around £40m. However, the reports also state that he could be sold for as little as £25m if Leicester do not seal promotion back to the Premier League this season.

Leeds United striker Mateo Joseph has praised Daniel Farke's role in his development at Elland Road this season. The 20-year-old was injured at the beginning of the campaign, but retained the support of his manager and returned the favour with a brace against Chelsea in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge last month.

Speaking about his manager and the difficulties he has had to overcome at Elland Road, Joseph said: ""It's been a difficult process. At the beginning of the season, I was with the team, but I got injured. He always gave me the truth, told me to stay patient because my moment would come.

""It's true. He didn't lie. It's been really good and I cannot wait to keep working under him and achieve things here.""

Sunderland face Farke's Leeds at Elland Road on Tuesday 9 April. Kick-off is at 8pm that night.

(""Innoviz"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: INVZ) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 24-cv-01971 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Innoviz securities between April 21, 2021 and February 28, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

Innoviz designs and manufactures solid-state light detection and ranging, or ""LiDAR"", sensors and develops perception software that purportedly enables the mass production of autonomous vehicles. The Company operates in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and North America.

Shortly after Innoviz began publicly trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in April 2021, the Company represented that it had entered into multiple contracts, partnerships, and/or collaborations with several noteworthy automotive original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") throughout the world. These relationships, the Company claimed, would purportedly ""uniquely position"" Innoviz to make autonomous driving a commercial reality, and could be ""leveraged to penetrate and partner with other OEMs customers and Tier-1 suppliers."" For example, Innoviz touted that the Company's ""intense sustained cooperation with BMW [. . .] provides [its] engineers and other R&D personnel with a valuable competitive edge"" and that ""[t]he compelling nature of [the Company's] approach and solution is demonstrated by [its] agreements with four Tier-1 suppliers, including Aptiv and Magna, both of which invested in [Innoviz], and Harman and Hirain, as well [Innoviz's] 2018 selection by BMW to supply [the Company's] automotive grade InnovizOne sensor for integration into new vehicle builds.""

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Innoviz had overstated the benefits that the Company was likely to derive from its purported contracts, partnerships, and/or collaborations with automotive companies; (ii) as a result, the Company was unlikely to achieve the level of profitability that Defendants had represented to investors; (iii) accordingly, Innoviz had overstated its business and/or financial prospects; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On March 1, 2023, during pre-market hours, Innoviz issued a press release announcing the Company's financial and operational results for its fiscal full year (""FY"") 2022. Among other items, Innoviz reported GAAP FY 2022 earnings per share of -$0.94, missing consensus estimates by $0.06, and revenue of $6.03 million, missing consensus estimates by $0.96 million. In addition, Innoviz guided for FY 2023 revenue to fall in the range of $12 million to $15 million, significantly below consensus estimates of $30 million. The Company's disappointing FY 2022 results came as a surprise to investors given that Innoviz had previously extolled the benefits it would derive from its various partnerships with purported ""Tier-1 companies."" Indeed, after a multi-year period of announcing partnerships with various automotive companies throughout the world, the press release reporting the Company' FY 2022 results said conspicuously little about these supposed collaborations, referencing only its partnerships with BMW and Volkswagen.

On this news, Innoviz's ordinary share price fell $0.71 per share, or 14.95%, to close at $4.04 per share on March 1, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (""RVC"") products sold under the ""Roomba"" brand name.

In August 2022, iRobot and Amazon.com, Inc. (""Amazon""), which sells iRobot's RVCs on its online marketplace, announced their entry into a definitive merger agreement (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which Amazon would ""acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including iRobot's net debt"" (the ""Merger"").

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Merger would place Amazon in a sufficiently dominant position in the market for RVCs that U.S. and European antitrust regulators were unlikely to approve the Merger; (ii) iRobot had conducted inadequate due diligence into the Merger and/or ignored significant risks weighing against the likelihood of regulatory approval; (iii) as a result of all the foregoing, iRobot overstated the likelihood for successfully completing the Merger; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On June 22, 2023, news outlets reported that Europe's antitrust regulator, the European Commission (""EC""), was planning to launch a full-scale investigation into the Merger.

On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $4.12 per share, or 8.32%, to close at $45.41 per share on June 22, 2023.

On November 27, 2023, the EC announced that it ""has informed Amazon of its preliminary view that its proposed acquisition of iRobot may restrict competition in the market for [RVCs]."" In particular, the EC advised that, ""[a]s a result of [its] in-depth investigation, the [EC] is concerned that Amazon may restrict competition in the European Economic Area ('EEA')-wide and/or national markets for RVCs, by hampering rival RVC suppliers' ability to effectively compete"" (emphasis in original).

On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $7.13 per share, or 17.19%, to close at $34.35 per share on November 27, 2023.

On January 10, 2024, news outlets reported that Amazon did not offer concessions to the EC to appease the regulator's concerns about the Merger. For example, POLITICO reported that day that ""[t]he European Union's webpage on the deal shows that the companies didn't make an offer by the end of the day on Wednesday, its last chance to tackle European Union objections that Amazon could hamper rival vacuum cleaners' sales on Amazon's online marketplace.""

On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $7.33 per share, or 19.77%, to close at $29.75 per share on January 10, 2024.

On January 18, 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that ""[t]he European Union's competition watchdog intends to block Amazon's $1.7 billion bid to purchase Roomba maker iRobot,"" citing ""people familiar with the matter[.]""

On January 19, 2024, Bloomberg separately reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") was drafting a lawsuit to block the Merger.

Following these reports, iRobot's stock price fell $6.36 per share, or 26.93%, to close at $17.26 per share on January 19, 2024.

Then, on January 29, 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced their entry ""into a mutual agreement"" to terminate the previously announced Merger. Concurrently, iRobot announced the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, as well as plans to cut approximately 31% of its workforce.

Later the same day, Reuters reported that FTC staff had notified Amazon the week before that it planned to block the Merger.

Following these disclosures, iRobot's stock price fell $1.49 per share, or 8.77%, to close at $15.50 per share on January 29, 2024.

NEW YORK, March 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against BioVie Inc. (""BioVie"" or the ""Company"") BIVI and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States (""U.S."") District Court for the District of Nevada, and docketed under 24-cv-00361, is on behalf of persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded BioVie securities from August 5, 2021 through November 29, 2023, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). Plaintiff seeks to recover compensable damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"").

BioVie is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that purports to engage in the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative drugs therapies, including for treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and advanced liver disease.

Prior to the Class Period, in its 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on May 10, 2021, BioVie disclosed that on April 27, 2021, it had entered into a Purchase Agreement with related party entities NeurMedix and Acuitas, and had acquired certain assets ""including NE3107, a small molecule orally administered inhibitor of insulin resistance and the pathological inflammatory cascade, with a novel mechanism of action that has potential applications for treatment against Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.""

On May 20, 2021, BioVie filed a Notice of Stockholder Action by Written Consent and an accompanying Information Statement on Form 14C providing additional details regarding the acquisition of NeurMedix.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused ""limited access"" to clinical trial sites, significantly affecting the Company's ability to conduct proper oversight of the clinical trial; (2) due to the ""limited access"" to the clinical trial sites, the trial was at higher risk of having ""significant deviation from protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) violations"" and ""anomalous data;"" (3) the Company was experiencing issues with the contract research organizations it had retained, creating greater risk of the trial being in non-compliance with GCPs; (4) the Company had identified ""higher than expected levels of deviations"" in the data; (5) due to a ""highly unusual level of suspected improprieties"" there was a heightened risk a majority of the clinical trial subjects would be excluded; (6) as a result of the exclusions, there was a heightened material risk that the clinical trial would ""not achieve statistical significance;"" and (7) as a result of the foregoing, statements about BioVie's business, operations, prospects, and/or compliance with GCP were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On November 8, 2023, the Company filed its quarterly report with the SEC on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the ""1Q 2023 10-Q""). In the 1Q 2023 10-Q the Company described NE3107's properties and the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial and revealed that the Company ""had uncovered potential scientific misconduct and significant non-compliance with GCPs and regulation at six sites.""

On November 9, 2023, the price of BioVie stock fell to a low of $2.31 per share, down from its closing price of $4.26 the day before. However, BioVie's stock price remained artificially inflated as a result of Defendants' failure to disclose the full extent of the adverse findings regarding the scientific misconduct and significant non-compliance with good clinical practices and regulations.

On November 29, 2023, BioVie filed a Form 8-K with the SEC. The press release accompanying the Form 8-K indicated the Company ""found significant deviation from protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) violations at 15 sites (virtually all of which were from one geographic area)"" and that ""this highly unusual level of suspected improprieties led the Company to exclude all patients from these sites.""

On November 29, 2023, the stock closed at $1.96, down more than 60% from the previous day's closing price of $4.99.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

AlloVir, a clinical-stage cell therapy company, engages in the research and development of allogeneic, off-the-shelf multi-virus specific T cell therapies to prevent and treat devastating viral-associated diseases.

In March 2022, AlloVir initiated global phase 3 registrational studies of its lead product posoleucel for the prevention of life-threatening viral infections from viruses in high-risk, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients (the ""posoleucel Phase 3 Studies"").

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the posoleucel Phase 3 Studies were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints; (ii) as a result, it was likely that the Company would ultimately discontinue the posoleucel Phase 3 studies; (iii) accordingly, AlloVir overstated the efficacy and clinical and/or commercial prospects of posoleucel; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On December 22, 2023, AlloVir announced that it was discontinuing the posoleucel Phase 3 studies over efficacy concerns and stated that it would explore strategic alternatives for the Company. Specifically, AlloVir said it was discontinuing the posoleucel Phase 3 studies after pre-planned analyses concluded they wouldn't meet their primary endpoints.

On this news, AlloVir's stock price fell $1.57 per share, or 67.38%, to close at $0.76 per share on December 22, 2023.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

Maybe not where you think?

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats boasted of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" he said. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same strategy that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The House passed the bills on Friday.

The package, approved on a Senate vote of 74-24, funds the federal government until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

Biden applauded the bipartisan package, but said Congress had more work to do on national security and border legislation.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement released by the White House. ""That's good news for the American people.""

""It has been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Friday night before the vote. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

Minutes after the clock struck midnight -- the deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown -- the White House weighed in.

""[The Office of Management and Budget] has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement given to the press pool. ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

The funding package includes defense, homeland security, financial services and general government, labor-HHS, the legislative branch, and state-foreign operations. The bills needed two-thirds support in the House and was approved on a vote of 286-134.

The Friday House vote could have consequences for Speaker Mike Johnson. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to remove him as Speaker.

There were warning signs Thursday night that the vote may be tighter than GOP leadership expected.

Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., who chairs the Labor-HHS subcommittee, said he'd be voting against the package because of earmarks senators on both sides of the aisle inserted into the bill.

""This is not the bill that my subcommittee produced and supported. The Senate has taken liberties with their Congressionally Directed Spending requests that would never stand in the House,"" he said in a statement.

Republican members also expressed disappointment that the package didn't go further on strengthening the Southern border and criticized the narrow timeframe between the 1000+ page text's release early Thursday morning and the Friday vote.

But Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on defense, urged his colleagues to vote for the package.

""Every member must understand the impact of not passing this package. The only other option will be a full year continuing resolution, which will devastate our national security and put our country at risk,"" he said ahead of the House vote. ""A no vote is a vote for China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Hamas.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, and education, said the package represents a compromise.

""This legislation does not have everything either side may have wanted,"" she said. ""But I am satisfied that many of the extreme cuts and the policies proposed by House Republicans were rejected.""

She noted her work with other House and Senate Appropriators -- Rep. Kay Granger of Texas and Sens. Collins of Maine and Murray of Washington ""marks the first time negotiations on government funding have been led on all four corners by women.""

The package has wins for both Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans are touting an increase in the number of ICE detention beds and border agents and cutting funding to NGOs. They're also trumpeting a provision that prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from banning gas stoves and another that prevents diplomatic facilities from flying flags that aren't official U.S. flags.

Democrats are praising a $1 billion increase for childcare and early learning programs, including $12 billion for the Head Start program.

Another provision getting a lot of attention is the measure that halts funding for UNWRA, the United Nations Agency that provides aid to Palestinians, until March of 2025. This comes after Israel alleged that a dozen UNWRA staffers took part in Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.

Under House rules, it only takes one lawmaker to bring up a vote to oust the speaker. Greene's motion to remove Johnson, months after House Republicans ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is not privileged, meaning it's unclear if or when it will be brought to the floor for a vote.

Johnson presides over a razor thin, one-vote majority, with Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck resigning from the House on Friday and Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher announcing Friday he's resigning effective April 19.

Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., told reporters ahead of the vote that he blames Johnson for bringing the package to the floor for a vote in the first place. He said he didn't want to talk about personnel issues within GOP leadership, but said he ""can't defend the speaker.""

Johnson's challenge only deepens next month as the House will debate funding for Ukraine, an issue that divides his conference.",kpbs.org,news,KPBS,,0.3176470588235294,448914059,1,https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/e1a41b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+563/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F03%2F23%2Fgettyimages-2099945246-1-1-245f82bc1c2437ab1686ad5a58f7fabd2aa30f0a.jpg,

The Senate approved the bill on Saturday morning, clearing the path to Biden's desk by midday.

The package keeps the federal government running through Sept. 30 and includes provisions for the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

It follows months of intense standoffs within the closely divided chambers, whose leaders have constantly argued about issues like border security and aid for Ukraine and Israel.

The new bill cuts all U.S. funding to UNRWA, the chief U.N. agency that provides relief to Palestinians, which came under fire when Israel accused 12 of its 13,000 employees of participating in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.

NEW YORK, March 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against B. Riley Financial, Inc. (""B. Riley"" or the ""Company"") RILY and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and docketed under 24-cv-02121, is on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired B. Riley securities between February 28, 2022 and November 9, 2023, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). Plaintiff pursues claims against the Defendants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"").

B. Riley is a financial services platform. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides services including investment banking, brokerage, wealth management, asset management, direct lending, business advisory, valuation, and asset disposition. B. Riley's clients include public and private companies, financial sponsors, investors, financial institutions, and individuals.

Brian Kahn (""Kahn"") is a client of B. Riley. Kahn is the Chief Executive Officer of Franchise Group, Inc. f/k/a Liberty Tax (""FRG""), which B. Riley has had dealings with since at least 2018. B. Riley has provided significant funds to FRG and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, and/or other entities controlled by Kahn, since at least December 2021. FRG is a holding company which acquires and manages companies, primarily franchises. FRG's businesses include Vitamin Shoppe, Pet Supplies Plus, and Buddy's Newco LLC (d/b/a Buddy's Home Furnishings) (""Buddy's""), among others.

In May 2023, B. Riley entered into an agreement to assist Kahn in leading a management buyout of FRG. The $2.8 billion deal to take FRG private was completed on August 21, 2023. The transaction was partially financed by Nomura Holdings Inc. (""Nomura"") via B. Riley, who secured the financing allowing Kahn and other senior management of FRG to acquire the remaining 64% stake that they did not already own.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (i) Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Kahn and/or one or more of his controlled entities were engaged in illicit business activities; (ii) Kahn had been credibly implicated in a conspiracy to defraud investors of millions of dollars; (iii) in spite of all the foregoing, B. Riley continued to finance the transaction enabling Kahn and others to take FRG private through complex arrangements; (iv) the foregoing was reasonably likely to draw regulatory scrutiny to B. Riley; and (v) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On November 2, 2023, Kahn was implicated as the unnamed co-conspirator in a conspiracy to defraud investors of $294 million in funds. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") announced that Prophecy Asset Management (""Prophecy"") president John Hughes (""Hughes"") had pled guilty to the charge with two unnamed co-defendants. The same day, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Hughes in connection with these allegations, styled Securities and Exchange Commission v. John Hughes, No. 3:23-cv-21816 (D.N.J. filed November 2, 2023) (the ""SEC Complaint""). The SEC Complaint, inter alia, implicated, among others, both Kahn and Buddy's in the alleged conspiracy to defraud investors. Bloomberg reported on that same day that Kahn had been identified by ""a person familiar with the matter"" as one of two co-conspirators.

On November 3, 2023, after the market closed, The Friendly Bear posted on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), doubting whether B. Riley knew of Kahn's involvement and disclosed the same to Nomura. The Friendly Bear also commented that the DOJ's ""charging document clearly implicates him [i.e., Kahn] in Hughes' crime. There is a high chance of indictment here.""

On this news, B. Riley's stock price fell $9.02, or 22%, to close at $32.54 per share on the next trading day, November 6, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and the price of B. Riley's 6.00% Senior Notes due 2028 (""6% Senior Notes"") fell $1.77, or 9.01%, to close at $17.87 per 6% Senior Note on the next trading day, November 6, 2023.

Loading...Loading...

Then, on November 9, 2023, after the market closed, the Company revealed significant details concerning the FRG transaction and the years-long series of complex financial transactions between B. Riley, Kahn, and the Company's respective subsidiaries, which culminated in the August 21, 2023 transaction. Analyzing these complex transactions, The Friendly Bear reported that ""B Riley ended up funding 281MM of what was around a 560MM equity check. That's over 50% ownership. Yet they claim to have only 31% voting rights. It looks like B Riley engaged in some funny business to avoid consolidation and placed control of FRG in the hands of the star of 'Prophecy' - Brian Kahn.""

On this news, B. Riley's stock price fell $4.47, or 15%, to close at $25.60 per share on November 10, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and B. Riley's 6% Senior Note price fell $1.01, or 5.34%, to close at $17.92 per 6% Senior Note on November 10, 2023. B. Riley's stock price continued to fall $3.59, or 14%, over the next consecutive trading session to close at $22.01 per share on November 13, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume; and B. Riley's 6% Senior Note price fell $3.06, or 17.08%, over the next consecutive trading session to close at $14.86 per 6% Senior Note on November 13, 2023, on unusually heavy trading volume.

(""Innoviz"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: INVZ) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 24-cv-01971 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Innoviz securities between April 21, 2021 and February 28, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

Innoviz designs and manufactures solid-state light detection and ranging, or ""LiDAR"", sensors and develops perception software that purportedly enables the mass production of autonomous vehicles. The Company operates in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and North America.

Shortly after Innoviz began publicly trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in April 2021, the Company represented that it had entered into multiple contracts, partnerships, and/or collaborations with several noteworthy automotive original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") throughout the world. These relationships, the Company claimed, would purportedly ""uniquely position"" Innoviz to make autonomous driving a commercial reality, and could be ""leveraged to penetrate and partner with other OEMs customers and Tier-1 suppliers."" For example, Innoviz touted that the Company's ""intense sustained cooperation with BMW [. . .] provides [its] engineers and other R&D personnel with a valuable competitive edge"" and that ""[t]he compelling nature of [the Company's] approach and solution is demonstrated by [its] agreements with four Tier-1 suppliers, including Aptiv and Magna, both of which invested in [Innoviz], and Harman and Hirain, as well [Innoviz's] 2018 selection by BMW to supply [the Company's] automotive grade InnovizOne sensor for integration into new vehicle builds.""

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Innoviz had overstated the benefits that the Company was likely to derive from its purported contracts, partnerships, and/or collaborations with automotive companies; (ii) as a result, the Company was unlikely to achieve the level of profitability that Defendants had represented to investors; (iii) accordingly, Innoviz had overstated its business and/or financial prospects; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On March 1, 2023, during pre-market hours, Innoviz issued a press release announcing the Company's financial and operational results for its fiscal full year (""FY"") 2022. Among other items, Innoviz reported GAAP FY 2022 earnings per share of -$0.94, missing consensus estimates by $0.06, and revenue of $6.03 million, missing consensus estimates by $0.96 million. In addition, Innoviz guided for FY 2023 revenue to fall in the range of $12 million to $15 million, significantly below consensus estimates of $30 million. The Company's disappointing FY 2022 results came as a surprise to investors given that Innoviz had previously extolled the benefits it would derive from its various partnerships with purported ""Tier-1 companies."" Indeed, after a multi-year period of announcing partnerships with various automotive companies throughout the world, the press release reporting the Company' FY 2022 results said conspicuously little about these supposed collaborations, referencing only its partnerships with BMW and Volkswagen.

On this news, Innoviz's ordinary share price fell $0.71 per share, or 14.95%, to close at $4.04 per share on March 1, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

Local pubs, cinemas and community centres in the region have been allocated £3.3m in levelling up funding.

This included the century-old Abbeydale Picture House in Sheffield, which only announced its closure last month.

A project to purchase the building and carry out necessary repairs has received £300,000.

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the cash boost would ""re-establish it as a thriving, vibrant cultural focal point"".

Steve Rimmer, founder of Creative Arts Development Space (CADS), said it would make a ""huge difference"" and he was ""thankful and excited"" to be able to take the first step.

A 200-year-old cricket club in Huddersfield has also been awarded £300,000 to build a new clubhouse.

Lascelles Hall Cricket Club was the target of an arson attack in 2010, which destroyed their clubhouse and has forced them to operate out of a temporary one ever since.

The funding would help them to build a more sustainable clubhouse, now they have received planning permission.

Keighley Creative in Bradford, West Yorkshire, has been awarded £1.3m to ""secure its long-term future"" through the purchase and refurbishment of the upper floor of the building.

The space would be brought back into community use, with a space for artists' studios.

Jacob Young, Minister for Levelling Up, said: ""We know how much these vital community assets mean to people across the country.

""They are an important lifeline for people young and old, and they're the beating heart of our towns, cities and villages.

""That's why we're stepping in to protect them with a major rescue package.""

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

Islamic mutual funds, which invest public funds in Shariah-compliant securities, are grappling with a shortage of investment tools necessary for diversifying portfolios and securing their investments.

Market insiders said the blue-chip stocks in the capital market are quite small and it shrinks further when Shariah filters are applied.

Typically, Shariah mutual funds lean towards non-financials, with a view towards long-term capital accumulation. There is, therefore, a need for more quality initial public offerings (IPOs) for these types of businesses, they added.

According to a report by EBL Securities on Islamic mutual funds published on 21 March, investments in Shariah-compliant mutual funds are heavily reliant on the pharmaceutical sector. Many fund managers have concentrated public funds in a limited number of stocks due to a shortage of investment tools.

As a result, the country's Islamic mutual funds have only grown by 10% in the last five years, while globally, they have experienced a growth of over 300%.

At present, there are 14 open-end Islamic mutual funds and four closed-end Islamic mutual funds operating in Bangladesh. As of September 2023, the total Assets Under Management (AuM) of Islamic mutual funds stood at Tk771 crore. Out of this, the AuM of Islamic closed-end funds was Tk369 crore, while the open-end mutual funds during the same period was Tk402 crore.

In the open-end segment, ICB Asset Management Company leads the industry with total AuM of Tk70 crore which accounts for around 17.35% of the total Islamic open-end AuM.

In terms of closed-end segment, the market is dominated by Strategic Equity Management, with total AuM of Tk101 crore, around 27.55% of the total Islamic closed-end AuM.

The journey of Islamic mutual funds in Bangladesh started in 2010 with Islamic Finance and Investment Limited's ""IFIL Islamic Mutual Fund-1"". It was a closed-end mutual fund.

In the same year, Al-Arafah Islami Bank sponsored another closed-end Shariah Mutual fund, named ""AIBL 1st Islamic Mutual Fund."" Open-end Shariah mutual funds entered the fray in 2016 with Asian Tiger Capital Partners Investments Limited's ""ATC Shariah Unit Fund.""

In 1984, M Yaqub Mirza floated the idea of establishing the Amana Income Fund, the first US mutual fund managed according to Islamic principles.

As of 2021, there were 1,508 Islamic mutual funds globally with a total AuM of $194.51 billion.",tbsnews.net,news,The Business Standard,,0.09019607843137245,448913739,1,https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/02/24/mutual_funds_2.jpg,

Local pubs, cinemas and community centres in the region have been allocated £3.3m in levelling up funding.

This included the century-old Abbeydale Picture House in Sheffield, which only announced its closure last month.

A project to purchase the building and carry out necessary repairs has received £300,000.

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the cash boost would ""re-establish it as a thriving, vibrant cultural focal point"".

Steve Rimmer, founder of Creative Arts Development Space (CADS), said it would make a ""huge difference"" and he was ""thankful and excited"" to be able to take the first step.

A 200-year-old cricket club in Huddersfield has also been awarded £300,000 to build a new clubhouse.

Lascelles Hall Cricket Club was the target of an arson attack in 2010, which destroyed their clubhouse and has forced them to operate out of a temporary one ever since.

The funding would help them to build a more sustainable clubhouse, now they have received planning permission.

Keighley Creative in Bradford, West Yorkshire, has been awarded £1.3m to ""secure its long-term future"" through the purchase and refurbishment of the upper floor of the building.

The space would be brought back into community use, with a space for artists' studios.

Jacob Young, Minister for Levelling Up, said: ""We know how much these vital community assets mean to people across the country.

""They are an important lifeline for people young and old, and they're the beating heart of our towns, cities and villages.

""That's why we're stepping in to protect them with a major rescue package.""

NEW YORK, March 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Cassava Sciences, Inc. (""Cassava"" or the ""Company"") SAVA. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and docketed under 24 -cv- 00977, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Cassava securities between August 18, 2022 and October 12, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

If you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired Cassava securities during the Class Period, you have until April 2, 2024, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980.

Cassava is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company's lead therapeutic drug candidate is PTI-125 (or ""simufilam""), a small molecule drug for the proposed treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In March 2020, Cassava initiated a long-term, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of simufilam 100 mg twice daily for 12 or more months in patients with Alzheimer's disease and to assess exploratory efficacy endpoints, such as changes in cognition, and biomarkers.

Then, in August 2021, a Citizen Petition requested the United States Food & Drug Administration (""FDA"") to halt any phase 3 trials of simufilam due to concerns regarding data manipulation. Specifically, the Citizen Petition referenced ""grave concerns about the quality and integrity of the laboratory-based studies surrounding this drug candidate and supporting the claims for its efficacy.""

However, in response, Cassava denied the allegations in the Citizen Petition and instead touted the effectiveness of simufilam and the efficacy of the Company's research programs. Indeed, in a press release published shortly after the FDA received the Citizen Petition, Cassava stated that ""[t]he Company stands behind its science, its scientists and its scientific collaborators."" Thereafter, Cassava continued to maintain its defense of simufilam even as criticisms of simufilam were revealed from additional sources and academic journals such as Neurobiology of Aging and the Journal of Neuroscience issued ""expressions of concern"" regarding the efficacy of the drug.

On October 12, 2023, the peer-reviewed academic journal Science reported that Professor Hoau-Yan Wang (""Dr. Wang""), a City University of New York researcher associated with the research program for simufilam, had been investigated by university officials for possible data manipulation. Although the investigative committee did not have access to the raw data at issue and thus was unable to confirm that data manipulation had occurred, members made their conclusion based on ""long-standing and egregious misconduct in data management and record keeping by Dr. Wang"" and ""found evidence highly suggestive of deliberate scientific misconduct"" by Dr. Wang.

On this news, Cassava's stock price fell $2.68 per share, or 15.28%, to close at $14.86 per share on October 13, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company failed to maintain adequate and effective data management controls and procedures related to its drug research programs; (ii) as a result, the data published in support of simufilam were susceptible to manipulation to overstate the drug's effectiveness; (iii) accordingly, Cassava had misrepresented the efficacy of its research programs and the clinical and/or commercial prospects of simufilam; (iv) all of the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to subject the Company to significant financial and/or reputational harm; and (v) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

Williams shared a TikTok video where she discussed her investment business which she started long before her 'transition away from tennis'.

Quite a few of her investments have hit the headlines like her stake in the Miami Dolphins.

Williams formed an investment group with Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Mia Hamm, and Becky G in July 2022 to support the National Women's Soccer League (NSWL). The group of women, together with Williams' daughter Olympia, co-own Angel City FC, which became the NSWL's 11th franchised side headquartered in Los Angeles.

""Hey everyone, I thought it'd be really fun to kinda talk about things that I do now that I don't play professional tennis anymore. Kinda evolved from that. One thing that I have been doing, that I'm doing for years and years is investments,"" Serena Williams said in her recent TikTok video.

""So I invest in a lot of companies, early companies, so think early stage, where companies have just started. And, I've always done this, I've actually been investing for over 14 years.""

Williams has found herself getting more and more engaged with investments and is proud of her successes including investing in startup that would become a unicorns.

She said that investment was her plan B but it has proven more profutable than her tennis career.

""Just been an entrepreneur, while I was playing tennis, it's super important for me to make a plan B while I was doing my plan A. Sounds weird, like a plan B. But it was fun, it was really important for me to do that, she added. ""So, in my personal portfolio, I have invested in over 85 companies, maybe? Also, 14 are unicorn and a few decacorns.""

Serena Ventures was created in 2014 in Washington, D.C. by Williams and Alison Rapaport Stilman with the goal of assisting businesses ""whose perspectives and innovations level the playing field for women and people of colour.""

However, she only announced the company in a post to Instagram in April 2019. It is now headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, and is actively seeking early-stage, series A, B, C, and seed investments.

Serena Ventures manages a wide portfolio of 64 firms in consumer products and services, information technology, TMT, healthcare, e-commerce, and wellness.

According to the firm's website, 53% of these 64 firms are created by women, and 76% by entrepreneurs from historically underrepresented backgrounds.",tennis365.com,news,Tennis365.com,James Richardson,0.223529411764706,448913371,1,https://d2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/09/03073144/Serena-Williams-bows-out.jpg,eng-9420533

NEW YORK, March 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Amylyx"" or the ""Company"") AMLX and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States (""U.S."") District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 24-cv-00988, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Amylyx securities between November 11, 2022 and November 8, 2023, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

If you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired Amylyx securities during the Class Period, you have until April 9, 2024 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.

Amylyx is a commercial-stage biotechnology company that engages in the discovery and development of treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (""ALS""), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The Company's products include, among others, AMX0035 (commercially referred to as ""RELYVRIO"" in the U.S.), a dual UPR-Bax apoptosis inhibitor composed of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, for the treatment of ALS in adults in the U.S.

Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's September 2022 approval of RELYVRIO for the treatment of ALS in adults in the U.S., Defendants consistently touted the drug's commercial prospects and prescription rate.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had overstated RELYVRIO's commercial prospects; (ii) patients were discontinuing treatment with RELYVRIO after six months; (iii) the rate at which new patients were starting treatment with RELYVRIO was decreasing; (iv) accordingly, Defendants had also overstated RELYVRIO's prescription rate; (v) Defendants attempted to hide the foregoing negative trends from investors and the market by blocking analysts from viewing RELYVRIO's prescription data; and (vi) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On November 9, 2023, Amylyx issued a press release announcing its third quarter (""Q3"") 2023 financial results, including Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, missing consensus estimates by $0.12. That same day, on a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss these results, Company management revealed that, despite ""a [purported] steady cadence of new prescriptions written in"" Q3 for RELYVRIO, Amylyx's ""results were impacted by a number of factors"" including a ""slowdown in net adds"" for RELYVRIO in Q3, which ""was primarily driven by increased discontinuations for a variety of reasons"", with only ""60% of people taking RELYVRIO remain[ing] on therapy six months after initiation in the U.S.""

Also on November 9, 2023, Investor's Business Daily published an article addressing the Company's disappointing financial results (the ""IBD Article""). The IBD Article cited an Evercore ISI analyst, who questioned Amylyx's assertion that the number of new patients starting treatment with RELYVRIO was ""steady"", noting that his math suggested otherwise and that Amylyx had blocked analysts from viewing RELYVRIO's prescription data in the summer of 2023. The analyst also stated that, ""[k]nowing that [Amylyx's] stock had underperformed in 2023 already, management could have communicated the discontinuations dynamic much earlier,"" and that the ""[s]tock move today in a bad biotech tape and fund performance doesn't help investor confidence among folks that have held onto the stock.""

Following these disclosures and the publication of the IBD Article, Amylyx's stock price fell $5.74 per share, or 31.89%, to close at $12.26 per share on November 9, 2023.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

And with it, the impacts of closing schools in that first year continue to be tabulated.

Among the biggest costs has been learning loss. Students have begun to recover some of the pandemic losses from long school closures but have a long way to go.

The good news, post-COVID, is that school immunizations are quite high in Santa Cruz County, with many schools reporting levels of 95% or even higher.

Other school data, provided by the California Department of Education, reveals more disturbing trends, affecting enrollment in public schools.

According to data from the state Department of Education, there were 28 private schools counted in Santa Cruz County with enrollment of 3,904 in 2022-23, up slightly from 3,854 in 2021-22 but way down from a count of 6,933 from pre-COVID 2019-20 (if that figure is correct, since it seems far out of whack).

There are 39,700 students enrolled in Santa Cruz County public schools this year, according to the county Office of Education, with nearly a quarter of these classified as English learners.

The state Education Department listed 2022-23 county enrollment at 38,025. The state site shows 40,225 students were enrolled in 2020-21, meaning there were roughly 2,200 fewer students over a two-year period.

Chronic absenteeism (defined as a pupil absent on 10% or more of the school days in the school year), however, rose from 11.5% of all enrolled students in 2020-21 to an alarming 26.5% two years later.

Academic achievement results as compiled by the state show, overall, county students have regained pre-COVID levels. That said, these results are not impressive. For 2022-23, nearly 35% did not reach English language arts/literacy achievement levels. For math, nearly 45% failed to reach this minimum level.

And, as we wrote in this space last week about the budget shocks hitting the Live Oak School District, dropping enrollment and chronic absenteeism are causing many school district budgets to shrink, further eroding the level of teaching and support needed to get kids back on track.

Districts are almost totally dependent on how much money the state budget allocates each year under Proposition 98, a formula adopted by voters in 1988. The number that is agreed upon by politicians goes to school districts, mostly derived from average daily attendance.

California is one of a handful of states using attendance to determine funding. Now with an aging population, and younger families forced by the high cost of living to leave the state, enrollment is dropping, and student absences are increasing.

The statewide figures mirror Santa Cruz County with enrollment forecast to further decline across the state over the coming decade, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California. Enrollment statewide topped out at about 6.3 million students at the turn of the century and is forecast by the state Department of Finance to drop below 5.2 million by 2032.

The sharp increase in chronic absenteeism, starting with kindergarten, is alarming because, as the PPIC reported ""absenteeism tends to have a snowball effect: a student is more likely to be chronically absent in later grades if they are chronically absent in earlier ones.""

During the pandemic, school finances were bolstered by billions of dollars in federal relief funds adding to the distress districts are beginning to feel as the full impact of enrollment declines and absenteeism hits and the federal funding ends.

For Live Oak, this meant cutting staff including teachers and aides while the superintendent was essentially forced to resign. For other districts, the prospect of school closures will be on the table, despite opposition from parents and school staffs.

Live Oak, and other districts in similar straits, could be canaries in the coal mine. Legislators and the governor need to focus their attention on what is happening and re-examine the state's school funding formula.",santacruzsentinel.com,news,Santa Cruz Sentinel,Editorial Board,-0.1137254901960785,448913344,1,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SCS-placeholder.jpg,eng-9420937

US President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defence, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defence spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24 per cent increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programmes and new child care centres for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow on Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""",khaleejtimes.com,news,Khaleej times,Associated Press,0.03529411764705892,448913050,1,https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=bb36414c-43e4-5563-b641-9c956ff5a271&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84131&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675,eng-9411206

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The House passed the bills on Friday.

The package, approved on a Senate vote of 74-24, funds the federal government until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

Biden applauded the bipartisan package, but said Congress had more work to do on national security and border legislation.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a statement released by the White House. ""That's good news for the American people.""

""It has been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Friday night before the vote. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

Minutes after the clock struck midnight -- the deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown -- the White House weighed in.

""[The Office of Management and Budget] has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement given to the press pool. ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

The funding package includes defense, homeland security, financial services and general government, labor-HHS, the legislative branch, and state-foreign operations. The bills needed two-thirds support in the House and was approved on a vote of 286-134.

The Friday House vote could have consequences for Speaker Mike Johnson. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to remove him as Speaker.

There were warning signs Thursday night that the vote may be tighter than GOP leadership expected.

Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., who chairs the Labor-HHS subcommittee, said he'd be voting against the package because of earmarks senators on both sides of the aisle inserted into the bill.

""This is not the bill that my subcommittee produced and supported. The Senate has taken liberties with their Congressionally Directed Spending requests that would never stand in the House,"" he said in a statement.

Republican members also expressed disappointment that the package didn't go further on strengthening the Southern border and criticized the narrow timeframe between the 1000+ page text'srelease early Thursday morning and the Friday vote.

But Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on defense, urged his colleagues to vote for the package.

""Every member must understand the impact of not passing this package. The only other option will be a full year continuing resolution, which will devastate our national security and put our country at risk,"" he said ahead of the House vote. ""A no vote is a vote for China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Hamas.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, and education, said the package represents a compromise.

""This legislation does not have everything either side may have wanted,"" she said. ""But I am satisfied that many of the extreme cuts and the policies proposed by House Republicans were rejected.""

She noted her work with other House and Senate Appropriators -- Rep. Kay Granger of Texas and Sens. Collins of Maine and Murray of Washington ""marks the first time negotiations on government funding have been led on all four corners by women.""

The package has wins for both Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans are touting an increase in the number of ICE detention beds and border agents and cutting funding to NGOs. They're also trumpeting a provision that prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from banning gas stoves and another that prevents diplomatic facilities from flying flags that aren't official U.S. flags.

Democrats are praising a $1 billion increase for childcare and early learning programs, including $12 billion for the Head Start program.

Another provision getting a lot of attention is the measure that halts funding for UNWRA, the United Nations Agency that provides aid to Palestinians, until March of 2025. This comes after Israel alleged that a dozen UNWRA staffers took part in Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.

Under House rules, it only takes one lawmaker to bring up a vote to oust the speaker. Greene's motion to remove Johnson, months after House Republicans ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is not privileged, meaning it's unclear if or when it will be brought to the floor for a vote.

Johnson presides over a razor thin, one-vote majority, with Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck resigning from the House on Friday and Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher announcing Friday he's resigning effective April 19.

Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., told reporters ahead of the vote that he blames Johnson for bringing the package to the floor for a vote in the first place. He said he didn't want to talk about personnel issues within GOP leadership, but said he ""can't defend the speaker.""

That´s good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country´s rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia´s invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement - the toughest and fairest reforms in decades - to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It´s time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That´s about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer´s research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ...

The deaths have been attributed to people not availing themselves for screening; diagnosis capacity gap among health workers; inadequate screening and diagnostic equipment; late introduction of preventive treatment and stigma.

Coupled with the above, funding to carry out TB control programme is currently limited, with virtually no state commitment.

The disease is transmitted when an infected person with symptoms-active TB- coughs, sings, sneezes, shouts or talks, which releases the TB bacteria into the atmosphere, which is in turn inhaled by people around.

An asymptomatic person living with the condition, known as latent TB, can not transmit but such a person could develop the active TB if his/her immune system gets compromised or breaks down due to other health conditions and poor diet.

The mode of transmission makes everyone vulnerable, a situation which requires that everybody should help to find all persons yet to be diagnosed of TB but living with the condition.

The Manager of the National Tuberculosis Programme, Dr Yaw Adusi-Poku, said everyone was vulnerable to the highly contagious airborne disease, and that all hands must be on deck to put TB under control.

He said people in poorly ventilated or air-conditioned spaces were more vulnerable, and mentioned other risk factors to include people with compromised immune systems such as people living with diabetes, and HIV infection.

He said people who also indulged in substance abuse and people with low body weight were also vulnerable to active TB.

Addressing a section of the media at a training programme on TB advocacy in Accra, Dr Adusi-Poku said TB control in the country was heavily dependent on donor funding, particularly on the global fund, a situation he described as worrying and unsustainable.

The training was organised by the Ghana National TB Voice Network (GNTBVN), in partnership with the National TB Control Programme and the Global Fund.

It has been established that the government does not honour its Global Fund Grant Cycle 7 (GC7) co-financing obligation, and has not made any financial commitment to the fight against TB for the next three years as required by the United Nations (UN).

Dr Adusi-Poku said more public and private investments into screening, advocacy and treatment were required to deal with the national TB burden and accelerated interventions.

He said the mode of transmission made everyone vulnerable.

Commemoration

On March 24 every year, the international community commemorates World Tuberculosis (TB) Day to raise awareness of the importance of screening and treatment of what has been described as one of the world's deadliest diseases.

World TB Day is an opportunity to renew commitment, inspire and take action to end TB.

This year's commemoration, which happens tomorrow is on the theme ""Yes! We can end TB"".

March 24 is the anniversary of the day in 1882 when the bacterium causing TB was discovered.

Lack of logistics, equipment

Dr Adusi-Poku said the country recorded 19,000 new cases of TB in 2023, with the number showing an increase over the 16,500 cases recorded in 2022.

However, he said, case detection was far below the estimated 44,000 TB cases projected to be detected annually.

He said between 2014 and 2019, an average of 15,000 and below cases were picked annually, indicating that more people with the condition had not been diagnosed and were not on treatment, posing huge risk to the entire population.

He said in the past, the country did not have modern equipment to ensure that results were obtained in a matter of hours, but expressed delight that a new generation of TB screening equipment, the Gene-Xperts, had been introduced.

He lamented, however, that out of the 261 districts, only 171 had the Gene-Xperts.

""We have 261 districts, and we have 171 Gene-Xperts, so we need to expand, make it accessible so that the mother or care giver wouldn't travel for long for the test,"" he said.

He said the districts without the Gene-Xperts did sample transportation to the teaching hospitals for diagnosis, and that it took two weeks to get the results instead of just about 16 hours.

Dr Adusi-Poku said the national TB programme had over the years been saddled with inadequate cartridges required to screen TB using the Gene-Xperts.

He said in 2023, more new TB cases were picked up because the National TB Programme had a good number of the cartridges.

""Throughout 2023, there were no shortages of cartridges. We got cartridges from the COVID fund, through proposals that we wrote.

He said currently, there were cartridges available, which were a rollover from 2023 but he could not guarantee if they would be enough for 2024 through to 2025 and 2026 unless the government came in to support.

Appeal

Dr Adusi-Poku and the other stakeholders, such as the Stop TB... and the Global Fund, appealed to the government and private entities to invest in equipment, logistics, advocacy and capacity building for health workers to enhance cases detection and treatment.

He also appealed to Parliament to support the National TB Programme by amending the procurement laws to allow them to purchase cartridges and first-line medicines and resources.

He also called on the media to continue and heighten advocacy on TB to demystify the health condition and eradicate the stigma associated with the condition, especially because it was acquired through breathing.

He said TB care was a basic human right just like every other healthcare need and, therefore, in the spirit of Universal Health Coverage and leaving no one behind, deliberate efforts were needed by all stakeholders, particularly the government, to ensure that no case was missed and no found case was lost.",ghanamma.com,news,GHANA MMA,,-0.2,448912735,1,https://www.ghanamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dr-Yaw-Adusi-Poku-Manager-of-the-National-Tuberculosis-Programme.png,eng-9419170

Lantronix is a global industrial and enterprise internet of things (""IoT"") provider of solutions that purportedly target high growth applications in specific verticals such as smart grids, intelligent transportation, smart cities, and artificial intelligence data centers. The Company organizes its products and solutions into three product lines: (i) Embedded IoT Solutions, (ii) IoT System Solutions, and (iii) Software & Services. The Company's sales channels are comprised of distributors, resellers, and direct sales to larger original equipment manufacturers and end users, as well as through its ecommerce site.

In May 2023, Lantronix forecasted that it would achieve revenue in a range of $175 million to $185 million, as well as non-GAAP earnings-per-share (""EPS"") in a range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share, for its fiscal year 2024 results. Defendants repeatedly assured investors and analysts throughout the Class Period that this guidance for fiscal year 2024 remained unchanged, despite knowing that Lantronix's customers were experiencing elevated levels of inventory for IoT products, and that embedded IOT revenues expected from a customer design win were pushed out to the next fiscal year.

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Lantronix overstated demand and/or its visibility into demand for its IoT products; (ii) Lantronix's customers were reducing elevated levels of inventory of IoT products, thereby causing a general slowdown in the Company's business; (iii) certain of Lantronix's embedded IOT revenues expected from a customer design win were delayed to the next fiscal year; (iv) as a result of all the foregoing, Lantronix anticipated lower sales for its embedded IOT solutions for fiscal year 2024; (v) accordingly, Lantronix was unlikely to meet its own previously issued guidance for fiscal year 2024; and (vi) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

On February 8, 2024, Lantronix issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024. Therein, the Company negatively revised its fiscal year 2024 guidance, advising that ""[f]or fiscal year 2024, the company [now] expects revenue in a range of $155 million to $165 million"" -- versus the previously provided range of $175 million to $185 million -- ""and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share"" -- versus the previously provided range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. On a call with investors and analysts to discuss these results, Company management revealed that ""[t]he change in our annual guidance is primarily due to lower expected sales for our embedded IOT solutions as a result of two factors"", namely, ""[a] general slowdown in our broad-based channel business as customers work through their inventories, and an embedded compute design win in video applications that was slated for revenue in the second half of fiscal 2024 that pushed into fiscal 2025.""

Following these disclosures, Lantronix's stock price fell $1.89 per share, or 32.53%, to close at $3.92 per share on February 9, 2024.

NEW YORK, March 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (""iRobot"" or the ""Company"") IRBT and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and docketed under 24-cv-02138, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between August 5, 2022 and January 26, 2024, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants' violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials.

iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (""RVC"") products sold under the ""Roomba"" brand name.

In August 2022, iRobot and Amazon.com, Inc. (""Amazon""), which sells iRobot's RVCs on its online marketplace, announced their entry into a definitive merger agreement (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which Amazon would ""acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including iRobot's net debt"" (the ""Merger"").

The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Merger would place Amazon in a sufficiently dominant position in the market for RVCs that U.S. and European antitrust regulators were unlikely to approve the Merger; (ii) iRobot had conducted inadequate due diligence into the Merger and/or ignored significant risks weighing against the likelihood of regulatory approval; (iii) as a result of all the foregoing, iRobot overstated the likelihood for successfully completing the Merger; and (iv) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On June 22, 2023, news outlets reported that Europe's antitrust regulator, the European Commission (""EC""), was planning to launch a full-scale investigation into the Merger.

On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $4.12 per share, or 8.32%, to close at $45.41 per share on June 22, 2023.

On November 27, 2023, the EC announced that it ""has informed Amazon of its preliminary view that its proposed acquisition of iRobot may restrict competition in the market for [RVCs]."" In particular, the EC advised that, ""[a]s a result of [its] in-depth investigation, the [EC] is concerned that Amazon may restrict competition in the European Economic Area ('EEA')-wide and/or national markets for RVCs, by hampering rival RVC suppliers' ability to effectively compete"" (emphasis in original).

On January 10, 2024, news outlets reported that Amazon did not offer concessions to the EC to appease the regulator's concerns about the Merger. For example, POLITICO reported that day that ""[t]he European Union's webpage on the deal shows that the companies didn't make an offer by the end of the day on Wednesday, its last chance to tackle European Union objections that Amazon could hamper rival vacuum cleaners' sales on Amazon's online marketplace.""

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new childcare centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The financial burden of the KP-RIISP, estimated at a total of 110 billion rupees, will be partially borne through a loan exceeding 80 billion rupees from the World Bank, with the remainder funded by the provincial government. The project aims to enhance infrastructure and administrative facilities across tribal districts, with separate units established to ensure efficient monitoring.

A substantial portion of the allocated funds, totaling 2.39 billion rupees, has been earmarked for bureaucratic incentives, procurement of vehicles, and the establishment of upscale offices. Additionally, 240 million rupees have been set aside for staff salaries and project management, including the monthly wage of the project director amounting to three million rupees.

Smart Engines says it has developed facial recognition that avoids regulatory hurdles associated with biometrics, while Login.gov has taken a major step towards meeting the required security standard by contracting eight remote identity proofing providers, and the EU's cybersecurity agency wants to raise awareness of the evolving threat landscape. Beyond identity proofing, a Castles Technology executive considers the place of biometrics cards and facial recognition in future retail payments, while cards made with sensors and software from Thales, Fingerprint Cards and Idex roll out, and Clearview gets a place on a key defense procurement listing.

Smart Engines has developed a neural network that performs ""end-to-end"" comparisons similar to the way humans do to make facial recognition matches, but without using biometric data, the company says. The major advantage this would provide is in compliance to data privacy regulations, and potentially Europe's AI Act. The new software is also designed to work offline.

The U.S. General Services Administration his signed agreements to choose amongst Experian, Idemia I&S, Carahsoft, LexisNexis, Aderas, Celerity, Diamond Capture Associates and TransUnion for identity proofing on Login.gov over the next 10 years. The total value of the contracts, which should pave the way for the government services portal to meet the IAL2 standard with face biometrics, is up to $194.5 million.

Clearview has been approved for the Tradewinds Solutions Marketplace, and its facial recognition algorithm and database placed in a technology market for U.S. DoD contracts. The marketplace is operated by the CDAO, and offers digital tools meeting FAR and DFARS requirements. The company has also joined the MissionLink national security technology program.

A report from ENISA outlines good practices for remote identity proofing to help guide the use and development of countermeasures for rapidly evolving threats. Biometric presentation and injection attacks, ID fraud and deepfakes are explored, and the agency calls for flexible but cohesive policy.

Worldcoin is in compliance with all of the relevant regulations around the world, according to a company blog post. Some key figures seem to disagree. Kenya's Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has told the National Assembly that the U.S. government has been encouraging the Kenyan government to lift the company's suspension in the country, Business Daily reports.

India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been received with protests in Assam for discriminating against Muslims, but could lead to multiple million people becoming able to obtain the national digital ID, Aadhaar. Their biometrics were blocked from Aadhaar registration after a civil registration exercise cast doubt on their citizenship status, causing hardship for many.

Turkey appears to be embracing biometric payment cards, with a pair from Mastercard reaching the market. Garanti BBVA will offer cards made with Thales and Fingerprint Cards technology (their eleventh globally), while DenizBank is introducing cards made with Idex Biometrics' Pay solution.

Biometric payments are proliferating through smartphones, cards and payment terminals, Castles Technology Group CCO and EMEA CEO Jean-Philippe Niedergang writes in a Biometric Update guest post, but cost, security and data storage remain barriers. Niedergang analyzes the factors behind whether biometrics will reach mainstream payments in the form of cards, or modalities like vein or facial recognition at the POS.

The ICO is getting involved after the discovery of thousands of errors in UK immigration records, which left people unable to unable to meet right to work, housing and medical services requirements. Many millions of pounds have been spent on the UK's digital systems for immigration control, on top of separate funding for the IABS, but ministers are left denying systemic problems.

A dodgy company billing itself as an identity verification provider appears to have been selling Nigerian people's breached personal information. The records, including digital ID numbers, were selling for 200 naira (US$0.13) a person. Both data protection and national identity authorities are investigating.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new childcare centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new childcare centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republican senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new childcare centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Updated 1:25 PM EDT, March 23, 2024

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight. But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden signed the funding bills package into law Saturday, the White House said, averting a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include.""

Biden once again called on Congress to pass a national security supplemental bill to provide U.S. assistance to Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, and funding for border security and reforms to border policy.

""Congress's work isn't finished,"" Biden said, later adding, ""It's time to get this done.""

After a day of total procedural hijinks, the Senate passed the government funding bills in the early morning hours of Saturday, having struck an eleventh-hour amendment agreement to allow expedited passage of the bill.

The $1.2 trillion government funding bill was sent to Biden's desk as the late night drama on Capitol Hill capped a turbulent process featuring a year of haggling, six months of stopgaps and intense partisan clashes over money and policy.

Majority Leader Schumer announced the agreement on the floor early Saturday morning.

""It's been a very long and difficult day but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government. It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal it wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the American people that we have reached an agreement to fund the government tonight.""

The White House said shortly after midnight that the Office of Management and Budget ceased its shutdown preparations, citing ""a high degree of confidence"" that Congress will ""imminently pass"" funding bills to keep the government open.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said after the Senate passed the bill.

The bills passed in a House 286-134 vote earlier Friday afternoon, despite pushback from far-right members of the Republican caucus. More Democrats backed the bill than Republicans as more than 100 GOP lawmakers voted against it.

The $1.2 trillion package -- considered a major bipartisan effort in the highly divided House -- provides funding for six bills including Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor and Health and Human Services and Education, Legislative Branch and State and Foreign Operations.

If the package is passed by both chambers, the government will be funded through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. It will also put an end to the continuing resolution cycle that has led to Congress nearly shutting the government down, at least partially, five times since October.

The government funding package was introduced in the House under suspension of the rules, which required a two-thirds majority vote for passage. That meant, yet again, House Speaker Mike Johnson needed to rely on Democrats to get the bills across the finish line -- a move that landed his predecessor Kevin McCarthy in hot water and led to his ouster as speaker last year.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., took to the floor during an hour of debate to urge lawmakers to vote yes.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Borroe Finance ($ROE) has been on a roll since launching its public presale, taking on established altcoins in the market, including XRP and Tron (TRX). Despite the recent collaboration between Tron (TRX) DAO and IntoTheBlock and the breakout prediction of XRP, Borroe Finance ($ROE) stands poised to lead the next investment wave.

The crypto market is entering a new wave of digital asset investment, with new DeFi projects such as Borroe Finance ($ROE) leading the charge. Positioned among the top ICO coins, Borroe Finance ($ROE) offers an opportunity to cop massive returns on investment. This potential puts it up against established players like XRP and TRX.

Since its debut, Borroe Finance ($ROE) has been a sensation, gaining the attention of DeFi players and Web3 users. DeFi players interact with the platform's dApps, contributing to its liquidity pool through staking. As for Web3 users, Borroe Finance is a funding platform that helps to raise funds through future earnings sales.

Borroe Finance is in stage 5 of its presale, selling at $0.020, representing an anticipated 5.2% increase in value from the last stage. However, on a broader scale, Borroe Finance ($ROE) investors can multiply their capital, thanks to the 25% impending surge to $0.025 before $ROE's DEX listing.

Captain Faibik, a notable figure in the crypto sector, has brought attention to a critical play on the XRP chart, which could determine its short-term trajectory. His analytical presentation has stirred anticipation in the XRP market, with market players ready to take advantage of his projection. In particular, Faibik stated in an X post on March 18 that XRP is on the brink of a blasting breakout from a symmetrical triangle on the weekly timeframe chart.

For the uninitiated, a symmetrical triangle represents a period of lower highs and higher lows, in which the price consolidates till its eventual explosive upside breakout. Essentially, it is a bullish pattern. Hence, Faibik suggests that XRP is drawing close to a breakout period that could transcend the price to $2.50.

In the meantime, XRP is down 15.6% from $0.72 on March 12 to $0.61 on March 18. Although an upturn is out of view, reaching the $2.50 level would necessitate an ambitious 309.8% increase in its current price. Considering that XRP's current outlook could be an opportunity for investors to find an entry, it would be a good crypto to buy before Faibik's projection plays out.

Tron DAO has initiated a strategic move involving the integration of IntoTheBlock into its market intelligence retinue. The incorporation of IntoTheBlock into Tron Dao is aimed at availing advanced indicators to TRX users. IntoTheBlock revealed the collaboration in a notice on its official website on March 14.

Tron (TRX) is regarded as a reliable and efficient layer-1 blockchain with a large user base. It hosts over 210 million wallets, processes 4.5 million daily transactions involving stablecoins, supports countless dApps, and boasts a $51 billion stablecoin market capitalization, amounting to 37% of the stablecoin market valuation.

Considering the size of the Tron blockchain and TRX's usage, adopting new indicators is, to a large extent, imperative.

Despite the importance of the recent association with the intelligence agent, TRX experienced a 7.5% price drop from $0.13 to $0.12 between March 12 and 18. Given its current trajectory, TRX is primed for further declines, which could lead to a price as low as $0.11 in the coming days. This projection implies a possible 6.5% decrease in the cost of TRX.",coinpedia.org,news,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,Pr Manager,0.2941176470588236,448911221,1,http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/02105955/ripple-xrp.webp,eng-9415256

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed Congress' $1.2 trillion spending package, finalizing the remaining batch of bills in a long-awaited budget to keep the government funded until Oct. 1.

Almost halfway into the fiscal year, the president's signature ends a months-long saga of Congress struggling to secure a permanent budget resolution and instead passing stopgap measures, nearly averting government shutdowns.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" Biden said in a Saturday statement. ""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted.""

The weekend budget deal slid in just under the wire before the Friday midnight funding deadline, as has been typical this fiscal year with eleventh-hour disagreements derailing near-complete deals.

The Senate passed the budget in a 74-24 vote at roughly 2 a.m. ET Saturday morning, technically two hours after the deadline due to last-minute disagreements. However, the White House said that it would not begin official shutdown operations since a deal had ultimately been secured and only procedural actions remained.

The House passed its own vote Friday morning after a week of scrambling to reconcile a lingering sticking point: funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which the White House took issue with last weekend. The White House's qualms delayed the negotiation process further, just as lawmakers were preparing to release the legislative text of the budget proposal.

This trillion-dollar tranche of six appropriation bills will fund agencies related to defense, financial services, homeland security, health and human services and more. Congress approved $459 billion for the first six appropriations bills earlier in March, which related to agencies that were less partisan and easier to negotiate.

With the government finally funded for the rest of the fiscal year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has cleared his plate of at least one looming issue.

But in so doing, he may have created another.

Hours before the House passed the spending package Friday morning, hardline House Republicans held a press conference to lambast the bill. Moments after the House narrowly passed the bill, far-right Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Johnson.

If ousting a House speaker for budget disagreements feels like a familiar story, that's because it is.

In October, after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown, the House voted to remove him, making him the first Speaker in history to be removed from that position.

Biden signing the bill into law means the government is now funded through the end of fiscal 2024. Congress and the White House will have just over six months to agree to funding for the next fiscal year.

""The bipartisan funding bill I just signed keeps the government open, invests in the American people, and strengthens our economy and national security,"" a White House statement read. ""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted. But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border that my Administration successfully fought to include. That's good news for the American people.

""But I want to be clear: Congress's work isn't finished. The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

The bill Biden signed on Saturday funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, State, Education, and the legislative branch. It was passed by the House of Representatives, 286-134, on Friday and by the Senate, 74-24, just after 2 a.m. EDT on Saturday.

While the funding was signed into law hours after the partial shutdown deadline of midnight Saturday, the White House confirmed shortly after the deadline that the affected agencies would not be shut down due to the short lapse in funding.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday. Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said in a statement early Saturday, per the press pool.

The spending bill signed into law on Saturday ends a tumultuous appropriations process for fiscal 2024, which was dominated by disorder and several interim stopgaps.

Ahead of the original deadline of midnight Oct. 1, 2023, the House and Senate were able to pass a stopgap to fund the government an additional 45 days, but then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) reliance on Democratic support to avert a shutdown prompted anger by some in the GOP conference. McCarthy was ousted from the speakership days later, after an effort led by eight Republicans and all Democrats in the chamber.

Johnson has been trying to appease the hardline Republican wing of the House, called the Freedom Caucus, to avoid meeting a similar fate.",nbcnewyork.com,news,NBC New York,,0.08235294117647052,448911197,1,https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/02/107379046-1709054499883-gettyimages-2036072119-1111_10.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

The race is on for Congress to pass the final spending package for the current budget year and push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. With spending set to expire for several key federal agencies at midnight Friday, the House and Senate are expected to take up a $1.2 trillion measure that combines six annual spending bills into one package.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But it rejects extreme cuts from House Republicans and expands access to child care, invests in cancer research, funds mental health and substance use care, advances American leadership abroad, and provides resources to secure the border. ... That's good news for the American people.""

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the Democratic president would sign it Saturday.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

Biden, in his statement, again pressed Congress to pass additional aid.

""The House must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental to advance our national security interests. And Congress must pass the bipartisan border security agreement -- the toughest and fairest reforms in decades -- to ensure we have the policies and funding needed to secure the border. It's time to get this done.""

A bipartisan border package collapsed last month when Republicans senators scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a press release on Thursday that Robert Ross Reinhart and Clarissa Rodriguez will spend time in prison due to the string of schemes they carried out from 2007 through 2013.

According to Ryan, Reinhart, a native of Wilmington, and Rodriguez, of Arlington, ""presented themselves as financially savvy, sophisticated, experienced and very successful people"" able to provide investment advice and assistance to others on various projects. The projects included plans to develop property and to promote and market inventions. Rodriguez and Reinhart ""failed to deliver, and instead left the victims bereft of their assets,"" Ryan said.

Some of the scams included:

* Charging two investors $55,000 for marketing advice and product research for two separate products that were never delivered.

* Convincing a woman to drain the bank accounts she shared with her husband and held for her 13-year-old daughter so Reinhart could invest the cash. Reinhart convinced the victim to obtain more cash for him to invest by refinancing her paid-off automobile. The money was never actually invested. Reinhart and Rodriguez additionally stole the woman's wedding jewelry under the guise of having it appraised and safeguarded. Reinhart then pawned the jewelry for $125.

* Reinhart solicited donations to support a bogus organization, titled ""Missing Persons Bureau, Special Investigations Unit,"" alleged to have been doing business in Washington, D.C. The unit would supposedly attempt to solve the 1977 disappearance of a 14-year-old girl from Townsend, Deborah Ann Quimby. During the scheme, Reinhart solicited a contribution from the mother of the missing girl and attempted to convince the town to pay over $11,000 in phone expenses for his fake investigation.

Ryan's office stated that in October 2013, a branch manager of Citizens Bank in Wilmington contacted police to report his belief that a customer was the victim of a scam being carried out by Reinhart. Reinhart had been in the bank seeking to ensure a deposit made by an ""investor"" into an account of a sham corporation he created could be wired to another account he controlled.

The Wilmington Police determined the transaction was suspicious, and ended up arresting an individual Reinhart had sent to the bank to withdraw the money. According to prosecutors, Reinhart then went into hiding in New Hampshire.

An investigation, led by the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, with assistance from the FBI's New England Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, and police in Wilmington and Chelmsford -- where other investors were conned -- led to the arrest of Reinhart and Rodriguez. They were charged with multiple counts of larceny in Woburn District Court.

The investigation continued and in late 2014, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted the pair for those charges and related financial crimes.

""For years, they preyed on victims who trusted them and believed their businesses to be legitimate,"" Ryan said in Thursday's release. ""Tragically, as we see in many scam cases like this one, the victims were left having suffered highly personal losses including inheritance, an engagement ring and even theft of money from a bank account belonging to a 13-year-old girl.""

Reinhart, who was 53 when he was indicted in 2014, was convicted by a Middlesex Superior Court jury of 11 counts of larceny over $250, two counts of attempted larceny over $250, and one count of larceny under $250. He was also deemed a common and notorious thief and sentenced to eight to 10 years in prison, followed by three years of probation. Reinhart was additionally ordered to repay his victims $169,000 in restitution. His sentences will run consecutively with a one- to two-year prison sentence he was already serving for attempting to pay a witness $500 to influence his testimony.

Rodriguez, who was 48 at the time of her 2014 indictment, was convicted of five counts of larceny over $250. She was also deemed a common and notorious thief and was sentenced to four to five years in state prison.",sentinelandenterprise.com,news,Sentinel and Enterprise,Aaron Curtis,-0.01960784313725494,448910989,1,https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LOW-L-FRAUD-032224.jpg?w=640,

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

""This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,"" Biden said in a statement.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in sign of the conservative frustration, initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

Mike Dunleavy's veto of a $200 million education bill.

Many rural districts say they now face developing budgets for the coming year while experiencing spikes in operating expenses, record staff vacancies and mounting deferred maintenance costs.

The education bill -- Senate Bill 140, which included the largest boost to public school funding in state history -- could have helped rural districts avoid painful choices they are now considering for next year, administrators said -- including eliminating sports teams, teacher and staff positions and student nutrition programs.

In Northwest Alaska, this could mean losing a beloved activity: basketball. The Northwest Arctic Borough School District is considering saving over $1.7 million by cutting sports and other activities, one of their many ideas for balancing the budget deficit, according to district superintendent Terri Walker.

In Sleetmute, a village in Western Alaska along the upper Kuskokwim River, the lack of funding means putting off replacing the community's partially condemned school with a roof in imminent danger of collapsing, according to district superintendent Madeline Aguillard. Students are still attending in a portion of the school building that's safe because they have nowhere else to go, said Aguillard.

Senate Bill 140 initially passed in both chambers of the Legislature with broad bipartisan support. It included a $680 increase to the Base Student Allocation -- an amount that many school administrators said was just half of the amount needed to address their operating needs and keep pace with inflation.

[Alaska lawmakers see no clear path to a new school funding bill]

The governor said he vetoed the bill because it did not include some of his priorities, including teacher bonuses and provisions for charter schools. The veto override failed as many school districts around the state were developing their budgets for the coming school year.

In a statement, a Dunleavy spokesperson said there's still time to pass an education bill this year, and that the governor ""has stated repeatedly that he supports increasing funding for education, especially given inflationary pressures. At the same time, funding should be targeted to where it will have the greatest impact.""

A number of rural districts reached for this story said that without the promise of additional money, they will struggle to cover even basic operating costs. Many of them rely solely on state funding to support their schools.

Most school districts around the state have reported increases in operating costs and growing budget deficits over the last several years. In rural Alaska, the cost of living is already astronomical -- and growing.

In the Northwest Arctic, expenses for essentials such as heating, electricity, shipping and food have surged by 28% since 2017, the last time when Alaska's public schools received a significant funding boost, said Walker with the region's schools.

""Because of subsistence and our culture and background, we're resilient and able to continue living here, but it's so hard with the prices. They are 60% higher than Anchorage, you know,"" said Margaret Hansen, president of the Northwest Arctic Borough School District Board of Education. ""The freight costs are so, so high.""

In the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the Yupiit school district is also facing rising costs of utilities -- including water, sewer and electricity, according to district superintendent Scott Ballard.

""We're paralyzed by the lack of systematic funding,"" he said. ""It costs 50% more now than it did five years ago just to keep the lights on, just to keep up with the cost of health care.""

Ballard said a BSA increase of $680 ""wouldn't even cover our deficit for next year."" Amid continued uncertainty in the Legislature, Ballard said the district was faced with planning for no additional funding.

""We can't make plans. We can't hire teachers. We can't offer contracts for vacant positions. We can't order essential equipment that we need for next year that has to come by barge,"" he said.

The Kuspuk school district experienced ""an incredible hike"" in electricity costs last year, Aguillard, the district superintendent, said.

To save money on heating, the district considered switching to wood-burning stoves -- ""but that depends on a huge amount of manpower,"" Aguillard said. ""And frankly, we don't have that.""

[After education bill veto override fails, major cuts to Anchorage schools back on table]

Petersburg School District administrators are not planning on any funding increases this year either, district superintendent Erica Kludt-Painter said, especially after the governor vetoed half of a one-time public education funding boost last June.

""At this point, we are budgeting for flat funding,"" Kludt-Painter said. ""I will not make an assumption about any funding increase at this point, especially not based on what happened last year and also now what's happening this year.""

Because the district also has to deal with rising fixed costs -- shipping costs in the case of the Petersburg School District, located on an island -- administrators are now forced to look into cutting staff and programs, Kludt-Painter said.

""And that means kids are impacted,"" Kludt-Painter said. ""It is not the right direction.""

In the emailed statement, a spokesman for Gov. Dunleavy said, ""No school district - rural or urban - has ever known the exact amount of funding they will receive from the state until the operating and capital budgets are passed and signed into law. That process is usually completed in June. This year is no different. What was different this year was that the House Majority decided to start discussing education from the very beginning of the session rather than waiting until the final days.""

Cuts to staff, student nutrition and basketball?

Like urban Alaska districts, many rural districts are considering upping the student-teacher ratio, increasing class sizes, combining grade levels and cutting positions and programs.

Northwest Arctic Borough School District officials are thinking of reducing funding for sports and student activities, which include volleyball, track, Eskimo Olympics, and basketball.

""The main one is basketball,"" Hansen said. ""Our students - that's what drives them to go to school, you know, sometimes the motivation they need to stay in school and to be healthy.""

The Kuspuk school district is considering cutting multiple staff positions, combining some grade levels and cutting the cross-country team -- a decision that superintendent Aguillard said felt painful to even consider.

""I absolutely don't want to cut any opportunity for students,"" she said, adding that she continually hears from families and the community how important sports are. The district currently offers no electives for its students, and employs just two administrators.

Years of flat funding has meant the district has struggled to hire enough staff for each of its schools -- about 20% of its teaching positions are vacant, Aguillard said. She said she's had to rely on remote instructors in some cases.

""Online learning is quite expensive, so this doesn't save any money,"" she said. ""We really want in-person, live teachers in our classrooms.""

The Yupiit school district is ""looking at every item in our budget to see if there's a place where we can save money,"" superintendent Ballard said. ""But when 80% of our budget goes to salaries and benefits, what do you do?"" he said.

Also on the table as a potential cut is a program that helps provide free breakfasts and lunches to all students, Ballard said. The federal government reimburses some -- but not all -- of the cost of that program.

The district spent over $300,000 of its general fund last year on that program, and Ballard said the cut would be hard on many students and their families.

""That's a big incentive for a lot of students to come to school,"" he said.

A recent, yearlong backlog at the Alaska Division of Public Assistance caused many families around the state to go months without federal food stamp and other public assistance benefits. The crisis took a particular toll in rural Alaska, which generally has fewer food banks and pantries to fill the gap.

""It's so important for them to come to school and have a meal and be ready to learn,"" said Hansen with the Northwest Arctic Borough School District, which is also considering cutting the free meal program, he said.

Depleting emergency funds

School districts are also eyeing their emergency funds. In rural Alaska, that means spending money reserved for fixing broken infrastructure and dealing with weather emergencies -- things that come up.

Last year, the Northwest Arctic Borough School District district had to spend close to $1 million to fix water and sewer leaks and address failing fire panel systems, Hansen said.

Now administrators might have to use all of the fund balance, $4.7 million, to cover their budget costs, Hansen said.

""What are we going to do when we have an emergency?"" Hansen said. ""Those situations are real, you know. ... Not only do we have to teach our children, but we have to operate and maintain the facilities that were built many years ago.""

Dillingham's school district is also planning to dip into its emergency savings for the first time in years in order to avoid cuts and still be able to offer raises to teachers, said Amy Brower, the district's superintendent.

Rural school administrators said they were thankful to the lawmakers who had advocated for an increase in public school funding -- but deeply frustrated that the education bill did not pass.

""It seems to me that our state government has forgotten the people it serves. It's our children and Alaska's future that's being jeopardized,"" Hansen said. ""It's so hard to believe anymore when some of those legislators voted against (overriding the veto) but say they're for education. It's so disheartening.""

The way some legislators spoke about student performance also drew criticism from some rural school officials. During floor discussions prior to the veto override, several Republican lawmakers who supported the veto questioned investing money in schools with Alaska's low test scores.

Ballard with the Yupiit school district said standardized testing was not the best or only way to measure student achievement, particularly in rural Alaska.

""We're trying to design a system that is more aligned with Native ways of learning; that's embedded in Native values, culture and language,"" he said. ""And when you don't have a system that measures or values that, then what you have is people in Juneau or in other parts of Alaska who basically look at one dataset -- standardized test scores -- and say, 'Oh my gosh, these kids all over Alaska are not thriving, and they're not doing well.' And I think that's a mistake.""

Hansen pointed out that the way the districts' performance is evaluated is not taking into account the technological disparities.

""It can take days for our students to take the test to which we cater determination on how well our students are learning,"" Hansen said.

Aguillard said her students frequently get kicked out of the online system mid-test due to lagging internet connections, and are often forced to start their tests over multiple times.

""How can we talk about accountability when 100% of standardized tests are given online, but we don't have reliable internet access in our schools?"" she said.

Despite the frustration that many administrators said they were feeling, many said they were still heartened to see such impassioned pleas for improvements to public education in the Legislature.

""These last few years, it's hard to feel that our kids aren't being valued,"" Kludt-Painter said, but added that a lot of driven and educated people in the state ""remain committed to providing high-quality education to kids.""

""There is still time to pass an increase to the BSA this session,"" a Dunleavy spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Education will certainly be funded this year.""",adn.com,news,Anchorage Daily News,"Annie Berman, Alena Naiden",-0.207843137254902,448910866,1,https://www.adn.com/resizer//Nz4U1aCCU6jYFcCZb1dTe-SrgPY=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/VQHDXUG2NJDPJN6U6MTLS3FKHU.jpg,

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

By the end of the period, this will result in a huge market volume of $275 billion.

With such staggering figures, itâs no wonder that so many companies are keen to capitalize on this growth and catapult their digital health products to worldwide success. One such company is Kilo Health, a creator and investor of more than 30 global health and wellness brands.

Back in 2013, Kilo Health was founded by entrepreneur Tadas Burgaila, and the company began in just one room, with one product, and only seven employees. Fast forward a decade, and Kilo Health is now the second fastest-growing company in Europe.Â

With over 600 talented employees, several working hubs across Europe, and more than 6.5 million happy customers worldwide, the digital health visionaries have certainly seen their fair share of success.Â

Not only do they have an impressive product portfolio of their own, but Kilo Health also uses their industry expertise to help start-up companies take the first steps onto the global stage. Take Pulsetto, for example, a wearable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device that was developed, launched, and scaled through the Kilo Ventures program.

This program, which provides funding opportunities for innovative health and wellness companies with established digital products, helped Pulsettoâs founder Vitalijus Majorovas hit three crucial milestones:

Milestone 1: Product DevelopmentÂ

One of the key supports that Ventures funding provides is in-house research and development. Kilo Health's main area of interest lies in finding solutions for the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases, which they deliver with the help of 600+ expert employees.

As a wearable VNS device that gets to work in just 4 minutes and reduces stress by over 60%, Pulsetto fits the bill perfectly. So, in 2021, Kilo Health invested â'¬50,000 in Pulsetto for the creation of a prototype.Â

During the following year, a further â'¬500,000 of funding from the digital health giants allowed Pulsetto to purchase more equipment, which was essential in designing the final product. This investment also went towards creating the premium mobile app that accompanies the device, which includes custom stimulations and guided meditations.Â

Milestone 2: LaunchÂ

As a start-up accelerator, Kilo Healthâs huge operational capacity and financial resources mean that they can help launch products within a matter of weeks, rather than the months and years that it usually takes. The Ventures program achieves this using a unique IEES model, which details the benefits that digital health start-ups can experience:

Following this model, Pulsetto was able to invest Kilo Healthâs capital in mass producing their VNS device, so that it could be launched to a global audience across Europe and even as far as the United States!

Milestone 3: Growth

The final milestone that Kilo Health funding helps start-up companies reach is the growth stage. Whether through Ventures or the Co-found Program, brands that operate under the Kilo Health umbrella have the perfect opportunity to scale their products with the parent companyâs expertise and reputation.Â

For example, one of Pulsettoâs key scalability goals is to help 100 million people wake up every morning feeling happier and healthier

Thanks to its worldwide exposure under the Kilo Health brand name, the Pulsetto device is now available to be purchased through giant online retailers such as Amazon. As a result, the brand is well on their way to achieving this growth goal!

Guernsey views Vuelo as an opportunity to create something more meaningful than just financial gain.

Now with Vuelo, we are focusing our intention on investments, not just as investors, but as creators and builders,"" Guernsey said in a written statement. ""We build ecosystems of real estate and operating businesses that work together spinning a collective flywheel.

Smerud echoes Guernsey's sentiment. ""Fostering the growth of local businesses is something I've been passionate about for my whole career, and Vuelo is the culmination of that passion. Growth generates employment opportunities, invigorates the local economy, and ultimately leads to a thriving community.""

Yancey's role with Vuelo will be to build out scalable systems and processes, integrating acquisitions, and executing growth strategy. ""Building on the success of Waypoint, Vuelo represents an incredible opportunity to scale generational impact in Northern Colorado and beyond,"" Yancey said.

Rounding out the group is Tom Hall, partner and director of asset management at Waypoint Real Estate. ""Investing in operating businesses is like being an architect of economic growth,"" Hall said. ""We have the opportunity to identify and nurture promising local companies, helping them reach their full potential.

Ideal candidates will have top-line revenue between $1 million and $10 million.

Vuelo has eight start-ups, acquisitions or partnerships under its belt and several more in progress.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed Congress' $1.2 trillion spending package, finalizing the remaining batch of bills in a long-awaited budget to keep the government funded until Oct. 1.

Almost halfway into the fiscal year, the president's signature ends a months-long saga of Congress struggling to secure a permanent budget resolution and instead passing stopgap measures to just nearly avert government shutdowns.

The weekend budget deal slid in just under the wire before the Friday midnight funding deadline, as has been typical this fiscal year with eleventh-hour disagreements derailing near-complete deals.

The Senate passed the budget in a 74-24 vote at roughly 2 a.m. ET Saturday morning, technically two hours after the deadline due to last-minute disagreements. However, the White House said that it would not begin official shutdown operations since a deal had ultimately been secured and only procedural actions remained.

The House passed its own vote Friday morning after a week of scrambling to reconcile a lingering sticking point: funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which the White House took issue with last weekend. The White House's qualms delayed the negotiation process further, just as lawmakers were preparing to release the legislative text of the budget proposal.

This trillion-dollar tranche of six appropriation bills will fund agencies related to defense, financial services, homeland security, health and human services and more. Congress approved $459 billion for the first six appropriations bills earlier in March, which related to agencies that were less partisan and easier to negotiate.

With the government finally funded for the rest of the fiscal year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has cleared his plate of at least one looming issue.

But in so doing, he may have created another.

Hours before the House passed the spending package Friday morning, hardline House Republicans held a press conference to lambast the bill. Moments after the House narrowly passed the bill, far-right Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Johnson.

If ousting a House speaker for budget disagreements feels like a familiar story, that's because it is.

In October, after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown, the House voted to remove him, making him the first Speaker in history to be removed from that position. Johnson has been trying to appease the hardline Republican wing of the House, called the Freedom Caucus, to avoid meeting a similar fate.",nbclosangeles.com,news,NBC Southern California,,-0.01960784313725494,448910621,1,https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/02/107379046-1709054499883-gettyimages-2036072119-1111_10.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

(AP) -- President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The weekend budget deal slid in just under the wire before the Friday midnight funding deadline, as has been typical this fiscal year with eleventh-hour disagreements derailing near-complete deals.

The Senate passed the budget in a 74-24 vote at roughly 2 a.m. ET Saturday morning, technically two hours after the deadline due to last-minute disagreements. However, the White House said that it would not begin official shutdown operations since a deal had ultimately been secured and only procedural actions remained.

The House passed its own vote Friday morning after a week of scrambling to reconcile a lingering sticking point: funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which the White House took issue with last weekend. The White House's qualms delayed the negotiation process further, just as lawmakers were preparing to release the legislative text of the budget proposal.

This trillion-dollar tranche of six appropriation bills will fund agencies related to defense, financial services, homeland security, health and human services and more. Congress approved $459 billion for the first six appropriations bills earlier in March, which related to agencies that were less partisan and easier to negotiate.

With the government finally funded for the rest of the fiscal year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has cleared his plate of at least one looming issue.

But in so doing, he may have created another.

Hours before the House passed the spending package Friday morning, hardline House Republicans held a press conference to lambast the bill. Moments after the House narrowly passed the bill, far-right Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Johnson.

If ousting a House speaker for budget disagreements feels like a familiar story, that's because it is.

In October, after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown, the House voted to remove him, making him the first Speaker in history to be removed from that position.

House Speaker Pat Grassley of New Hartford says it provides certainty for students with disabilities and their parents and, in total, amounts to a five percent increase in state support of schools.

House Republican Leader Matt Windschitl of Missouri Valley says it sends a clear and concise message to the Senate.

Under the plan, AEAs would continue to get 90 percent of state funding for special education services. School districts would be able to spend the remaining 10 percent on district employees, private contractor or continue to use AEA staff. The plan passed with the support of 51 of the 60 House Republicans present last Thursday night and is similar to three bills that passed the House in February. House Democratic Leader Jennifer Konfrst says adjustments in the package appear to be concessions to Governor Kim Reynolds. who called for a major overhaul of AEAs in January.

Democrats argued the package falls far short of the state financial support schools need. Representative Sharon Steckman, a Democrat from Mason City who's a retired teacher, says the plan weakens the AEA system because it reduces funding for other AEA services, like teacher training and bulk purchasing of school supplies.

Representative Chad Ingels, a Republican from Randalia who voted for the bill, says as the father of two children with Down Syndrome, he fought to get more pay for paraeducators in the package.

Republican Representative Skyler Wheeler of Hull, the bill's floor manager, has a daughter who's been diagnosed with autism and he also emphasized the importance of paraeducators and keeping AEAs directly involved in special education services.

A few weeks ago, the House took separate votes on general state aid for schools and on teacher pay. The package that cleared the House last Thursday night includes the governor's call for raise salaries for beginning teachers to $50,000, plus money to raise the pay of veteran teachers and hourly staff. In a written statement, Governor Reynolds said the House plan paves a path forward to further strengthen Iowa's education system in meaningful ways. Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said Senate Republicans will discuss the House package next week and he looks forward to a resolution on education funding, raising starting teacher pay and AEA reform.",kiow.com,news,Mix 107.3 KIOW,,0.2784313725490195,448910403,1,https://kiow.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bigstock-Reading-Book-Opening-Books-Fo-371639446_8459484.jpg,eng-9415940

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

The legislation will next be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, which he's expected to do Saturday.

The vote marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

While final passage came after the midnight deadline, the Senate's action effectively prevented any lapse in funding or government function, and the federal government is now funded through the end of the fiscal year.

The Senate's vote comes after the end of a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill, highlighting how narrow the majorities are in both chambers are and how high tensions are running among lawmakers. Immediately after the House voted to pass the legislation the Senate is considering, firebrand Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to oust Johnson from the speakership. While the resolution does not need to be addressed immediately, it represents the most formal and strident challenge to the speaker's leadership since he took over in late last year. The final House vote was 286-134, with 112 Republicans and 22 Democrats voting against.

Despite the House voting earlier in the day Friday, voting in the Senate was delayed for hours amid negotiations over an agreement to speed passage in the chamber. Republicans had demanded votes on controversial amendments that put some vulnerable Senate Democrats in tough political spots.

The funding bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Lawmakers unveiled the $1.2 trillion government funding package just before 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, and the text is more than 1,000 pages long.

Schumer said Thursday that the text for the legislative package came ""in the nick of time,"" with fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown. The Democratic leader added, ""Now Congress must now race to pass this package before government funding runs out this Friday. Once the House acts, the Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday's deadline and avoid a shutdown,"" a reference to how any one senator could slow passage of the bill and launch a partial shutdown.

After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year.

Johnson, who won the gavel after McCarthy's ouster, faces an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight. With the House starting a two-week recess on Friday, Greene's resolution to oust Johnson will hang over the GOP conference as it considers what to do next in the 118th Congress.

Johnson praised the bill early Thursday morning, outlining conservative wins in the package.

""This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,"" Johnson said in a statement.

House members on both sides of the aisle lashed out Thursday over the agreement, with progressives and far-right members criticizing the legislation for different reasons.

GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN he won't be supporting any Republican who votes for the bill and that leadership ""owns the bill,"" describing the bill as a ""failure.""

""I would have a very difficult time doing that,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju. ""The Republican conference is a failure if they pass this bill.""

House progressives have also been critical with some indicating they will vote against it over provisions that will withhold funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for one year amid the alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack against Israel.

McCarthy's fate has raised questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership, but many Republicans have made clear they do not want another speaker's race after the intense infighting and chaos triggered by McCarthy's removal.

The separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills after Congress had passed the long overdue legislation just hours earlier, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown.

The White House said Biden signed the legislation at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was spending the weekend. It had cleared the Senate by a 74-24 vote shortly after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight.

But the White House had sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing that the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

It took lawmakers six months into the current budget year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies. The second covered the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and State, as well as other aspects of general government.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

On Ukraine aid, which Biden and his administration have argued was critical and necessary to help stop Russia's invasion, the package provided $300 million under the defense spending umbrella. That funding is separate from a large assistance package for Ukraine and Israel that is bogged down on Capitol Hill.

To win over support from Republicans, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pointed to some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. But shortly before midnight, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a breakthrough.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said.

The House passed the legislation Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove McCarthy.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Both the House and Senate begrudgingly OK'd the colossal bill, again warding off a partial shutdown and funding the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security, Foreign Operations, the IRS, Congress and Labor. Those agencies account for two-thirds of government funding.

Democrats and Republicans claimed victories in the compromise bill.

""We have funded the government with significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more,"" Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said. ""Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk.""

Democrats celebrated 12,000 additional visas for Afghans who helped the U.S. war effort and $1 billion more for Head Start programs across the country, among other additions.

Republicans lauded the legislation for maintaining a general ban on government funding for most abortions, clawing back billions of dollars from the IRS, blocking the Consumer Product Safety Commission from banning gas stoves and paying for thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement beds.

House Speaker Mike Johnson heralded the bill as a way to ween Congress off the cycle of relying on massive, catch-all spending bills known as omnibuses, despite many Republicans contending that the latest two spending packages are no different from the status quo.

""During the [fiscal 2024] appropriations process, House Republicans achieved conservative policy wins, rejected extreme Democrat proposals and imposed substantial cuts while significantly strengthening national defense,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""The process was also an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory and represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

Now, lawmakers have left Washington for two weeks and will return in April to face issues that were put on the back burner during the protracted spending cycle.

The road ahead is particularly treacherous for Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican. The House GOP is incredibly divided and struggling to maintain its grip on the majority as more Republicans exit from Congress early.

Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher's decision to leave Congress early on April 19, coupled with Colorado Rep. Ken Buck's exit Friday, means that Mr. Johnson will soon have a one-vote majority to move crucial legislation.

Lawmakers have pressured the speaker for months to consider Ukraine aid, which he said would happen once the spending fight ended. Congress must also consider how to handle reforms in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act's Section 702, which grants the government key spying powers and is set to expire in April.

Then, there's work on the fiscal 2025 spending cycle, which was delayed. Some conservatives fear the next process will yield the same outcomes and do little to hack away at the government's colossal debt.

Moving along with spending work could be hampered by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger, Texas Republican, who on Friday said she would step down from the position. Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, has emerged as a likely replacement.

Also on the horizon is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to oust Mr. Johnson for passing the colossal spending package. She has yet to trigger the motion to vacate, which was the same procedure used to ax former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but said it should be considered a warning.

Her anger and continued dysfunction in the House GOP signal that fractures in the House have grown wider than before and will make passing legislation difficult for the speaker without aid from Democrats.",washingtontimes.com,news,Washington Times,Alex Miller,0.1215686274509804,448909897,1,https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2022/11/08/APTOPIX_Election_2022_Congress_06835--758af.dup~frXP8t_c0-251-6000-3749_s1770x1032.jpg?21cd7831eab7ad0be624c464dc808fe93f3b603e,eng-9411206

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the $1.2 trillion legislation that completes the funding of federal agencies through the fiscal year, which ends September 30.

The House passed the package on Friday, and the Senate passed it early Saturday morning.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

The signing of the legislation marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

This legislation is the second part of a two-tiered government funding process. A separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.",cnn.com,news,CNN,Clare Foran,-0.04313725490196074,448909785,1,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-03-19t212923z-984337648-rc29p6amqbbq-rtrmadp-3-usa-election-biden.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",eng-9411206

The funding will grow the university's ability to deliver high quality Level 6 degree apprenticeships on both current and new apprenticeships with either low uptake or in priority areas, giving access to more potential students. They will begin in April 2024.

The University of Greenwich was one of only three (out of a total of 32) institutions to receive over £1 million in funding, and secured the second most funding in total.

Apprenticeships are an efficient way for students to up-skill or retrain directly into the career, if not the company they wish to work in, allowing them to earn as they learn.

The providers of the apprenticeships include organisations like the Ministry of Defence, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and FM Conway.

The university will offer the following apprenticeships:

With 50% of its students being first in their family to go to university and 57% of students identifying as BAME, the University of Greenwich vision of 'Education Without Boundaries' includes widening access to higher education for individuals, fighting for improved social mobility and equality and diversity and inclusivity. The university aims to grow to 5000 apprenticeships by 2030 in high demand sectors and those important to the local area.

Professor Jane Harrington, Vice Chancellor and CEO of the University of Greenwich said:

'We are delighted to have been successful in our bid. We are always looking at ways to improve our offering to not only widen access to higher education but also to provide much-needed skills for the future.'

John Blake, Director for Fair Access and Participation at the OfS, said:

'With this second round of bids, we were looking for universities and colleges to not only describe how OfS funding would expand their degree apprenticeships student numbers and course provision, but also to further demonstrate how they would prioritise recruiting and supporting students from all backgrounds to succeed. I'm pleased to say that all the successful bids have risen to this challenge.'",indiaeducationdiary.in,news,"India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary",,0.3411764705882352,448909739,1,https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/University-of-Greenwich.jpg?w=640,

The US Congress early on Saturday overwhelmingly passed a $1.2 trillion budget bill, which included a ban on US funding for UNRWA until 2025.

The bill also eliminates funding for the UN Commission of Inquiry against Israel and fully funds the annual US security commitment of $3.3 billion for Israel, which allocates funding for the Iron Dome and other defensive systems.

""The historic ban on US funding to @UNRWA that passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and can not be part of the solution. UNRWA will not be a part of Gaza's landscape in the aftermath of Hamas,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a post on X.

""Thousands of UNRWA employees are involved in Hamas terror activities and their facilities were used for terrorist purposes. I urge more countries to follow the US and ban funding to this organization. Thank you @SpeakerJohnson, @RepJeffries @SenSchumer @LeaderMcConnell for your leadership and continued bipartisan support of Israel during our just war against Hamas murderous terrorist regime,"" Katz added.

President Joe Biden's administration said in January it was temporarily pausing new funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) after Israel accused 12 of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas attack.

Additional features of the bill

The bill also forces the UN and other international organizations funded in the bill to assess and report on efforts to combat anti-Israel bias and antisemitism and to vet personnel for connections to terrorist groups, the Act withholds funds from the UN Human Rights Council to hold it accountable for blatant anti-Israel actions and reform the Council's election process to prevent human rights abusers from becoming members.

Opening a Plaid Cymru debate, Rhun ap Iorwerth said having to make a case for fair funding speaks volumes about Wales' status within an unequal union.

He told the chamber the population-based Barnett formula, which was devised in the late 1970s and only intended as a temporary measure, does not reflect the needs of Wales.

The Plaid Cymru leader described the funding formula as a weak, short-term solution from the 20th century based on the needs of another country.

He said: ""It has become more and more apparent over the years that the Barnett formula is well past its sell-by date.""

'Barriers'

Calling out apathy at Westminster, Mr Iorwerth accused the Conservatives of placing barriers before any attempts to reform and he criticised Labour for refusing to promise change.

He urged the new first minister to stand up for Wales, saying: ""I want to hear a Labour first minister putting Wales first and not taking 'no' for an answer from Keir Starmer.""

Mr Iorwerth told MSs the Barnett formula has been a cornerstone for a broader pattern of unfairness faced by Wales in recent years.

He raised examples such as a lack of powers over the Crown Estate and £4bn in consequential funding for Wales from the HS2 project being withheld.

The Ynys Môn MS said: ""This general theme of injustice that flows through all of those cases, and more, all emerge fundamentally from the failure to have fair and appropriate funding arrangements in place, and the Barnett formula is at the heart of that.""

'Record funding'

Peter Fox said Wales continues to receive record funding, with the largest block grant in the history of devolution supplemented by about £440m of levelling-up funding.

The Conservatives' shadow finance minister agreed that there needs to be a rethink about how the Barnett formula is calculated to better address Wales' unique challenges.

Mr Fox said some strides were made to make the settlement fairer, with a 115% funding floor agreed between the Welsh and UK Governments in 2016.

He told the chamber: ""That ensures the Welsh settlement will never drop below 115% of the money spent on public services in England. But we know currently that that floor hasn't had to kick in, as the current settlement is delivering 120%, ie £1.20 for every £1 spent.""

Mr Fox stopped short of calling for the Barnett formula to be scrapped, saying it would be unrealistic in the UK context.

'Utterly unsustainable'

Peredur Owen Griffiths, Plaid Cymru's shadow minister, said the state of the Welsh budget for the financial year from April shows in stark terms how poorly Wales is served.

He warned: ""The experiences of the past few months have conclusively demonstrated that Welsh public finances are on an utterly unsustainable trajectory.""

The South Wales East MS argued the Barnett formula is ill-equipped to address the precarious state of council finances, with the threat of bankruptcy looming large.

He told the chamber that Wales' 22 councils have a combined debt of £5.6bn, according to a UK public accounts committee report, with a £354m funding gap next year.

He said: ""It would take a work of fiscal fiction that Jeremy Hunt himself would be proud of to argue the Barnett formula, in its current form, is sufficient to rectify this dire predicament.""

'Vital investment'

Mabon ap Gwynfor focused on the needs of Wales, saying: ""The truth is, it's more expensive to provide health and social care to older, more rural and impoverished communities.""

He argued replacing the Barnett formula should be regarded as a vital investment in health.

Sioned Williams, a fellow Plaid Cymru MS, said a needs-based model would not be an instant panacea but it would undoubtedly be a necessary step in the right direction.

She said: ""We need to be honest with voters that the current arrangements will only keep us standing still on a path to a fairer and more equal society.""

Mike Hedges, a Labour backbencher, pointed out that the local government funding formula shows that a needs-based solution can still be controversial.

""The discussion we need is about how to get a needs-based framework to work,"" he said.

'Quick fixes'

Rebecca Evans told the chamber it is clear the UK funding model does not work for Wales.

The finance minister said the funding system for devolved governments is characterised by quick fixes, inconsistency, uncertainty and instability.

Ms Evans called for a new relative needs-based approach, overseen by a body independent of the UK Government and to be agreed by all four nations

She said: ""That would be fairer but also more efficient and effective, and it would help reduce the distortions and inefficiencies that arise from the current system.

""It would enable a more rational, transparent allocation of public spending across the UK.""

The technical summary data tells us to buy ILCB near 70.87, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 70.67 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 70.87 is the first level of support below 72.13, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 70.87 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy ILCB just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 72.13, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ILCB if it tests n/a with a downside target of 72.1. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 72.64 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy ILCB just slightly over 72.64, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 72.47 in case the stock turns against the trade. 72.64 is the first level of resistance above 72.13, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 72.64, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of ILCB if it tests 72.64 with a downside target of 72.1. We should have a stop loss in place at 72.81 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 72.64, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

According to Peter C. Earle, senior economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, investors comparing these two firms can look at a handful of differentiating features.

""Comparing the gross profit margins of each gives an idea of how efficiently the two translate revenues into profits, and higher margins equate to better management of costs and possibly more pricing power in the market,"" he said. ""Both of those, over time, mean higher earnings, which in turn tends to mean higher stock prices.""

In addition, Earle noted that for retail firms such as these, those with a higher store count and a broader geographic presence are likely to have better prospects for medium- to long-term growth - in addition to being diversified against regional/state issues.

""A very general rule of thumb is to compare store sales growth, which is to say the revenue increase for stores that have been open for one year or longer,"" he added, noting that comparing store sales growth between two firms can reveal whether one is generating growth by organic measures as opposed to simply opening as many new locations as possible.

According to the earnings report, Dollar Tree reported a net loss of $1.71 billion, or $7.85 per share, in the quarter that ended Feb. 3. In comparison, a year-ago profit was $452.2 million, or $2.04 per share, according to CNBC.

The company also announced on March 13 that it would close 600 Family Dollar stores in the first half of fiscal 2024, and 370 additional stores as their leases expire, as GOBankingRates previously reported.

""Persistent inflation and reduced government benefits continue to pressure the lower-income consumers that comprise a sizable portion of Family Dollar's customer base,"" CEO Rick Dreiling said on a call with analysts, according to the transcript.

CFRA Research's opinion is Sell, according to a March 16 research note.

""While the Dollar Tree banner continues to exceed expectations, the Family Dollar banner continues to underperform in several metrics,"" Equity Analyst Arun Sundaram, CFA, CPA, wrote in the note.

In addition, CFRA expects FY 25 to be another challenging year.

""DLTR's decision to close about 1,000 underperforming Family Dollar stores raises questions about the long-term growth of this banner,"" added Sundaram.

For the fourth quarter-ending Feb. 2 - net sales decreased 3.4% to $9.9 billion, compared to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, according to the earnings report.

CFRA Research's opinion on the stock is that it should be bought, according to a March 16 note.

Here, Sundaram argued that while the last few years have been challenging for DG, given weak macroeconomic conditions and some self-inflicted wounds, ""we believe the company, which is being re-led by CEO Todd Vasos, is on the right track.""

""Staffing and inventory levels have already improved, and the goal for FY 2025 will be to address shrink and realize supply chain efficiencies,"" said Sundaram. ""We see further upside should the macro environment improve and discretionary sales rebound.""

The European Union has helped fund drone technology used by Israel in its devastating war in Gaza, a monitor has claimed.

Statewatch and Informationsstelle Militarisierung (IMI) found in an analysis that Xtend - a drone manufacturer reportedly supporting the Israeli Defence Force - received a research and development grant from the EU's Horizon Europe fund.

The two organisations added that ""other Israeli military companies and institutions received millions of euros for drone development in recent years, despite a supposed prohibition on EU funding for military and defence projects.""

The European Commission has been approached for comment.

Xtend received €50,000 from Horizon Europe, a multi-billion research and innovation fund, to produce a study on optimising its Skylord Xtender drone system and finding ""strategic partners for the production and commercialisation of the technology,"" Statewatch and IMI wrote in a statement published on Friday.

The company then signed contracts with the US Department of Defence in 2021, which involved Israel's military, according to the monitors.

Following Hamas' 7 October attack on southern Israel, Xtend has ""redirected energies to supporting the IDF 100%,"" CEO Aviv Shapira told CTECH.

On its website, which features testimonials from Israeli troops in Gaza, Xtend says it enables ""soldiers to perform accurate manoeuvres in complex combat scenarios.""

""Human rights groups have called on the EU to suspend its association agreement with Israel due to the disastrous effects of the latter's assault on Gaza: huge civilian casualties, mass displacement and the razing of infrastructure,"" said Statewatch director Chris Jones.

""This report shows that the EU also needs to take a long, hard look at the companies it provides with research and development funding.

""Public money should be used for the public good, not to support companies that profit from war and destruction,"" he added.

EU treaties prohibit financing ""expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications.""

The Statewatch-IMI report reported several other EU-funded projects through which millions of euros in public money was given to Israeli companies and institutions, including the country's Ministry of Defence.

Israel's Ministry of Defence has been involved in at least two EU-backed drone research projects in recent years - ResponDrone and UnderSec - receiving a total of €200,000 for its work, according to the monitors.

They report that ResponDrone, which began in May 2019, received almost €8 million in EU funding for its efforts to develop an unmanned aerial system to support emergency services and search and rescue operations.

Meanwhile, UnderSec has been awarded €6 million in funding from Brussels to develop systems ""featuring multimodal sensors and robotic assets"" that can be used in drone technology.

Both projects have ""clear potential military applications,"" the report claimed.

This is not the first time EU funding for Israeli military and defence projects has been questioned.

In February, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Clare Daly raised concerns that Horizon Europe money- funded by European taxpayers - was being allocated to controversial Israeli-made Pegasus spyware, used to target journalists and politicians around the world.

""From the beginning, the EU's 'security research' aimed at dual-use and was a gift to the European, Turkish and Israeli arms industry,"" said Christoph Marischka of the IMI.

""It is a logical consequence that the outcomes of this research are now applied on various battlefields - like Gaza.""

In 2021, a group of 60 left and green MEPs urged the European Commission to suspend Israel's participation in Horizon Europe, claiming the country does not respect the values the EU purports to enshrine in the €95.5 billion research and innovation programme.

MEPs said at the time Israel should be barred until it ensures the rights of Palestinians.

Duke Energy released on Friday that they're hoping to build the Robinson Solar Center, a major facility near a nuclear plant adding solar power in Chesterfield and Darlington counties.

""Making smart investments in South Carolina's energy future is a priority for Duke Energy - one that focuses on delivering reliable, affordable service every day to the customers and communities we serve, and on transitioning to cleaner energy options and a lower carbon future,"" said Mike Callahan, Duke Energy's South Carolina state president. ""The proposed Robinson Solar Center is part of the thousands of megawatts of solar that will help us do that.""

If the project is approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, construction will begin in 2026 and start providing fuel-free energy by 2027.

The project will also create more than 200 new construction jobs.

According to the Census Bureau, South Carolina had the fastest-growing population in the nation in 2023. Duke Energy says those growing energy needs require a diverse mix of resources.

New Delhi: Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in India this fiscal has seen steady growth in debt investment in sharp contrast to the volatile equity investment, V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",thehansindia.com,news,The Hans India,Geojit Financial Services,-0.05882352941176472,448906418,1,https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/01/29/1418825-fpi.jpg,eng-9420238

Known as commercial real estate collateralized loan obligations, or CRE CLOs, they bundle debt that would usually be seen as too speculative for conventional mortgage-backed securities into bonds of varying risk and return.

In just the last seven months the share of troubled assets held by these niche products has surged four-fold, by one measure, to more than 7.4 percent. For the hardest hit, delinquency rates are in the double digits. That's left major players in the $80 billion market rushing to rework loans, while short sellers are ramping up attacks on publicly-traded issuers they say may be so beset by missed payments that they have little to no equity value.

The pain is part of a broader shakeout in the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market, which nearly brought down New York Community Bancorp and has elicited warnings from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Yet industry observers say few products are more exposed than CRE CLOs.

That's because they're primarily stuffed full of short-term, floating-rate loans for properties undergoing renovations or expansions, the type of risky debt that banks or CMBS often don't want to hold. With rising interest rates eroding resale prices for refurbished multifamily dwellings and demand for office space still tepid, many borrowers are starting to struggle to meet their obligations. That's left a number of CRE CLO issuers -- which finance the riskiest part of the structures themselves and sell off the safer pieces -- already absorbing losses.

Some say the pain could eventually spread to those invested in less risky portions, too.

""The CRE CLO market is the first shoe to drop in terms of defaults in the CRE debt markets,"" said Mark Neely, director of alternative investments at GenTrust, a money manager. ""The loans inside CRE CLOs tend to be for transitional properties, so the borrowers are counting on reselling them before the loan matures. But today many borrowers can't sell properties for anywhere near where they bought them.""

To be sure, the highest rated debt issued by CRE CLOs benefit from ample protection built into the structure of the securities, and analysts across the board expect those bonds to be just fine. At the bottom of the capital stack, however, it's a different story.

Issuers have been buying time by extending maturities, letting developers pay interest with additional debt, and making other changes to loans to encourage borrowers to keep current.

Modifications often take the form of two- to three-year extensions, in exchange for which borrowers typically are required to inject more capital.

Increasingly, CRE CLO issuers are also buying out delinquent loans via cash reserves, allowing them to avoid tripping asset-coverage tests which causes cash-flow streams to certain investors to get turned off -- a mechanism designed to protect those who purchase less risky portions of the structures.

Firms bought back a record $1.3 billion of delinquent loans last year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates.

""Increased stress in this market has forced managers to take unprecedented steps to protect the integrity of their CRE CLO structures,"" strategists led by Chong Sin wrote in a report last month.

Market watchers say that may partly explain why the share of loans in CRE CLOs with payments more than 30 days overdue fell to 7.4 percent last month, based on data from analytics firm CRED iQ, after peaking at more than 8.5 percent in January. Another measure of CRE CLO loan stress from Citigroup Inc. that uses different criteria touched 4.8 percent in January, the highest in data going back to 2014.

""Incentives in these structures are substantially aligned with bondholders, and there's a strong motivation for sponsors to buy troubled loans out of the trusts,"" said Liza Crawford, co-head of global securitized at TCW Group Inc. Still, she added, ""I don't think everyone is going to have enough money or financing to do that. It's a ticking clock.""

The origins of CRE CLOs date back to before the financial crisis, when commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations, or CRE CDOs, were a routine financing tool. Demand all but disappeared in 2008 as real estate prices plunged and the downfall of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. prompted money managers to shun riskier structured credit products.

Modern CRE CLOs, a rebooted version with more investor protections, first came onto the scene in late 2011.

The basic concept is the same. Non-bank lenders create separate entities to hold tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of commercial real estate loans, and investors buy slices of the vehicles in the form of bonds. In exchange, they get a share of the income thrown off by the underlying loans. Cash flows follow a so-called waterfall structure, wherein the most senior bonds get paid first, while the riskiest slice -- known as the equity -- gets paid last. Any losses in CRE CLOs fall on holders of the most subordinated portions.

CRE CLOs attracted little attention for years. Then in 2021, the pandemic produced the perfect conditions for a surge of issuance. New work-from-home and social distancing norms resulted in more Americans moving into separate households, many of them in the Sunbelt. The result? An unprecedented increase in demand from real estate investors taking out short-term, floating-rate loans to buy apartment buildings, renovate them, and sell them at a profit -- a strategy known as ""fix and flip.""

Issuance of CRE CLOs leaped from $19 billion in 2019 to $45 billion in 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As much as 72 percent of the collateral inside CRE CLOs is backed by multifamily property, with another 13 percent tied to offices, according to figures from real estate data provider Trepp.

Then the problems began.

When the Federal Reserve started hiking rates, it raised the interest burden for developers that took out floating-rate loans hoping to ""flip"" properties. Making matters worse, the pandemic-driven surge in apartment demand soon turned into a supply glut that's still weighing on rents and property prices.

""It was this kind of pig through a python dynamic,"" said Neely. ""All of this demand came through the system at once, and now we're feeling the aftermath.""

'Stress test'

The share of delinquent loans in CRE CLOs from Arbor Realty Trust Inc., one of the industry's largest issuers, touched 9.2 percent in January before sliding back down to 8.1 percent in February, according to CRED iQ data.

Its share price is down 16 percent year-to-date after rising 15 percent in 2023, while about 40 percent of its floating stock is currently sold short, according to data from analytics firm S3 Partners.

Arbor didn't respond to requests seeking comment.

Arbor Chief Executive Officer Ivan Kaufman said on the company's most recent earnings call in mid-February that it is working closely with borrowers to recapitalize deals and is looking to make new loans to keep growing the company's balance sheet.

At least two CRE CLOs from Ready Capital, another major issuer, have already breached safety triggers, while 15 percent of its loans have been transferred to workout specialists known special servicers, according to data from Barclays Plc.

A spokesperson for Ready Capital declined to comment.

Just last week four CRE CLO bonds issued by Blackstone Mortgage Trust were downgraded by Morningstar DBRS because of higher expected losses on underlying loans, with the lowest-rated bond tranche cut to CCC. The downgraded bonds belong to a CLO that's primarily backed by office properties rather than multifamily dwellings.

Short seller Carson Block in December said he was betting against the publicly traded real estate investment trust, predicting that even if the Fed lowers interest rates, losses on its loans could reach well into the billions, wiping out the trust's equity.

In a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday, Block said his firm has grown ""more bearish"" on Blackstone Mortgage Trust since late last year, citing troubles with multifamily properties.

""This kind of reminds me of 2007,"" Block said.

A representative for Blackstone said via email that ""the credit-rating downgrades reflect challenges in the office sector that are well understood by the market,"" adding that all of Blackstone Mortgage Trust's CLO bonds are performing and making payments to investors.

TCW's Crawford sees continued stress for CRE CLO sponsors in this rate environment.

""What we're seeing is a major stress test for a market that is relatively young,"" said Crawford. Issuers ""are really going to have to show their mettle.""",businessmirror.com.ph,news,BusinessMirror,,-0.4274509803921569,448906405,1,https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BusinessMirror-A-broader-look-at-todays-business.jpg,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

WATCH: Brooks and Capehart on the latest round of chaos in the House

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

The US Congress approved a funding bill Saturday in a rare show of cross-party unity, keeping federal agencies running through September and averting a damaging partial government shutdown.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

'It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,' Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

'It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,' he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defence and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

'OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,' the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

'Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.'

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a 'motion to vacate' the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare manoeuvre that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that 'quite a few' Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 per cent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 per cent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programmes, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",newagebd.net,news,New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh,,0.09019607843137245,448905723,1,https://www.newagebd.com/files/records/news/202403/228630_175.jpg,

It has emerged that the league's board wrote to Everton this week confirming it was ""minded to approve"" 777 Partners becoming their new owners subject to stringent conditions being met.

Telegraph Sport has been told those conditions included stipulations around funding for the club and a failure to comply would lead to the takeover being rejected.

The letter represented the beginning of the end of a process that has dragged on for more than six months since 777 first struck a deal with Everton's majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri.

The group has been bankrolling the club since then via a series of multi-million-pound loans and Telegraph Sport has been told it is resigned to continuing to do so beyond the end of this month, with a final decision on the takeover not now expected until after Easter.

One reason given was Everton's hearing into an alleged second breach of English football's Profit and Sustainability Rules, which is expected to be held early next week.

Another is that even if the Premier League board approves the 777 takeover, an independent oversight panel of KCs will be called in to review its conclusions.

The precedent set by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's purchase of Manchester United led insiders to conclude that further process alone will take another seven days.

Telegraph Sport has reported previously how 777 appeared unwilling to provide any further loan funding while the takeover saga dragged on.

By the end of this month, it is expected to have handed Everton £200 million to keep the club going.

The 777 group already has a number of football clubs in its portfolio, including Sevilla, Genoa, Hertha Berlin and Standard Liege, with the fans of the Belgian side holding a demonstration criticising the owners' involvement at their last game.",ca.sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports Canada,Ben Rumsby,-0.1137254901960785,448905667,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/k0L.lXo.MPUwDDYI4y3prA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/4f40fb285eeb02cdd12cd658ab3e0692,

The roof replacement has been an ongoing project, with initial improvements including metal work around the building and underneath the roof completed two years ago.

The county's office building is located at 225 N. Center St. The original roof was installed more than 30 years ago.

""Due to the age of the roof and multiple repairs, the roof has reached its end of life,"" Justin Megonnell, chief of the county's Bureau of Facilities said at the Thursday commissioners meeting.

The roof replacement includes the removal and reinstallation of the duct work for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.

""This roof system will enhance the durability of the roof along with the use of energy-efficient materials,"" Megonnell said. ""Garland DBS has completed phase one of this project along with other roof projects within the county with great success. This roof system will come with a 30-day warranty plan at no additional cost to the county.""

The roof is not the only improvement underway at the decades-old county government building. In December, commissioners unanimously approved a $506,783.56 contract with Eastern Elevator Service and Sales to replace two elevators inside the building.

The elevators to be replaced were installed in 1973, Megonnell said at the time.

""While they remain operational, the cost [of] maintaining them and securing the parts are getting harder and harder to find,"" he said. ""By upgrading both cars under a scheduled project, we're hoping this will minimize the impact on operations.""

The legislation was passed by a vote of 74 to 24 and will now head to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, which he is expected to Saturday.

""We have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government tonight,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X (formerly Twitter) a little after midnight.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it. It is good for the American people that we have reached this bipartisan deal,"" Schumer said.

The final passage came after the midnight deadline, meaning some federal funding technically expired briefly. But the Senate's action means that the federal government is now funded through the end of the fiscal year.

The $1.2T funding package, which runs more than 1K pages long, would provide funding for the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

""We have funded the government with significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more. Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk,"" Schumer said on X.

What is a shutdown?

Several federal agencies rely on annual funding approved by Congress. The agencies submit their requests every year which Congress must pass, and the president has to sign budget legislation for the next fiscal year.

If an agreement is not reached by the start of the fiscal year on October 1, that results in a shutdown in which all non-essential discretionary functions stop.

Usually when the deadline approaches, lawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill agree on temporary funding based on the previous year's requests.

WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped the Senate pass the final six bills to fund the government through Fiscal Year 2024, which runs through September 30, 2024. Peters secured major funding wins in the bipartisan legislation for local projects and issues important to communities across Michigan. The final package of bills now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.

""This bipartisan legislation delivers critical resources to communities across the state of Michigan and our entire country. It will help protect the Great Lakes, secure our borders, strengthen our national security, drive economic growth, and expand access to quality, affordable child care. It shows how much we can do when we put politics aside and bring home commonsense solutions for the American people,"" said Senator Peters.

As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Peters helped the committee pass all twelve annual appropriations bills. Peters is the first Michigan senator to serve on this committee since 1959.

Peters led or supported the following provisions in the funding legislation on issues important to Michiganders:

Strengthening America's National Defense and Homeland Security

Northern Border Coordination Center: Peters secured $3 million to stand up a Northern Border Coordination Center that would be located at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. It will help the Department of Homeland Security coordinate border security efforts across the Northern Border, and support personnel training and high-tech border security technology testing. Peters has also advanced bipartisan legislation in the Senate to establish the Northern Border Coordination Center and to ensure assets like Selfridge remain at the forefront of the nation's homeland and national security missions.

Exercise Northern Strike: Peters secured a provision in this bill providing $23.5 million in funding to support Exercise Northern Strike - the National Guard Bureau's largest joint service, multicomponent exercise. Northern Strike takes place annually at the National All-Domain Warfighting Center (NADWC), which utilizes both the Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center and the Alpena Combat Readiness Center, which are both based in Northern Michigan.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft: Peters secured language in the bill authorizing a report that will clarify the basing criteria for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and evaluate whether existing Air National Guard units, such as Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, are appropriate basing candidates for CCA. These types of unmanned aircraft are the future of warfare, and this report will help Selfridge Air National Guard Base better position itself as an installation that has significant long-term value for the Air Force. Last year, Peters underscored the importance of CCA technology in a confirmation hearing for Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General David W. Allvin.

Stryker Armored Vehicles: The bill provides $4.2 million to help the Army update the Stryker Family of Armored Vehicles with driver-assistance technology. This funding will support autonomous capability efforts taking place at the Ground Vehicles Systems Center (GVSC) in Warren, and help ensure that Made in Michigan ground vehicles like the Strykers are operating with cutting edge technology designed to keep our servicemembers safe.

High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs): The legislation provides $47.5 million for the Army to upgrade its HMMWVs with anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control systems that will help prevent rollovers, which have claimed the lives of far too many servicemembers. These kits are made in Troy and this funding would help support over 150 jobs.

Hiring Additional Customs and Border Protection Personnel: The bill includes funding to hire additional CBP Officers to interdict illegal drugs like fentanyl and facilitate safe and secure lawful trade and travel and ensure that states like Michigan can remain international hubs of commerce. It also includes funding for additional Border Patrol Agents who support the border security mission between ports of entry. Peters has led bipartisan legislation to fully staff America's ports of entry.

Border Security Technology The bill includes funding for critical technology for CBP and between ports of entry that enhances front line personnel to carry out their border security mission. This includes non-intrusive inspection systems, which enable CBP's to inspect of vehicles and cargo entering the United States more effectively and efficiently. This also includes funding to support outbound inspections. Peters has led bipartisan legislation to increase the use of these systems to ensure secure travel and trade at ports of entry.

Gordie Howe International Bridge: The bill also helps the Department of Homeland Security continue to prepare for the completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge by providing $1M to Homeland Security Investigations to increase capacity to support investigations resulting from the use of non-intrusive inspection systems that will be deployed at the bridge.

Blue Water Bridge: The bill requires Customs and Border Protection to report on its plans for completion of the Blue Water Bridge Plaza expansion project, as well as its steps taken in the last year toward completion. Peters has long worked with state and federal partners to modernize this port of entry.

Helping Communities Recover from Disaster: Peters secured significant funding in the bill for the Disaster Relief Fund, a program which enables the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help communities recover in the wake of disasters and emergencies. Peters has been a leader in passing legislation to help disaster survivors get back on their feet.

Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP): The bill includes funding for the NSGP, which Peters haschampioned, to help religious institutions, including synagogues, churches, mosques, gurdwaras, and other nonprofits strengthen their security in the face of rising threats and attacks. Peters helped lead the reauthorization of this essential program last Congress.

Support for Local Firefighters: The bill includes funding for FEMA's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grant program, which provide resources to help local fire departments hire and retain personnel, purchase safety equipment, conduct trainings and access health screenings for firefighters. Peters passed bipartisan legislation in the Senate to extend these critical programs, which are set to expire.

DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office: The bill provides funding for DHS's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, allowing it to continue operations through September 30, 2024. The office leads DHS's effort to safeguard the country from threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, which include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to reauthorize and improve this vital office.

Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs: The bill provides funding for the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA), which coordinates the Department of State's diplomatic, family, congressional, and external engagements related to overseas hostage-taking and wrongful detention, such as in the case of Michigander Paul Whelan. SPEHA's mission is to secure the freedom of U.S. national hostages and wrongful detainees held abroad, support their families, and end the practice of hostage-taking and wrongful detention as coercive diplomatic practices.

Office of the National Cyber Director: The bill includes funding for the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), which coordinates a whole-of-government approach to implement federal cybersecurity strategy. The ONCD's mission is to advance national security, economic prosperity, and technological innovation through cybersecurity policy. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led numerous efforts to increase our nation's cybersecurity defenses and build resilience across critical infrastructure sectors.

Investing in Education & Lowering the Cost of Child Care

Funding for K-12 Schools: The bill protects funding for K-12 schools through Title I-A grants to provide financial assistance to schools with high numbers of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children can receive a quality education and meet state academic standards.

Head Start: The bill increases funding for Head Start, which ensures children in low-income families can access quality preschool education.

Quality, Affordable Child Care: The bill increases funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which is the primary federal program that expands access to child care for low-income families and improves the quality of child care for all children. The bill also funds the Department of Defense's child care programs, including increased funding for universal pre-K, which will double pre-K enrollment of children of servicemembers.

Assistance to Schools After Violent or Traumatic Events: Peters fought to protect funding in the bill for the Department of Education's Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) Grant Program, which provides critical funding to help schools and colleges respond to and recover from violent or traumatic events.

Expanding Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care

National Institutes of Health (NIH): The bill increases funding for the NIH, including increased funding for mental health research, Alzheimer's research, reducing maternal mortality, and cancer research.

Strengthening Our Health Care Workforce: The bill provides increased funding to strengthen the health care workforce through investments in community health centers, school-based health centers, and efforts to bolster public health infrastructure and rebuild the workforce at the state and local level.

Support for Young People Struggling with Substance Use Disorders: The bill protects funding for the Youth Prevention and Recovery Initiative that Peters established in 2018, which provides grant funding to local health care providers to help expand access to opioid addiction treatment for adolescents. The program also provides grant funding to schools, community organizations, and others to help raise awareness of the risks of fentanyl use among youth. Peters is currently working to renew this program and ensure this critical resource remains available to adolescents, families, care providers, and communities. His bipartisan provision to continue the programadvanced in the Senate earlier this year through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act.

Protecting the Great Lakes

U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes Center of Expertise: The bill provides continued support for the U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes Center of Expertise (GLCOE), which Peters established to examine the impacts of oil spills in freshwater environments and help develop effective responses. The center's work is critical to protecting the Great Lakes, as current oil spill response technologies are primarily designed for saltwater environments. Petersauthored and passed legislation into law establishing the Great Lakes Center of Expertise in 2018, and thenannounced the center will be headquartered in two Michigan locations to maximize research and operational capabilities: Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor.

Great Lakes Icebreaker: The bill provides $20 million for the procurement of a new Great Lakes icebreaker that is at least as capable as the USCGC Mackinaw. Peters has continuously pressed for funding to secure a new icebreaker for the Great Lakes to ensure safe and efficient commerce on the Great Lakes year-round. Icebreaking in the Great Lakes is critical not just for Michigan's economy - but for our entire country. Icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes supports more than 90 million tons of cargo annually. Acquiring an additional heavy icebreaker like the USCGC Mackinaw is needed to prevent ice jam flooding damage to shoreline communities and protect maritime commerce and jobs throughout the Great Lakes region.

Supporting Businesses, Manufacturers & Local Economic Development

LIFT Advanced Manufacturing Center: Peters helped secure $10 million for research and development of critical materials processing to support LIFT's work scaling up commercialization of ceramic-related technology. LIFT, which Peters played a key role in establishing, is an organization in Detroit that brings together industry, academia, and government to advance our nation's economy and national security by accelerating innovative advanced manufacturing technology and talent development.

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund: The bill secures funding for the CDFI Fund, which Peters has championed, to provide credit, capital and financial services to underserved populations and communities in Michigan and across the country. It would also allocate funding for the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund, which Peters has strongly supported, to help low-income-designated credit unions provide financial services for their members and spur economic growth in their communities.

Women's Business Centers: The bill includes funding for Women's Business Centers within the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide low-cost counseling and training for women who want to start, grow, or expand their small business.

Microloan Technical Assistance for Small Businesses: The bill provides funding for the Microloan Program to deliver technical assistance and small-scale loans to small businesses that are unable to qualify for conventional loans and other guaranteed loans.

Making Government More Efficient & Saving Taxpayer Dollars

Conducting Strong Oversight of Taxpayer Dollars: The bill includes continued support for the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), which conducts oversight, improves transparency and addresses fraud within the spending and distribution of pandemic response funds. Peters established this independent oversight committee through a bipartisan provision he authored and secured in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Supporting National Archives Digitization and Operations: The bill provides continued funding for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for digitization of records. This funding will also support NARA's continuing work to provide veterans with access to service records for the purpose of receiving VA benefits.

The bill also includes funding secured by Peters for high-impact public local projects in Michigan that can benefit from federal assistance. For a full list of the projects Peters supported that were included in the bill, click HERE or see below:

Semiconductor Workforce Development at Delta College: The bill provides $284,000 to Delta College to develop curriculum and apprenticeship opportunities in semiconductor production and research. Peters has made strengthening domestic semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains a top priority. Peters helped author and pass into law the historic CHIPS and Science Act, which includes a provision Peters secured to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies and ensure that projects supporting critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion Peters already secured in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S. - for a total of $52 billion. The CHIPS and Science Act also included Peters' bipartisan Investing in Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Act, which will ensure federal incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing include U.S. suppliers that produce the materials and manufacturing equipment that enable semiconductor manufacturing - bolstering semiconductors supply chains and Michigan manufacturers.

It has emerged that the league's board wrote to Everton this week confirming it was ""minded to approve"" 777 Partners becoming their new owners subject to stringent conditions being met.

Telegraph Sport has been told those conditions included stipulations around funding for the club and a failure to comply would lead to the takeover being rejected.

The letter represented the beginning of the end of a process that has dragged on for more than six months since 777 first struck a deal with Everton's majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri.

The group has been bankrolling the club since then via a series of multi-million-pound loans and Telegraph Sport has been told it is resigned to continuing to do so beyond the end of this month, with a final decision on the takeover not now expected until after Easter.

One reason given was Everton's hearing into an alleged second breach of English football's Profit and Sustainability Rules, which is expected to be held early next week.

Another is that even if the Premier League board approves the 777 takeover, an independent oversight panel of KCs will be called in to review its conclusions.

The precedent set by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's purchase of Manchester United led insiders to conclude that further process alone will take another seven days.

Telegraph Sport has reported previously how 777 appeared unwilling to provide any further loan funding while the takeover saga dragged on.

By the end of this month, it is expected to have handed Everton £200 million to keep the club going.

A gold scheme investment agent was reportedly booked in Navi Mumbai of Maharashtra for allegedly duping a man of Rs 9.15 lakh, a police official said on Saturday, reported the PTI.

According to the PTI, Balamurali Menon was booked for cheating and other offences on the complaint of a man who said he had invested Rs 6 lakh as well as 63 grams of gold worth Rs 3.15 lakh in a scheme recommended by the former, the Kamote police station official said.

""The agent collected the gold and cash from the victim but did not not give them to the jeweller operating the scheme and misappropriated it. Further probe is underway,"" he added, as per the PTI.

Meanwhile, two members of an interstate gang which targeted merchants of the Vashi APMC in Navi Mumbai of Maharashtra have been arrested, a Crime Branch official said on Friday, reported the PTI.

According to the PTI, they used to follow cars of merchants and then steal cash and valuables at an opportune time, Crime Unit II senior inspector Umesh Gawli said.

""They were held on March 19 while moving on a scooter without a number plate. Three of their associates hail from Rajasthan. Items valued at Rs 13.64 lakh were recovered from arrested accused Ajay Chouhan and Rohan Kanjar,"" he said, as per the PTI.

""They have cases against their names in Nhava Sheva, APMC, Sanpada, Panvel, Nerul, Kharghar, Vashi, Dindoshi and Shil-Daighar police stations,"" he added, the news agency reported.

According to a PTI report, fraudsters contacted the man by phone and the Telegram app between February 9 and February 11. The scammers persuaded him to invest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and other digital assets by promising high profits.

Believing the scammers' promises, the Navi Mumbai man transferred Rs 10.61 lakh into numerous accounts as advised.

However, despite his investment, the man did not receive the promised rewards.

In a video interview with TAP news agency, he pointed out that the changes brought about by the new foreign exchange code will mainly concern the form of the text.

The foreign exchange market in Tunisia is governed by the Foreign Exchange Code and Decree No. 608 of 1977 on foreign exchange and foreign trade, in addition to a series of laws and texts published by the Ministry of Finance and the BCT and sent to authorised intermediaries (banks and the Tunisian Post Office), the expert pointed out.

He added that ""the new draft foreign exchange code will replace these texts, which will be merged into a single code, thus avoiding repetition and overlap in certain procedures"".

In terms of content, he noted that the draft law has introduced a fundamental change, especially since the current regulations do not allow the free export of foreign currency, except in two cases.

The first case concerns current operations, which include foreign trade operations, transport, operations linked to capital income and expenses (subject to a ceiling) for stays abroad for tourism, study, health and business purposes.

The second case concerns the actual net proceeds from the sale or liquidation of capital invested by means of foreign currency imports, even if these proceeds exceed the capital initially invested.

The expert pointed out that any other operation is subject to prior authorisation, known as ""general authorisation"", by the Minister of Finance after obtaining the opinion of the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT).

He went on to say that the new law has introduced major changes to this section, as it extends the principle of free export (without authorisation) of foreign currency by residents as part of their investments abroad. This will help to open up new markets (outlets) for Tunisian companies and to internationalise them in order to generate wealth and promote growth.

This new framework will make it possible to stimulate entrepreneurship, improve the business and investment climate, strengthen the competitiveness of companies and help them conquer foreign markets.

Hadidane concluded that whether or not there would be a cap on the amount that could be invested abroad would depend on the final version of the foreign exchange law that the government would submit to the Assembly of People's Representatives (ARP).",tap.info.tn,news,وكالة تونس افريقيا للانباء,,0.0980392156862746,448904655,1,http://www.tap.info.tn/temp/images/660x660/cache_660x660_Analog_medium_17264247_2295644_21032024.JPG,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.",theadvocate.com,news,The Advocate,Associated Press,-0.06666666666666665,448904156,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/1c/d1c759e8-93ba-5951-88f5-6ba45ba6f96e/65fef45151530.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

Announced by Active Travel England today, the £5.5 million investment will help to make travelling on foot, wheeling and cycling, a more attractive option for people making local journeys.

Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, said: ""This investment is a great vote of confidence in our region and will allow us to build on the improvements we've already made.

""We're making it easier for people to get around in a greener, more vibrant West Yorkshire.""

Over half of today's investment (£3 million) will fund six new projects, with communities set to benefit from wider canal towpaths and improved crossing points, as well as improved facilities and infrastructure in Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leeds.

An additional £2.5 million 'Capability Fund' has been awarded to support behaviour change campaigns and network development across all five West Yorkshire districts, over the next 18 months.

Across Yorkshire and the Humber, £12.9 million has been allocated to give people more options to chose to walk, wheel or cycle.

The projects have been designed to benefit all communities. The fund will also support local consultation and local authorities to work closely with residents to ensure new routes are attractive and inclusive for all.

Safety and accessibility are at the heart of the newly funded projects to give even more people the choice to travel by walking, wheeling or cycling.

Giving communities in Yorkshire and the Humber safe and accessible walking and cycling routes eases congestion, reduces air pollution and gives people healthier, cheaper, and more sustainable transport options.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, the £12.9 million funding package is made up of £7.9 million of capital funding from the Active Travel Fund 4 extension, £4.5 million of revenue from the Capability Fund and £500,000 for free e-cycle loans in South Yorkshire.

Across England, £1 million will be allocated to develop walking, wheeling and cycling plans for ten National Parks, including the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District.

In West Yorkshire, new crossings will make the walk to school safer for pupils at Lydgate School in Kirklees.

And a section of the canal towpath between Silsden and Kildwick will be resurfaced to reduce the amount of mud during the winter months and improve safety for people on foot.

Once complete, this will create 47km of continuous towpath, suitable for walking, wheeling and cycling, between Skipton and Leeds with onwards connections to Keighley and Bradford.

National Active Travel Commissioner, Chris Boardman, said: ""This funding will give communities safer and more enjoyable ways to travel to school, work and the shops. It will also help local authorities work with residents to develop plans that work for them.

""This will ensure that communities will reap the most benefits from projects and provide excellent value for money for councils.""

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation. ""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval. A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk. But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning. But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck. ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations."" Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties. The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson cannot take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess. Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort. The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in India this fiscal has seen steady growth in debt investment in sharp contrast to the volatile equity investment, V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",zeebiz.com,news,Zee Business,,-0.08235294117647063,448902597,1,https://cdn.zeebiz.com/sites/default/files/2024/03/23/285295-fpi-4.jpg,

It comes as West Sussex County Council will also receive over £10 million from the Department for Transport to roll out hydrogen powered buses across the region.

Brighton Councillor Trevor Muten said the funding was a ""breakthrough"" for the city, adding: ""This is fantastic news and an example of what we can achieve through partnership. Replacing diesel buses with zero-carbon alternatives will support our shared vision for an accessible, clean and sustainable city.

""Having reliable, accessible, new zero-emission buses will help to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and make Brighton & Hove a successful, healthy and attractive city.""

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and theSenate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall - and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",manilastandard.net,news,Manila Standard,,0.01960784313725483,448902195,1,https://cdn.manilastandard.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/us-senate-us-capitol.jpg,spa-3422544

In their letter, 40 House members and the state's two senators emphasized the need for greater state leadership and continued investment, which they said will bring to California high-paying jobs and large economic growth.

""With the increased cadence in commercial, national security and civil space launch, there is not a better time to position California to be a global leader in the space economy,"" the lawmakers said.

Because the state is already home to several federal space facilities, including the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Los Angeles Air Force Base, NASA facilities like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center as well as a strong satellite manufacturing industry, lawmakers said: ""California is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing space economy.""

California has a rich heritage of spaceflight, said Madhu Thangavelu, a lecturer of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California. The state, instrumental in landing men on the moon in the space race, is home to offices or headquarters of several industry heavyweights, including Boeing, Northrop Grumman, NASA and SpaceX.

""In the past 10 years, we've seen the private space sector take off,"" said Thangavelu, also a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""This happened the most in Southern California, to be specific.""

""No other state could compete with California because of our heritage,"" he said. ""There's a whole culture around human spaceflight that exists in all of California.""

Since 2019, California has invested $625 million in more than 25 counties in the defense and space industry through various programs, said Newsom spokesperson Omar Rodriguez, including those that offer tax credits to businesses based in the state.

Some examples are California Competes, an income tax credit available to businesses that want to come to California or stay in the state; the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority, which offers a tax exclusion to manufacturers of products that reduce pollution and energy use; and the Employment Training Panel, a workforce training program that provides financial assistance to California businesses, said Rodriguez.

In 2022, California launched the California Space Industry Task Force, aimed at pursuing opportunities to ""harness future growth in the space industry,"" according to Newsom's office, through efforts like expanding aerospace research and working with universities to strengthen their career pipeline into the industry.

The task force convenes government and industry leaders regularly to strengthen commercial space industry in the state, said Rhys Williams, Newsom's chief deputy cabinet secretary.

Despite those efforts, said Thangavelu, companies have uprooted their headquarters or parts of their businesses from California, partly due to the state's heavy regulation of public and private companies as well as the high cost of doing business.

In response to the lawmakers, Williams said Newsom is ""committed to expanding the state's role in our nation's space ecosystem.""

""California's innovation is not limited to Earth,"" he said. ""California looks forward to working with state and federal leaders to continue growing and leading the nation's commercial space sector.""

Many of the lawmakers noted that they were motivated by a desire to preserve space industry jobs within their districts and California as a whole.

It was just last month when JPL in Pasadena laid off more than 500 people, about 8% of the lab's total staffing.

At the time, JPL Director Laurie Leshin, in breaking the news to the staff at JPL, wrote, ""These cuts are among the most challenging that we have had to make even as we have sought to reduce our spending in recent months.""

Leshin noted that the lab was waiting on Congress for funding for the much-publicized Mars Sample Return mission -- an effort to retrieve soil and rock samples collected by a Mars rover and return them to Earth for study. But officials were already under the gun to cut costs, leading to a hiring freeze, a reduction in some MSR mission contracts, budget cuts and elimination of some on-site contractors.

She noted that NASA previously told JPL to expect an MSR budget of $300 million, a 63% drop from the previous year.

When Congress passed last-minute funding bills earlier this month, Sen. Alex Padilla noted that the approved funding agreement that ""provides no less than $300 million in funding for the Mars Sample Return Program"" was ""a step in the right direction"" to ensure California's leading position in the industry.

But it didn't take the matter off local leaders' radars across Southern California.

""The issue is of particular importance to the thousands of aerospace jobs here in the San Fernando Valley,"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks. This point was echoed by fellow San Fernando Valley Rep. Tony Cárdenas of Panorama City.

""Seeing the respective successes of Texas and Florida's space ventures, I joined my California delegation colleagues to encourage Gov. Newsom to further expand efforts in our state,"" said Cárdenas. ""We know that California has valuable resources and talent that could outcompete others, so I'm supportive of state investments in our space industrial.""

And Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat who represents a district that has a wealth of private aerospace companies, said Orange County could benefit from increased state support.

""I'm proud to represent a thriving research community, which includes academic researchers at places like (UC Irvine) and local businesses that are building critical systems for the Artemis Space Program,"" she said, pointing to the NASA campaign that aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the moon.

""Orange County is a nationwide leader in driving innovation, and we have consistently benefited from bipartisan federal support,"" said Porter. ""Our community also needs partners at the state level, who will invest in our growing space economy to promote scientific advances and create jobs.""

A similar group of bipartisan lawmakers -- including Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank; Mike Garcia, R-Santa Clarita; and Judy Chu, D-Pasadena -- recently urged NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to commit at least $650 million to the Mars Sample Return Program.

Chu, along with Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican, have also restarted the Congressional Planetary Science Caucus, which works to advance planetary science missions. The Planetary Society is a founding partner of the caucus.

In the letter to Nelson, signed by 23 representatives from California, they asked NASA to invest in the program to retain its workforce and ensure America remains the world leader in the race to Mars.

""If NASA continues to put forward insufficient funding necessitating any further reductions in staff downstream and unnecessary delays to the mission, it risks compromising our national leadership with respect to solar system exploration,"" they said.",ocregister.com,news,The Orange County Register,"Ryan Carter, Hanna Kang, Clara Harter",0.1843137254901961,448902054,1,https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OCR-L-CASPACE-0323.jpg?w=640,

(CNN) -- The Senate passed a government funding package early Saturday morning, averting a partial shutdown and ending a lengthy fight that has loomed over both sides of Capitol Hill for months.

The legislation will next be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, which he's expected to do Saturday.

The vote marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

While final passage came after the midnight deadline, the Senate's action effectively prevented any lapse in funding or government function, and the federal government is now funded through the end of the fiscal year.

The Senate's vote comes after the end of a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill, highlighting how narrow the majorities are in both chambers are and how high tensions are running among lawmakers. Immediately after the House voted to pass the legislation the Senate is considering, firebrand Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to oust Johnson from the speakership. While the resolution does not need to be addressed immediately, it represents the most formal and strident challenge to the speaker's leadership since he took over in late last year. The final House vote was 286-134, with 112 Republicans and 22 Democrats voting against.

Despite the House voting earlier in the day Friday, voting in the Senate was delayed for hours amid negotiations over an agreement to speed passage in the chamber. Republicans had demanded votes on controversial amendments that put some vulnerable Senate Democrats in tough political spots.

The funding bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Lawmakers unveiled the $1.2 trillion government funding package just before 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, and the text is more than 1,000 pages long.

Schumer said Thursday that the text for the legislative package came ""in the nick of time,"" with fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown. The Democratic leader added, ""Now Congress must now race to pass this package before government funding runs out this Friday. Once the House acts, the Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday's deadline and avoid a shutdown,"" a reference to how any one senator could slow passage of the bill and launch a partial shutdown.

After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year.

Johnson, who won the gavel after McCarthy's ouster, faces an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight. With the House starting a two-week recess on Friday, Greene's resolution to oust Johnson will hang over the GOP conference as it considers what to do next in the 118th Congress.

Johnson praised the bill early Thursday morning, outlining conservative wins in the package.

""This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,"" Johnson said in a statement.

House members on both sides of the aisle lashed out Thursday over the agreement, with progressives and far-right members criticizing the legislation for different reasons.

GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN he won't be supporting any Republican who votes for the bill and that leadership ""owns the bill,"" describing the bill as a ""failure.""

""I would have a very difficult time doing that,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju. ""The Republican conference is a failure if they pass this bill.""

House progressives have also been critical with some indicating they will vote against it over provisions that will withhold funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for one year amid the alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack against Israel.

McCarthy's fate has raised questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership, but many Republicans have made clear they do not want another speaker's race after the intense infighting and chaos triggered by McCarthy's removal.

WASHINGTON -- After a day of total procedural hijinks, the Senate passed the government funding bills in the early morning hours of Saturday, having struck an eleventh-hour amendment agreement to allow expedited passage of the bill.

The $1.2 trillion government funding bill will now be sent to President Biden's desk as the late night drama on Capitol Hill caps a turbulent process featuring a year of haggling, six months of stopgaps and intense partisan clashes over money and policy.

Majority Leader Schumer announced the agreement on the floor early Saturday morning.

""It's been a very long and difficult day but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government. It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal it wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the American people that we have reached an agreement to fund the government tonight.""

President Joe Biden will sign the legislation on Saturday, the White House added.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said.

The bills passed in a House 286-134 vote earlier Friday afternoon, despite pushback from far-right members of the Republican caucus. More Democrats backed the bill than Republicans as more than 100 GOP lawmakers voted against it.

The $1.2 trillion package -- considered a major bipartisan effort in the highly divided House -- provides funding for six bills including Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor and Health and Human Services and Education, Legislative Branch and State and Foreign Operations.

If the package is passed by both chambers, the government will be funded through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. It will also put an end to the continuing resolution cycle that has led to Congress nearly shutting the government down, at least partially, five times since October.

The government funding package was introduced in the House under suspension of the rules, which required a two-thirds majority vote for passage. That meant, yet again, House Speaker Mike Johnson needed to rely on Democrats to get the bills across the finish line -- a move that landed his predecessor Kevin McCarthy in hot water and led to his ouster as speaker last year.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., took to the floor during an hour of debate to urge lawmakers to vote yes.

Voting continued after the midnight funding deadline and will now go to President Joe Biden's desk for a signature to avert a government shutdown.

In the wake of the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, hailed the successful passage of the bill as a significant achievement amid the bitterly polarized political atmosphere in Washington, D.C.

""It's no small feat to get a package like this done in divided government,"" Schumer said. ""These past few months have shown yet again that when bipartisanship has room to work we can get the job done.""

All Democrats in the Senate voted in favor of the funding bill, except Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and frequently votes in line with the party, also voted against the bill. Independents Angus King of Maine and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona voted in favor of the bill. Republicans Mike Braun of Indiana and Rick Scott of Florida did not vote.

The list of Republican who crossed the aisle to join the majority of their Democratic colleagues is as follows: John Boozman of Arkansas, Katie Britt of Alabama, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, John Thune of South Dakota, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Todd Young of Indiana.

Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Saturday morning for comment.

Republicans and Democrats were at odds over the size of the budget, with conservatives pushing for spending cuts to reduce the national debt, while progressives sought increased spending on social programs and climate change initiatives.

In the wake of the bill's passage in the House, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, filed a motion to oust GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.

The League wrote the letter last Monday after more than six months of scrutinizing the Miami-based firm's takeover plans and said it ""is currently minded"" to back the offer, subject to conditions. The League has been seeking commitments on funding the club and financing construction of a new stadium. It is not clear whether the League has added additional conditions.

The conditional approval doesn't mean the multiclub-owner 777 is guaranteed approval, one of the people said.

The board consists of League Chief Executive Officer Richard Masters, as well as Chair Alison Brittain and board member Mai Fyfield, among others. Representatives for 777 and Everton declined to comment.

In September, 777 said that it had agreed to buy 94.1% of the club from owner Farhad Moshiri. Since then, it has faced questions from the League over its suitability to own the historic Liverpool team.

Acquiring Everton would give 777, co-led by Steven Pasko and Josh Wander, ownership of one of the most storied clubs in England. 777, whose clubs include Hertha Berlin and Standard Lieige, is one of a growing number of multiclub owners in world football but it has also attracted scrutiny over its financial practices.

Since September, 777 has injected more than £150 million ($189 million) into Everton to cover working capital requirements and allow construction of a nearly 53,000-seat stadium in Liverpool's Bramley docks.

Founded in 1878, the team has played continuously in the country's top tier since the early 1950s but it hasn't won a trophy since 1995. In recent years, the team has flirted with relegation and struggled financially off the pitch.

777 has appointed the sports investment group Tifosy to help it raise funding. In its prospectus to potential investors, called Project Teaser, it says the Everton acquisition would give the group access to the worlds largest and most-profitable League, which is also the most followed on social media.

Several Premier League clubs, including Arsenal FC, Liverpool and Chelsea, are owned by American-led investor groups. More than a third of England's professional clubs are now led by Americans.

The team's on-field fortunes this season have been hit by a 10 points deduction, later reduced to 6 points, for breaching the league's spending rules. The points penalty was reduced after the club appealed.

""We had no option but to appeal what we felt was an unjustified points reduction,"" said interim chief executive Colin Chong on the club's website.

The club is still facing a charge for allegedly breaking spending rules last season, which might lead to a further points reduction. The team, impacted already by the 6 point deduction, is hovering close to the relegation zone, which could result in it playing next season in the tier below the lucrative Premier League.",fortune.com,news,Fortune,,0.1686274509803922,448900723,1,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2064459359.jpg?resize=1200,600",eng-9420024

Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said. The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added. (Also Read: India Extends Ban On Onion Exports Indefinitely Ahead Of General Election)

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",zeenews.india.com,news,Zee News,,-0.08235294117647063,448900047,1,https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/03/23/1381102-untitled-design-2024-03-23t194123.386.jpg,eng-9420238

In a statement, the UK Government confirmed that Le Pub was one of 80 ""community assets"" saved from closing by the funding announced.

Landry feels hopeful after some recent news. Representatives from the National Park Service and Louisiana Office of Historic Preservation visited downtown. They were looking at projects that want to get historic tax credits. These $100 million investment credits are a big deal because they make it easier for buildings downtown to get fixed up.

When inflation is up, things like groceries, clothing, cars, and homes cost more. The money you earn and save has less purchasing power, because you're spending more on the same things.

What's a consumer to do? One way to reduce the adverse effects of inflation on your wallet is by investing in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS.

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, abbreviated TIPS, are debt instruments issued by the U.S. Treasury. They are similar to other treasury bonds. They pay a fixed interest rate on a semi-annual basis. You can purchase TIPS with maturity dates from 5 to 30 years. During that time, you get the semi-annual interest payments and the principal back at maturity.

How Do TIPS Protect Against Inflation?

The U.S. Treasury adjusts the par value of TIPS each year, based on inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. Other treasury bonds have a fixed par value, which can be eroded by inflation over time.

This means that the interest payments are also adjusted for inflation each year. The interest rate remains constant, but the rate is applied to the higher par value each year, resulting in a higher interest payment.

Taxation of TIPS

Like other treasury bonds, TIPS are subject to federal income taxes but are exempt from state and local taxes. However, adjusting the par value of TIPS represents a unique tax scenario. When the par value is increased due to an inflation adjustment, the gain is reportable income in the year of the increase. Investors don't receive the higher par value until the bond matures. This means you'll be taxed on the increase in par value before you get it back at maturity, so it's best to plan ahead for this tax consequence.

TIPS are low-risk investments that act as an inflation hedge, making them a good choice for risk-averse investors looking for income protected against inflation.

City officials said the demolitions were made possible through grant funding from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) and their Dilapidated Properties Program (DLAP).

DLAP was created by the WVDEP in 2021 through Senate Bill 368. It's goal was to allocate $30 million statewide to address the challenges posed by dilapidated properties.

In September 2022, Governor Jim Justice and WVDEP announced $9.2 million in grant funding. A few months prior to that, Elkins received a substantial grant of $300,000 to help address their dilapidated and more hazardous structures.

Elkins Mayor Jerry Marco said this is significant for the city.

""The DLAP grant funding has unlocked new potential for improving our city,"" said Marco. ""Removing these structures not only enhances safety but also encourages economic development and revitalizes our neighborhoods.""

The structures in question showed severe deterioration and posed as a health and safety threat to the city.

Jessie Wagler, Code Enforcement Officer for the City of Elkins, is pleased with what the project has done for Elkins and the partnership they have with WVDEP.

""This grant not only helped revitalize the community, but it also helped ease the financial strain on many individuals and businesses during these trying times,"" said Wagler.

Try This: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)

What's a consumer to do? One way to reduce the adverse effects of inflation on your wallet is by investing in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS.

Here's what you need to know.

Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.

What Are TIPS?

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, abbreviated TIPS, are debt instruments issued by the U.S. Treasury. They are similar to other treasury bonds. They pay a fixed interest rate on a semi-annual basis. You can purchase TIPS with maturity dates from 5 to 30 years. During that time, you get the semi-annual interest payments and the principal back at maturity.

How Do TIPS Protect Against Inflation?

The U.S. Treasury adjusts the par value of TIPS each year, based on inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. Other treasury bonds have a fixed par value, which can be eroded by inflation over time.

This means that the interest payments are also adjusted for inflation each year. The interest rate remains constant, but the rate is applied to the higher par value each year, resulting in a higher interest payment.

Taxation of TIPS

Like other treasury bonds, TIPS are subject to federal income taxes but are exempt from state and local taxes. However, adjusting the par value of TIPS represents a unique tax scenario. When the par value is increased due to an inflation adjustment, the gain is reportable income in the year of the increase. Investors don't receive the higher par value until the bond matures. This means you'll be taxed on the increase in par value before you get it back at maturity, so it's best to plan ahead for this tax consequence.

TIPS are low-risk investments that act as an inflation hedge, making them a good choice for risk-averse investors looking for income protected against inflation.

When prepared properly for tenancy, when run appropriately and when there are enforceable rules and regulations, you can expect excellent return on your investment. In Lake County, multi-family properties are still affordable, and many are situated on commercial property that is bound to show improved land value in the future.

When considering where to place your commercial property investment dollars, you would be smart to consider this choice which, under scrutiny, shows more upside than down! Facilitating that ""upside,"" however, means taking a long hard look at the responsibilities and disciplines necessary to produce investment success in this venue. Some critical considerations -- if you are exploring multi-family unit properties -- have to do with the uniqueness of long-term management specifically appropriate to the end users: families!

You may plan to operate your multi-family commercial facility yourself, or you may want to hire and develop an experienced on-site management team. In either circumstance, it is important to have structure, enforceable rules and regulations, an understanding of typical multi-family facility challenges and a commitment to the maintenance of a quality environment.

When viewing and considering multi-family investment possibilities, you will no doubt encounter a wide range of existing circumstances. There are properties available that would require anything from complete renovation, just cleanup and repair, radical changes in tenancy all the way to excellently maintained and operated facilities. Be sure you consider just how much preliminary work you want to take on before you can see that red line turn black.

It's easy to see that the key to success in this venue lies in some pretty basic values! A clean, well-maintained place for families to live will attract and retain tenants who will do their part to keep their living environment desirable. If the Rules and Regulations you develop are not enforceable (or if you find it difficult to do the enforcing!) deterioration can be just a matter of time.

Sometimes it's smarter to consider a facility that is older and tired, but has excellent potential because of its location, its neighbors or near-by area development. In such a situation, you would have to be prepared and willing to take on everything from construction issues to possible tenant evictions and later re-tenanting. Such a situation is one that promises future benefits, but significant near-time preparatory work.

There's a wide variety of multi-family unit facilities. Investors see definite distinctions. For instance, the difference between ""mobile home parks"" with semi-permanent residents compared to ""RV parks"" with in-and-out residents. They have similarities as well as definite differences when it comes to maintenance: a basically stable, consistent return (mobile home park tenants); and transient activity (RV's), a bit more tenuous for financial projections.

Whether the multi-family commercial investment property you are considering is permanent structure apartment housing, duplex or triplex homes or mobile unit facilities -- the key to stable tenancy and consistent financial return lies in the quality of the relationships developed, efficient and dependable maintenance, clarity of mutual expectations and enforceable rules and regulations that have consequences.

If this kind of commercial real estate investment appeals to you, it can be rewarding on many levels - financial and personal!",record-bee.com,news,Lake County Record-Bee,Jim Magliulo,0.3254901960784313,448898683,1,https://www.record-bee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/LRB-Filler-PhotoCORRECT-SIZE.png,

At a demand zone

The stock of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance appears to stay in a broad horizontal trend. Since July last year, it has been fluctuating within ₹1,030 and ₹1,275. After seeing a decline in price over the past couple of months, the stock has reached the bottom of the range. A trendline also overlaps at this support. So, the odds for a rally are high from the current level.

In the next few months, the stock is likely to appreciate towards the top of the range at ₹1,275. Therefore, we recommend buying this stock now at ₹1,090. Buy more shares if the price moderates to ₹1,040. Place stop-loss at ₹985 initially. Raise this to ₹1,075 when the price goes above ₹1,175. Book profits at ₹1,250.

DCM Shriram Industries (₹189.4)

Finds support and rebounds

DCM Shriram Industries began its rally in June 2023. But after hitting a record high of ₹228 in February this year, the stock made a U-turn. The share price fell sharply between mid-February and mid-March. However, the price band of ₹160-165 acted as a strong support, arresting the fall. A rising trendline coincides at this price region, making it an important support.

Considering the rebound in price and that the overall trend is bullish, we anticipate the stock to appreciate from here. So, buy DCM Shriram Industries now at ₹190 and on a decline to ₹175. Place initial stop-loss at ₹155. Revise this to ₹185 when the stock rises past ₹200. Tighten the stop-loss further to ₹200 when the stock touches ₹215. Book profits at ₹225.

Karur Vysya Bank (₹182.4)

Signs of a recovery

Karur Vysya Bank's stock has been steadily rallying since June 2022. Nevertheless, in early February 2024, the stock made a reversal and descended. That said, over the last two weeks, the stock seems to be witnessing some buying interest. The last two candlesticks on the weekly chart are bullish. Moreover, the stock has moved back above the 20- and 50-day moving averages. Hence, the probability of a rally is high.

We could see the price hitting ₹200 in the near term. So, traders can go long on Karur Vysya Bank at the current level of ₹182. Accumulate on dips to ₹175. Keep initial stop-loss at ₹165. When the stock surpasses ₹190, tighten the stop-loss to ₹178. Liquidate at ₹200.

On Friday the legislation passed the House with a vote of 286 to 134 and the Senate with a vote of 74 to 24. President Joe Biden has already said he would sign the bill immediately if it was able advance through the two chambers.

Its passage comes amid warnings about a looming famine hitting Gaza. Earlier this week the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) put out a report predicting that northern Gaza could experience one by May. The IPC classifies the region as Phase 5 situation, which is the most catastrophic categorization.

""We're talking about 1.1 million people,"" Andrea De Domenico, head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian territory told ABC News. ""If you compare to other contexts -- at the peak of the famine in Yemen, for example -- we had 150,000 people in Phase 5. Here, we're talking about 1.1 million. So, it's unprecedented.""

UNRWA provides life-saving aid to more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.

In January the State Department announced that it was temporarily pausing additional funding to the agency, after the Israeli government accused twelve of its employees of being involved in the October 7th Hamas attack. Israel has yet to publicly prove any of their claims.

The employees were fired, but last month UNRWA commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini admitted that they had been sacked without proof, saying the agency had implemented a ""reverse due process."" A UN special commission is still investigating the matter.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who was one of just 23 House Democrats to vote against the bill, gave an impassioned floor speech on the issue.

""This is a mass starvation of people, engineered and orchestrated following the killing of another 30,000, 70 percent of whom were women and children killed. There is hardly a single hospital left. And this was all accomplished, much of this accomplished, with US resources and weapons,"" said the congresswoman.

""If you want to know what an unfolding genocide looks like, open your eyes,"" she continued. ""It looks like the forced famine of 1.1 million innocents. It looks like thousands of children eating grass as their bodies consume themselves, while trucks of food are slowed and halted just miles away. It looks like good and decent people who do nothing, or too little, too late.""

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) also gave a House floor speech.""Israeli government has been intentionally starving the Palestinian people"" she said, ""..Members here - all of them - are now going to be contributing to the starvation of Palestinian families.""

""UNRWA is the primary means of distributing desperately-needed assistance in Gaza - so denying funding for UNRWA is tantamount to denying food to starving people and restricting medical supplies to injured civilians,"" said Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement. ""It also means cutting support for services - including schooling and health care - for over a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. I am deeply frustrated and disappointed by this ban on funding UNRWA at a time when the humanitarian support it provides is so desperately needed.""

The bill's passage was denounced by human rights groups and activists.

""Democrats and Republicans used cutting UNRWA funding until 2025 as a bargaining chip the same way they use immigration to approach negotiations,"" tweeted US Campaign for Palestinian Rights Policy Manager Mohammed Khader. ""Each member that votes to advance this bill is allowing Israel to violate U.S. law and supports mass atrocities against Palestinians.""

""It's unsurprising that the GOP is driving forward a ban on funding for UNRWA -- the primary organization providing humanitarian aid to Gazans on the brink of famine -- while the Israeli military massacres and starves Palestinian civilians in Gaza with U.S. financial and diplomatic backing,"" said IfNotNow national spokesperson Eva Borgwardt in a statement. ""And it's unconscionable that so many Democrats are joining them.""

""Instead of banning funding for UNRWA, the US should restore its aid to Gaza and halt weapons transfers to the Israeli military.""

Israeli officials are predictably lauding the move.

""The historic ban on US funding to UNRWA that passed today with overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and can not be part of the solution,"" tweeted Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz. ""UNRWA will not be a part of Gaza's landscape in the aftermath of Hamas. Thousands of UNRWA employees are involved in Hamas terror activities and their facilities were used for terrorist purposes.""",mondoweiss.net,news,Mondoweiss,Michael Arria,-0.08235294117647063,448897771,1,https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/130324_Dair_El-Balah_OSH_3_002.jpg,eng-9412421

Samantha Burrows, director of Housing Services, said the contracts are up with Mission Samoa and funding, at least for the pallet housing program, was never intended to go beyond June 30 - the end of the first-year operations contract.

""They were always only funded through June,"" Burrows said.

In fact, she added, the homeless-to-work program, supported through the city's General Fund, was never supposed to go beyond its first year, either, but extra funds were found to keep the program running for two additional years.

Gene Ahu, director of programming at Mission Samoa, had a different understanding and thought the city was going to continue its financial support. He took it to mean the city was ""cutting"" the program funding.

""We are going to try to find another way to fund it, but if we can't find it, it will put all those people back on the streets,"" Ahu said about the pallet housing program, which currently has 18 residents.

The contract with the city was for $290,000. The city provided $80,000 annually for the homeless-to-work program, which serves about 20 individuals each year.

Ahu said the workforce program provides housing, food and work training to four individuals at a time, then helps find those people jobs and housing. He said it has an 85% success rate.

The city put up the initial funding for the pallet project, and was then reimbursed through the Community Action Partnership JPA, Ahu said. The city did build the laundry facility and provided the operational funding.

Kari Rader, executive director of Community Action North Bay, clarified by saying the message was that the funding ""potentially"" could be lost, but declined to comment further. It operates Healther House, a program for homeless women. It was not immediately clear how many individuals are at risk of being homeless, again.

Burrows said that program is funded through a Covid-era Community Development Block Grant and ends when the funding runs out.

Ahu said he was surprised when he contacted each of the City Council members that none was aware of the funding situation to the homeless programs. Mayor Catherine Moy was not contacted.

The news was delivered during a Zoom meeting Thursday, just two days after the city had red tagged the City Church homeless facilities due to safety concerns.

Burrows said in talking to residents and others at the church, but not a church official, a number of the residents were going to the church's operation in Bakersfield, some to the homes of family or friends in the area, and at least one was placed in permanent supportive housing.

Vice Mayor Pam Bertani said Homeless Services is not the only department feeling a funding pinch; all the city departments are making cuts in light of a $20 million budget deficit.

She said Gassaway has directed the department heads to cut 5%. The goal is to avoid layoffs and to streamline services without losing them completely. Critical services will be the last to be reduced.

""The city right now is facing a tremendous structural deficit,"" Bertani said.

NEW DELHI: Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in India this fiscal has seen steady growth in debt investment in sharp contrast to the volatile equity investment, V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",dtnext.in,news,dtNext.in,,-0.1137254901960785,448897349,1,https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/01/06/792374-fpii.jpg,eng-9420238

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said on Saturday.

This rising trend in debt investment is evident in March too, with inflows of Rs 13,223 crore in debt through March 2022, he said.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",socialnews.xyz,news,Social News XYZ,,-0.1607843137254902,448897132,1,https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23/c14f0ac2b13d45c1c3bc9674c7d488fa.jpg?fit=588%2C355&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1711200662,eng-9420238

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it today.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

The measure covers about 70 percent of discretionary government spending and completes the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process nearly six months after its scheduled conclusion.

After fending off several amendments, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announced an agreement had been reached and the Senate voted 74-24 to approve the measure, hours after the House passed it earlier in the day by a 286-134 margin.

The funding bill now goes to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he will sign it. The 1,000-page legislation contains six separate funding bills that needed to pass by the looming Friday-night deadline in order to avoid a government shutdown.

""We have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government tonight,"" Schumer wrote on the social media platform X. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it. It is good for the American people that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The majority leader praised the effort for containing ""significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more.

""Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk,"" he said.

If the bill had been amended in the Senate, it would would have needed to go back to the House for approval, but with the House adjourned for two weeks, such a measure would have guaranteed a government shutdown.

Earlier Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was hopeful the Senate would pass the funding measure without killer amendments.

""This is about -- this is not about this President,"" she said. ""It's not about the White House. It's about the American people. We've always said that. This is about programs that American families need.""

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

The package will keep the doors open to three-fourths of the government, including the departments of Education, Homeland Security, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and State.

""I'm delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on the floor.

The package would give a boost to funding border protections that had long been supported by Republicans. Democrats were able to score a $1 billion increase in childcare and Head Start funding.

Tucked away in the 959-page bill was a line that appropriated $200 million for the General Services Administration to build a new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, Maryland. The new funding outraged some House Republicans, who have accused the bureau of political bias.

""The $1.2 trillion, 1000-page swamp-bus released in the dead of night includes $200 MILLION for a new FBI Headquarters So much for those 'cuts' to FBI,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on X.

The FBI funds were included in a list of ""sellouts and failures"" contained in the spending package posted by Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.

SENATE PASSES MAMMOTH $1.2T SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER BRIEF PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Republicans hold a long list of grievances against the FBI including the investigations into former President Trump, an anti-Catholic memo that identified traditional Catholics as potential ""terrorists,"" and activities during the pandemic to flag so-called misinformation on social media.

The FBI has contested GOP allegations and maintained its law enforcement operations are not influenced by politics. But the bureau's denials have not quieted its critics.

""The FBI labels parents as domestic terrorists, targets pro-lifers, and wages a war against conservative Americans. Their punishment? $200 MILLION for a new headquarters in this 'minbus,'"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo. ""Vote NO.""

HOUSE PASSES $1.2 TRILLION GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

In November, the Biden administration announced Greenbelt, a Washington, D.C., suburb, as the home for a new FBI facility to replace the crumbling J. Edgar Hoover Building, which is blocks away from the White House.

The GSA, which manages the government's real estate portfolio, said that Greenbelt site about 13 miles northeast of Washington was the cheapest one with the best access to public transit.

Lawmakers approved $375 million for the headquarters project in a government funding bill last year. Rep Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., had put forward an amendment to strip that funding from the fiscal 2023 bill, but was unsuccessful.

RUBIO SAYS BEING TRUMP RUNNING MATE WOULD BE 'INCREDIBLE HONOR'

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., welcomed the additional $200 million for the FBI in a statement Thursday, calling the new building in Prince George's County one of his ""top priorities.""

""This funding that I worked to secure within our FSGG appropriations bill is another critical step in moving forward with the new headquarters in Greenbelt,"" said Van Hollen, chairman of the Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee, in a statement to Roll Call.

If the bill had been amended in the Senate, it would would have needed to go back to the House for approval, but with the House adjourned for two weeks, such a measure would have guaranteed a government shutdown.

Earlier Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was hopeful the Senate would pass the funding measure without killer amendments.

""This is about -- this is not about this President,"" she said. ""It's not about the White House. It's about the American people. We've always said that. This is about programs that American families need.""

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

The package will keep the doors open to three-fourths of the government, including the departments of Education, Homeland Security, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and State.

""I'm delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on the floor.

The package would give a boost to funding border protections that had long been supported by Republicans. Democrats were able to score a $1 billion increase in childcare and Head Start funding.

The fundamental reason for this sustained FPI flows into debt is the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Fund and the Bloomberg Bond Index, which is expected to bring investment of around $25 billion.

This investment will begin only by June 2024 and, therefore, FPIs are doing some front-running given this potential investment, Vijayakumar added.

FPI inflows into debt are likely to continue going forward. However, a sharp surge in debt flows is unlikely since the US bond yields have also risen in recent days, and if the differential between developed market bond yields, particularly US bonds, and Indian bond yields decline, the debt inflows will moderate, he added.",weeklyvoice.com,news,Weekly Voice,,-0.1843137254901961,448896467,1,https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/c14f0ac2b13d45c1c3bc9674c7d488fa-2.png,

The legislation now goes to President Biden to sign.

The package, approved on a vote of 74-24, funds the federal government until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

""It has been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Friday night before the vote. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

Minutes after the clock struck midnight -- the deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown -- the White House weighed in.

""[The Office of Management and Budget] has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement given to the press pool. ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

The funding package includes defense, homeland security, financial services and general government, labor-HHS, the legislative branch, and state-foreign operations. The bills needed two-thirds support in the House and was approved on a vote of 286-134.

The Friday House vote could have consequences for Speaker Mike Johnson. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to remove him as Speaker.

There were warning signs Thursday night that the vote may be tighter than GOP leadership expected.

Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., who chairs the Labor-HHS subcommittee, said he'd be voting against the package because of earmarks senators on both sides of the aisle inserted into the bill.

""This is not the bill that my subcommittee produced and supported. The Senate has taken liberties with their Congressionally Directed Spending requests that would never stand in the House,"" he said in a statement.

Republican members also expressed disappointment that the package didn't go further on strengthening the Southern border and criticized the narrow timeframe between the 1000+ page text'srelease early Thursday morning and the Friday vote.

But Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on defense, urged his colleagues to vote for the package.

""Every member must understand the impact of not passing this package. The only other option will be a full year continuing resolution, which will devastate our national security and put our country at risk,"" he said ahead of the House vote. ""A no vote is a vote for China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Hamas.""

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, and education, said the package represents a compromise.

""This legislation does not have everything either side may have wanted,"" she said. ""But I am satisfied that many of the extreme cuts and the policies proposed by House Republicans were rejected.""

She noted her work with other House and Senate Appropriators -- Rep. Kay Granger of Texas and Sens. Collins of Maine and Murray of Washington ""marks the first time negotiations on government funding have been led on all four corners by women.""

The package has wins for both Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans are touting an increase in the number of ICE detention beds and border agents and cutting funding to NGOs. They're also trumpeting a provision that prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from banning gas stoves and another that prevents diplomatic facilities from flying flags that aren't official U.S. flags.

Democrats are praising a $1 billion increase for childcare and early learning programs, including $12 billion for the Head Start program.

Another provision getting a lot of attention is the measure that halts funding for UNWRA, the United Nations Agency that provides aid to Palestinians, until March of 2025. This comes after Israel alleged that a dozen UNWRA staffers took part in Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.

Under House rules, it only takes one lawmaker to bring up a vote to oust the speaker. Greene's motion to remove Johnson, months after House Republicans ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is not privileged, meaning it's unclear if or when it will be brought to the floor for a vote.

Johnson presides over a razor thin, one-vote majority, with Colorado GOP Rep. Ken Buck resigning from the House on Friday and Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher announcing Friday he's resigning effective April 19.

Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., told reporters ahead of the vote that he blames Johnson for bringing the package to the floor for a vote in the first place. He said he didn't want to talk about personnel issues within GOP leadership, but said he ""can't defend the speaker.""

It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight

WASHINGTON | The Senate passed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills in the early morning hours Saturday, a long overdue action nearly six months into the budget year that will push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

In ""The Effect of Centrally Bargained Wages on Firm Growth"", the author studies how firms adjust their hiring and investments in response to higher collectively bargained wage increases. Firms absorb labor cost shocks by increasing sales growth. This is accomplished through increased hiring and capital deepening. In addition, firms change their labor mix towards more skilled workers. ""Financing Constraints and Insurance Demand in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises"" examines how better access to external finance affects the demand for insurance. The authors find that firms with better access invest more and reduce their insurance demand. ""Non-Business Risks and Firm Growth"" explores how firms recover after being hit by an insured loss to their physical assets. On average firms re-invest, however, they still suffer a loss in output driven by a reduction in employment. These results are stronger for firms that have worse access to external capital, which suggests that insurance is not perfect. In ""The Effect of Financial Constraints on Inventory Holdings"", the author studies how financing constraints affect firms' optimal choice of inventory holdings. Tighter financing constraints affect total inventories, but do not affect the ratio of inventories to assets. Thus, optimal inventory policy seems to be based on operational rather than financial concerns.

The measure covers about 70 percent of discretionary government spending and completes the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process nearly six months after its scheduled conclusion.

After fending off several amendments, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announced an agreement had been reached and the Senate voted 74-24 to approve the measure, hours after the House passed it earlier in the day by a 286-134 margin.

The funding bill now goes to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he will sign it. The 1,000-page legislation contains six separate funding bills that needed to pass by the looming Friday-night deadline in order to avoid a government shutdown.

""We have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government tonight,"" Schumer wrote on the social media platform X. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it. It is good for the American people that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The majority leader praised the effort for containing ""significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more.

""Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk,"" he said.

If the bill had been amended in the Senate, it would would have needed to go back to the House for approval, but with the House adjourned for two weeks, such a measure would have guaranteed a government shutdown.

Earlier Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was hopeful the Senate would pass the funding measure without killer amendments.

""This is about -- this is not about this President,"" she said. ""It's not about the White House. It's about the American people. We've always said that. This is about programs that American families need.""

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

The package will keep the doors open to three-fourths of the government, including the departments of Education, Homeland Security, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and State.

""I'm delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on the floor.

The package would give a boost to funding border protections that had long been supported by Republicans. Democrats were able to score a $1 billion increase in childcare and Head Start funding.

As an influencer in financial matters, it's imperative to spotlight ground-breaking solutions that redefine traditional paradigms and empower investors to achieve their financial goals with confidence.

The Pursuit of Financial Prosperity

Investing isn't just about allocating capital - it's about crafting a roadmap to financial prosperity. Whether individuals seek to build wealth for retirement, fund their children's education, or simply secure a brighter future, the underlying objective remains consistent: to generate returns that outpace inflation and preserve purchasing power over time.

Navigating the Investment Landscape: Challenges and Risks

In today's diverse investment landscape, individuals are inundated with a plethora of options, each accompanied by its own set of risks and rewards. While traditional avenues such as gold, bank deposits, stocks, and mutual funds offer familiarity, they also expose investors to market volatility, inflation erosion, and unpredictable returns -- a conundrum that demands a fresh perspective.

Introducing Growth Partner: Revolutionizing Investment Strategy

Amidst the turbulence of traditional investment avenues, Growth Partner emerges as a beacon of stability and growth, redefining the investment landscape with its innovative approach. Here are the key highlights that set Growth Partner apart:

Enhanced Returns with Half the Investment

Growth Partner flips the script on traditional investment models by allowing investors to start earning rental income equivalent to 100% of their investment, despite committing only 50% upfront. This unique proposition accelerates returns and maximizes cash flow from day one.

Assured Returns, Shielded from Market Volatility

Unlike conventional investments susceptible to market fluctuations, Growth Partner offers investors the assurance of a minimum return or actual, whichever is higher. This invaluable guarantee shields investors from the pitfalls of market volatility, ensuring stability and consistent income streams.

Safe Haven in Prime Mumbai Locations

Investing in property, particularly in Mumbai -- the epicenter of India's real estate market -- embodies a globally recognized safe haven. With unmatched demand and enduring value, Mumbai offers investors a secure foundation for capital appreciation and long-term wealth creation.

Diversification Beyond Borders

Embracing a global outlook, Growth Partner unlocks access to diversified investment opportunities across real estate markets worldwide. By mitigating geographic and sectoral risks inherent in traditional portfolios, Growth Partner empowers investors to broaden their horizons and seize new growth avenues.

Consistent Income Streams

In contrast to the unpredictable nature of stock dividends and mutual fund distributions, Growth Partner provides investors with the assurance of consistent monthly passive income. This dependable revenue stream not only fosters financial stability but also affords investors peace of mind in an ever-changing economic landscape.

How it works?

With just investing 50% of the floor cost, an investor becomes the partner of the developer to own an entire floor of the project which is about to commence the construction. The investor begins to earn 100% of the rental income generated from that floor starting from the following month. This cycle continues for 30 months, basically a period from before the foundation phase and an investor exits when the RCC of the building is done . As we know the rates of the property are lowest at the starting phase and highest at RCC stage. Therefore, exiting at this stage with a Profit sharing of 50:50 becomes beneficial for an Investor. This Revolutionary Retail Property Investment Plan is the Innovation of Mr. Siddharth Bosmiya, 2nd Generation of Ghar Ho To Aisa.

There is a common perception that real estate investments do not give significant returns, CA Sarthak Ahuja in a recent reel highlighted - ""The No. 1 Investment in the Market is Real ESTATE"". There are many now who are turning to real estate as a viable investing option. The Growth Partner initiative by Ghar Ho To Aisa elevates investment opportunities in the real estate sector to greater heights.

Conclusion: Embracing a New Era of Financial Empowerment

As influencers in financial matters, it's our responsibility to champion forward-thinking solutions that resonate with today's investors. With its unwavering commitment to stability, growth and investor empowerment, Growth Partner stands as a testament to the transformative potential of innovative investment strategies. By embracing Growth Partner, investors can embark on a journey towards financial prosperity with confidence, paving the way for a brighter future filled with endless possibilities.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS), released the below statement regarding legislation passed by the Senate containing bill text for remaining six Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) appropriations bills, fully funding the government.

""I wish we could have had an appropriations process that was open for floor discussion on each separate bill, including amendments, and free of shutdown drama. Unfortunately, that is not what Leader Schumer prefers,"" Senator Capito said. ""Regardless, after negotiation and compromise, I am pleased that so many West Virginia priorities I have fought for were addressed in these bills -- particularly in the Labor-HHS bill, which I helped author. This six-bill package includes important resources that increase pay for our troops and strengthen our national defense and the relationships with our global allies, in addition to the practical impacts to West Virginians. These bills help fight the opioid epidemic, improve our healthcare facilities and workforce, and strengthen economic development initiatives. I'm proud that as a leader on the Appropriations Committee, I had a hand in drafting these bills.""

Club chairman Tom Jamieson said: ""This is fantastic news following all of the hard work behind the scenes over the past 4 years as we have been striving to ensure the community of Rhyl secures Belle Vue indefinitely.

""I want to personally thank Adam Roche for all of his hard work and tireless efforts on securing the funding and whilst there is still some way to go this a huge step for us in achieving our goal.

""I would like to also thank our local representatives from both UK Government, Welsh Assembly and local council.""

Shadow Minister for North Wales, and Clwyd West MS, Darren Millar has also welcomed the news of the funding through the Government's Community Ownership Fund (COF).

The government is providing £150 million over four years to support community groups in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to take ownership of assets and amenities at risk of being lost.

Voluntary and community groups can bid for funding to acquire important assets and run them for the benefit of the local community.

CPD Y Rhyl 1879 (Rhyl FC 1879) submitted a bid in Round 3, and Mr Millar is delighted to hear that it has been successful.

The funding will be used to purchase and secure the future of the Belle Vue football ground, enabling the group to move to a seven days a week community use operation.

He said: ""I am thrilled that CPD Y Rhyl 1879 (Rhyl FC 1879) have been successful with their application. They have faced a challenging few years, but this funding will save them from the risk of eviction and enable them to expand the services they provide including education and footballing activities, a community social enterprise, out of school term camps, disabled access, and a function room.

""The future of the club was left in severe doubt in 2020 when it announced it was winding up proceedings due to funding difficulties, but fortunately a new 'phoenix' football club was established in the town.

""I would like to thank all those who have fought so hard to secure the future of this club, including Vale of Clwyd MP Dr James Davies who I know has repeatedly raised the club's plight with Ministers and called for support in Parliament.

""Belle Vue is a historic landmark in Rhyl and there will be much celebration in the town today in light of this funding announcement.""

Dr James Davies, Vale of Clwyd MP, said: ""Having worked closely with CPD Y Rhyl (Rhyl FC) through what has been a challenging few years for the club, I am thrilled that their funding bid has been successful.

Evaluating the potential of different hydrocarbon-potential areas needs more comprehensive scientific evaluation models. This study aims to establish a Comprehensive Investment Potential of Petroleum (CIPP) framework for targeted sedimentary basins by using an integrated approach that combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Entropy-Weighted Fuzzy TOPSIS models. We focus particularly on representative African basins to inform strategic decision-making for the Chinese overseas petroleum enterprises. We firstly interpret the geological condition of these petroleum basins by researching multiple databases and proprietary research data. Then, we use a combined approach of ranking-classification-correlation analysis to evaluate 17 representative basins, taking into account both overall and individual key performance indicators. Our findings suggest the Illizi Basin and the Offshore Côte d'Ivoire Basin could be the most favorable for investment and development. Those like Southwest African Basin warrant cautious consideration. The new evaluation model and computational workflow offer an effective workflow for assessing multiple petroleum basins. This work provides not just practical investment strategies for companies aiming for African petroleum basins, but also a transferable methodology for optimizing investment decisions.

As the role of petroleum resources grows in the industrial production of China, the demand has also increased over the years. Compensating for domestic petroleum production shortfalls makes international upstream investment and development increasingly imperative. Nevertheless, for Chinese enterprises, this investment arena is fraught with multifaceted challenges of considerable complexity. Affected by various factors such as geography, economics and politics, optimizing investment strategies have become critically important. Specifically in Africa, the abundance of petroleum resources has attracted investments and developmental efforts from various countries and regions, including China and Western nations. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive and scientific methodologies for evaluating the exploration and development potential of various African basins. This absence introduces significant uncertainties for similar investors and policymakers. The lack of targeted research and scientific ranking mechanisms often leads to hesitancy among various capital stakeholders when selecting target basins for expansion.

Previous research focus on the evaluation of petroleum resource utilization and associated investment returns. These studies, using a variety of evaluation methodologies, predominantly concentrate on economic dimensions such as risk investment, price volatility and rates of return on capital. However, very few studies offer classification and ranking for specific regional clusters under investigation.

Some research endeavors provide investment risk assessments tailored for individual countries. There are also commendable studies worth noting that focus on downstream refinery-oriented overseas strategic investment. However, these works rarely adopt an all-sided approach to strategic investment risk evaluation by incorporating factors like petroleum geological conditions, development status and socio-political environment. While some research does consider geological conditions, these studies often exhibit a level of simplification in their indicators and dimensions that is inadequate for comprehensive analysis.

The scarcity of basin-level offshore oil investment evaluations reflects the challenge of accounting for numerous interconnected factors. Compared to assessments at the national level, evaluations at the basin level can take into account more geological conditions related to oil and gas, as these factors are of significant importance. We suggest that, in order to better evaluate the degree of oil and gas investment, replacing the national level with the basin level can highlight the effectiveness of the investment. This approach allows for a greater focus on upstream oil and gas exploration, as the majority of oil and gas reserves remain undeveloped.

Besides, in the realm of upstream petroleum industry investment, some exploratory yet little research has been conducted using various evaluation algorithms within Decision-making Support Systems (DMS). In contrast, evaluative application research in other domains demonstrates a variety of models that exhibit superior evaluation and classification results when dealing with multi-objective scenarios under complex conditions. The integration of subjective and objective judgments, employing complex algorithms such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Entropy methods, in evaluation techniques is extensively applied. In the calculation of assessment indicator weights, we have considered a similar method that combines both subjective and objective factors, thereby enabling a comprehensive consideration of the indicator information of the assessment object in the most scientific manner. This model introduces a new method for assessing the overseas oil resource investment environment at the basin level.

The research gap can be identified in the assessment of the upstream oil investment potential of African basins. On one hand, previous studies or evaluation models lack consideration of the factors of oil resource utilization and seldom involve a comprehensive assessment of oil geological conditions, development status, and socio-political environments. Moreover, there is a lack of an optimized mathematical evaluation model for assessing, classifying and ranking all African oil and gas basins, with multidimensional comparisons both across and within dimensions. This presents significant uncertainty and a lack of a macro perspective for oil and gas investors when selecting target basins in the region.

Therefore, there is requirement for studies that concentrate on choosing oil resources from various geographical areas, as there is a noticeable absence of appropriate assessment frameworks specifically designed for this situation. A comprehensive consideration at the basin level, integrating both subjective and objective factors, allows investment strategies to focus more on the inherent potential of oil and gas reserves. The primary objective of this paper is to innovate upon existing comprehensive and complex evaluation models from other fields to assess the investment potential of targeted petroleum regions. This aims to deepen both the research and understanding of basin selection in the petroleum investment field, offering an advanced yet effective evaluation model as a new perspective for fellow researchers and practitioners. Specifically, this study seeks to refine the selection of representative basins in Africa for potential petroleum investment and development, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for targeted basin clusters. This research can address the research gap by establishing a rational and effective mathematical evaluation model, filling the void of a lack of systematic, multi-level, and multi-dimensional rankings and classification systems for African oil and gas basins that can integrate the attributes of oil and gas resources with economic and social environmental factors.

To achieve this, the study leverages multiple databases and prior research materials to provide an application to evaluate the upstream petroleum investment within African basins: (1) utilize Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to construct a multi-dimensional comprehensive indicator system, (2) use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on expert scoring and the entropy method to balance subjective and objective evaluations, thereby establishing the weights of various indicators, (3) apply an enhanced Entropy-Weighted Fuzzy TOPSIS method for comprehensive ranking and evaluation, (4) classify the evaluation results and (5) include a correlational analysis of internal key performance indicators to further enrich and validate the evaluation results.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.2784313725490195,448895609,1,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-57445-9/MediaObjects/41598_2024_57445_Fig1_HTML.png,

Overreliance on foreign trade has intensified in the past decade, exacerbated by the pandemic's exposure of global supply chain vulnerabilities. Bernstein blames US government policies for undermining the country's independence, with both parties equally neglecting the need to prioritize return-on-investment.

The reindustrialization of America should be the top focus for investors in the coming years, as the country's ""industrial renaissance"" is a matter of utmost importance to economic security, Richard Bernstein Advisors wrote in a note this week.

The trend of American companies shifting away from dependence on foreign labor and supply chains should dominate investment strategies in the coming decades the firm said.

""The market is already rewarding the beneficiaries of this capital reallocation, but we expect years, if not decades, of further performance from this critical investment theme,"" RBA president Richard Bernstein said in a note this week.

""The reindustrialization of America, the American industrial renaissance, the rebuilding of the American capital stock, reshoring, near-shoring, friend-shoring, or infrastructure are all synonymous names for what might be THE most important secular investment theme.""

Deglobalization is a powerful trend that's taken shape since the pandemic, when disruptions to supply chains and global trade stoked runaway inflation for economies around the world. For the US, that means big investment in infrastructure on manufacturing will be needed in the coming years as the world reorients.

""If the US had enough productive capacity to be increasingly economically independent, then contracting globalization wouldn't be an important issue, but that is unfortunately not the case. Rather, the US has become increasingly dependent on the rest of the world for goods and services,"" Bernstein wrote.

""Maintaining a massive trade deficit while globalization is contracting is a toxic combination that is now revealing an underlying structural weakness in the US economy.""

Bernstein says the US government's policies have been a major contributor to hindering the country's economic independence, and both of the dominant political parties are culpable for losing sight of the nation's need to prioritize domestic investment.

""We expect both Democrats and Republicans to finally wake up to their misguided tactics. Democrats will likely argue for spending on longer-lived assets (there is some evidence this may be starting), whereas Republicans might shift to a tax reward system for good behavior (e.g., build a production facility in the US and then receive tax benefits) rather than blanket tax cuts whose benefits can 'leak' abroad,"" he said.

As for specific investments within the broader theme of reindustrialization, the firm said it is focused on energy and utility infrastructure, transportation, real estate, and steel and shipbuilding.

""The market has already recognized the re-industrialization investment theme despite investors' myopia with respect to more exciting technology-related themes, like artificial intelligence. In fact, domestically focused industrial stocks have outperformed the overall market during the past decade.""

A successful bid by South Oxfordshire District Council has secured government funding amounting to £1,490,475.

This funding is intended for the installation of solar panels and air source heat pumps, replacing the gas-fired boilers at The Didcot Wave Leisure Centre and Park Sports Centre, in Wheatley.

The remainder of the required funding, approximately £1,582,570, has been produced jointly by South Oxfordshire District Council and Oxfordshire County Council in order to complete the works by spring 2026.

Councillor Maggie Filipova-Rivers, South Oxfordshire District Council cabinet member for community wellbeing, said: ""This is such good news for the centres and the people who use them.

""The energy bills are expected to reduce as a result of this decarbonisation programme, which means the leisure centres are sustainable both economically and from a climate point of view.""

The new renewable energy measures will help to cut more than 200 tonnes of carbon emissions each year.

This transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy will reduce South Oxfordshire District Council's overall emissions by 6.9 per cent.

Councillor Freddie Van Mierlo, South Oxfordshire District Council cabinet member for climate change and nature recovery, said: ""This is great news for our communities.

""Leisure centres are energy hungry and a major source of the council's carbon emissions.

""This investment is therefore a double win - we are both safeguarding the environment and protecting consumers' and taxpayers' wallets.""

The funding has become available via the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme Phase 3c (PSDS3c).

Managed by Salix Finance on behalf of the government, the PSDS3c is an initiative by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Its goal is to reduce emissions from heating public sector buildings, thereby supporting a green recovery and reinforcing the UK's 2050 net zero target and clean growth aspirations.

Director of programmes at Salix, Ian Rodger said: ""It is very clear that we face huge net zero challenges, and we have no time to waste in addressing our carbon footprint.

""At Salix, we're delighted to be able to work with South Oxfordshire District Council on improving the energy efficiency of such vital community buildings.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70 percent of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24 percent increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

The measure covers about 70 percent of discretionary government spending and completes the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process nearly six months after its scheduled conclusion.

After fending off several amendments, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announced an agreement had been reached and the Senate voted 74-24 to approve the measure, hours after the House passed it earlier in the day by a 286-134 margin.

The funding bill now goes to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he will sign it. The 1,000-page legislation contains six separate funding bills that needed to pass by the looming Friday-night deadline in order to avoid a government shutdown.

""We have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government tonight,"" Schumer wrote on the social media platform X. ""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it. It is good for the American people that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The majority leader praised the effort for containing ""significant investments for parents and kids and small businesses and health care workers and military families and so much more.

""Our efforts have paid off with a strong funding bill that now goes to President Biden's desk,"" he said.

If the bill had been amended in the Senate, it would would have needed to go back to the House for approval, but with the House adjourned for two weeks, such a measure would have guaranteed a government shutdown.

Earlier Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was hopeful the Senate would pass the funding measure without killer amendments.

""This is about -- this is not about this President,"" she said. ""It's not about the White House. It's about the American people. We've always said that. This is about programs that American families need.""

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

The package will keep the doors open to three-fourths of the government, including the departments of Education, Homeland Security, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and State.

""I'm delighted and relieved to be finally closing out fiscal year 2024,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on the floor.

The package would give a boost to funding border protections that had long been supported by Republicans. Democrats were able to score a $1 billion increase in childcare and Head Start funding.

A successful bid by South Oxfordshire District Council has secured government funding amounting to £1,490,475.

This funding is intended for the installation of solar panels and air source heat pumps, replacing the gas-fired boilers at The Didcot Wave Leisure Centre and Park Sports Centre, in Wheatley.

The remainder of the required funding, approximately £1,582,570, has been produced jointly by South Oxfordshire District Council and Oxfordshire County Council in order to complete the works by spring 2026.

Councillor Maggie Filipova-Rivers, South Oxfordshire District Council cabinet member for community wellbeing, said: ""This is such good news for the centres and the people who use them.

""The energy bills are expected to reduce as a result of this decarbonisation programme, which means the leisure centres are sustainable both economically and from a climate point of view.""

The new renewable energy measures will help to cut more than 200 tonnes of carbon emissions each year.

This transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy will reduce South Oxfordshire District Council's overall emissions by 6.9 per cent.

Councillor Freddie Van Mierlo, South Oxfordshire District Council cabinet member for climate change and nature recovery, said: ""This is great news for our communities.

""Leisure centres are energy hungry and a major source of the council's carbon emissions.

""This investment is therefore a double win - we are both safeguarding the environment and protecting consumers' and taxpayers' wallets.""

The funding has become available via the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme Phase 3c (PSDS3c).

Managed by Salix Finance on behalf of the government, the PSDS3c is an initiative by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Its goal is to reduce emissions from heating public sector buildings, thereby supporting a green recovery and reinforcing the UK's 2050 net zero target and clean growth aspirations.

Director of programmes at Salix, Ian Rodger said: ""It is very clear that we face huge net zero challenges, and we have no time to waste in addressing our carbon footprint.

""At Salix, we're delighted to be able to work with South Oxfordshire District Council on improving the energy efficiency of such vital community buildings.

""These leisure centres are a true hub of activity for local people.

""The Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme funding will help not only make these buildings more energy efficient, but they will be better venues to work in and visit.""",oxfordmail.co.uk,news,Oxford Mail,,0.3176470588235294,448895308,1,https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/images/17884359/,

The House began debate on the spending bill at 9 a.m. EDT Friday before voting at 11 a.m., with 101 Republicans joining 184 Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate.

Given the time crunch, the vote was held under suspension of rules, ditching a requirement to first pass a rule that would face Republican opposition but placing a requirement of two-thirds support for the measure to pass.

The legislation passed despite strong criticism from some House conservatives over its spending needs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., filed a motion Friday to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson after his successful bipartisan efforts to advance the budget plan.

The most conservative members of the House complained about Johnson leaning on Democrats to get the funding legislation passed. The majority of House Republicans, 134, voted against the package while 101 voted for it.

Republican conservatives and House progressives had pushed back over a one-year hold in funding for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees over the alleged involvement of some of its workers in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

""On any bipartisan agreement you have some Democrats and some Republicans that drop off,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said prior to the vote.

""Bharat has entered a new chapter in its history, one which is characterised by rapid socio-economic progress and technological advancements, and striving to become a developed nation by 2047 in the Amrit Kaal. Bhutan has the vision to become a high-income nation by 2034 and is embarking on a new phase in its economic development. In the common quest for progress and prosperity, Bharat and Bhutan will continue to be the closest of friends and partners,"" the joint statement added.

PM Modi is currently on a two-day state visit to Bhutan from March 22-23.

Upon his arrival, he received a rousing welcome from the people who turned out in large numbers to accord a warm reception in Bhutan.

Prime Minister Modi was conferred with 'Order of the Druk Gyalpo' Bhutan's highest civilian honour. He became only the first foreign dignitary and fourth person to receive this award.

He called on Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck at the Tashichho Dzong Palace in Thimphu and attended a cultural program at the Tendrelthang Festival Ground in the presence of the Bhutan King.

Talks are on with one of the State-agencies there for securing the blocks.

Acquisitions are most likely going to be through KABIL, yet again.

Recently, the Ministry through its CPSE, KABIL (Khanij Bidesh India Ltd) - a joint venture among NALCO, Hindustan Copper (HCL) and MECL - acquired five lithium blocks in Argentina.

""We are still engaging with Australia and trying to get some lithium blocks there. Australia is one of the largest lithium producers globally and (discussions are on) through one of their government offices"", Critical Minerals Office, VL Kantha Rao, Secretary, Ministry of Mines, told businessline.

Work has also begun towards engaging a consultant there. PWC was the previous consultant.

""Previously, there was a consultant, which was jointly appointed by KABIL and the Australian government, helping us there. However, that did not work out. We are now looking for another consultant and some other blocks"", he said.

""Earlier, in Argentina it was a G2G agreement and that worked well. But, in Australia, that may not be the case. We are going with whatever the law of the land is there,"" Rao added.

In Australia, rules state that if a mineral block (in this case) is shortlisted for acquisition or investment, then the foreign company or government enterprise (in this case from India), will have to pick up an equity stake in the Australian company who owns that particular block. Off-take agreements are decided on the proportion of equity picked up in the Australian company, sources said.

Incidentally, some 52 per cent of the world's lithium comes from Australia.

Lithium is mostly found in the mineral spodumene, from which it must be extracted, processed and refined. In 2023, Australia reported an output of of 86,000 tonnes of lithium, higher than the 74,700 tonnes it reported in 2022.

A key use of lithium is in rechargeable batteries for electronic devices such as cell phones, cameras, laptops and electric vehicles (EVs). It is the last of these applications that has investors most excited and lithium is critical to EV production, as its unique properties help create the lightweight batteries they need to function.

Tapping into Africa

This apart, the Ministry has begun consultation with several counties in Africa - Namibia, Ghana, Congo, Zambia, Tanzania and South Africa - for acquisition of critical mineral blocks.

""In some countries, like Tanzania, we can look at G2G arrangements,"" Rao said.

African nations would be tapped primarily for copper, cobalt, chromite and other critical minerals.

""We have been present in African nations previously in sectors like coal and some of the private players have also invested there. Now, we are trying to push through a government support for critical minerals,"" Rao said.

The Senate cleared the bill in a 74-24 vote. It will now go to President Joe Biden, who's expected to sign it.

The passage came as the government had technically gone into a partial shutdown, though a short-lived one lasting only two hours.

The bill, coming in at over 1,000 pages and $1.2 trillion in spending, rocketed through Congress this week after its introduction around 2:00 a.m. on Thursday. After the bill's passage in the House on March 22, it's progress in the Senate was delayed for several hours due to a disagreement between Republicans and Democrats about the rules for amending the bill.

Earlier on Friday, the House passed the spending bills in a 286-134 vote, with the majority of Republicans voting against the package. Conservatives were left fuming over spending increases in the deal. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed a motion to force a vote to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) meant as a ""warning"" to the speaker.

""It's more of a warning and a pink slip,"" Ms. Greene told reporters, as she does ""not wish to inflict pain on our conference and to throw the House in chaos"" -- as was the case in September when Mr. Johnson's predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), was ousted from the position.

The bill would fund the Departments of State, Defense, Treasury, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.

The Pentagon would get $825 billion -- $27 billion more than in the 2023 fiscal year -- including $92 million more than requested by the Biden administration to improve U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's deterrence amid the threat from China. There is $108 billion allocated for U.S. security cooperation with Taiwan and $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which consists of training, equipment, and other means to aid Ukraine.

However, direct funding for Ukraine and Taiwan is not in the spending bill as Congress is stuck trying to pass a supplemental assistance package for Taipei and Kyiv as Republicans have called for stringent border measures in exchange. The GOP blocked a Senate bill that consisted of assistance for Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, and some specific border security measures.

The annual $3.3 billion for Israel is in the bill, as has been the case for the past several years. This comes amid the latest conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas.

The bill allocates $1.8 billion to the Treasury Department, minus the IRS, which would get $12.3 billion. The appropriation for the IRS would be the same as it was in the 2023 fiscal year.

The appropriations bill also prevents the IRS from transferring more funds from its accounts for enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would get $61.8 billion, a $1.1 billion increase over the 2023 fiscal year. Customs and Border Protection would receive $400 million toward combating the influx of fentanyl, a major problem as the deadly drug crosses the southern border via cartels and other sources.

The bill allocates $2.2 billion for processing asylum seekers and related purposes.

DHS will have 24 percent more beds in detention centers for illegal immigrants and an additional 22,000 Border Patrol agents, as proposed under a tough border security bill previously passed by the GOP-controlled House that was dead in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The funding also covers 41,500 detention beds proposed under the previous House bill.

There will also be 12,000 additional special immigrant visas awarded to Afghan allies who helped the United States during the nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan, from which the United States and its allies hastily withdrew in mid-2021 as the Biden administration came under fire for abandoning those allies who served in numerous roles, such as interpreters.

The Department of Health and Human Services would receive $116.8 billion, a $3.9 billion decrease from the 2023 fiscal year, though the National Institutes of Health would get $48.6 billion this year, $300 million more than last year.

The Education Department would get $79.1 billion, a $500 million decrease from the 2023 fiscal year.

The State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development would get $11.8 billion, a $5.6 billion decrease from the 2023 fiscal year.

This includes $300 million for Taiwan and conditions assistance to Gaza, which Hamas controls.

No funding was allocated through March 2025 for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA has come under fire for what critics call propagating hatred for Jewish people in schools.

Moreover, the bill also includes $200 million for the new FBI headquarters, which will be built just outside Washington in Greenbelt, Maryland -- a contentious issue for Republicans.

Both Democrats and Republicans got policy victories, though some members on both sides are expected to oppose the bill despite the expected overwhelming support it will get in both the House and Senate.

""We're in a bad spot. And it's a bad process, but we're in a bad spot because previously we've done things we ought not to have done. And I believe we need to push back on the Senate,"" Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told The Epoch Times.

""But do we push back on this moment in history? Probably not,"" he continued. ""But we need to be laying the pieces to a future understanding where we have some power to tell the Senate to pound sand.""

Finally, despite Ms. Greene filing a motion to vacate, it does not appear that Mr. Johnson's speakership is in jeopardy, whereas his predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), was stripped of the gavel after pushing through a spending bill.

""If we vacate this speaker, we'll end up with a Democrat speaker,"" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who led the push to oust Mr. McCarthy.

Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.), who was one of the members who voted to oust Mr. McCarthy from the speaker's chair, said he would be against doing the same to Mr. Johnson.

Members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus did not hold back their frustration over the bill.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good (R-Va.) railed against the bill, saying it is worse than the spending when the Democrats controlled Congress under the leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

""It does seem this bill again maintains the Pelosi-Schumer policies and spending levels exactly,"" said Mr. Good. ""It actually increases spending levels by about $60 billion that were in place from the omnibus that we all voted against a year and a half ago, but it has some new things that we want to point out here,"" he said at a press conference.

Mr. Good lamented the earmarks and $200 million for the new FBI headquarters.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) slammed Congressional GOP leadership over the $1.2 trillion government spending bill, calling it a ""swamp glossary"" -- a reference to Washington's nickname, ""the Swamp.""

""Frankly, our Republican leadership or basically walking swamp glossary,"" the Freedom Caucus member said.

He cited what he said are excuses from his party's leadership such as that the GOP majority in the House is thin.

Mr. Roy said that Republicans who vote for the bill, which is expected to overwhelmingly pass the House, are ""risking the election.""

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) called on Mr. Johnson to shut down the House over the $1.2 trillion government spending bill.

He explained that Mr. Johnson could do so by removing a ceremonial ornamented staff called a mace. The mace is in place next to the speaker's chair when the House is in session and it is a 184-year-old custom.

""Take the mace down, cut the lights off, and say we will not come back until you stop the invasion at the border,"" said Mr. Norman, calling for the Democrat-controlled Senate to pass a tough border security bill that the House passed last year.

The agreement, which allowed Senate Republicans to hold a series of politically charged votes on proposed changes, came after hours of haggling that threatened to push the government into a brief partial shutdown over the weekend. Instead, it appeared that the funding lapse, which started at midnight, would last a matter of hours and have no practical effect.

""It's been a very long and difficult day,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in announcing the deal. ""But we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government. It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but our persistence has been worth it.""

The White House said that President Joe Biden would sign the bill on Saturday and that the government had halted shutdown preparations. But the delay underscored the difficulties that have plagued spending negotiations from the beginning, and was a fitting coda to an excruciating set of talks that are on track to fund the government six months behind schedule.

It capped an extraordinary day on Capitol Hill that began with a bipartisan vote to speed the measure through the House, which set off a conservative revolt and prompted one Republican to threaten a bid to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his post.

Earlier Friday, in a 286-134 vote that came down to the wire in the House as leaders scrounged for the two-thirds majority needed for passage, Democrats rallied to provide the support to overcome a furious swell of opposition by conservative Republicans.

Infuriated by the bipartisan spending agreement, the hard right balked, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., began the process of calling for a vote to oust Johnson.

The reindustrialization of America should be the top focus for investors in the coming years, as the country's ""industrial renaissance"" is a matter of utmost importance to economic security, Richard Bernstein Advisors wrote in a note this week.

The trend of American companies shifting away from dependence on foreign labor and supply chains should dominate investment strategies in the coming decades the firm said.

""The market is already rewarding the beneficiaries of this capital reallocation, but we expect years, if not decades, of further performance from this critical investment theme,"" RBA president Richard Bernstein said in a note this week.

""The reindustrialization of America, the American industrial renaissance, the rebuilding of the American capital stock, reshoring, near-shoring, friend-shoring, or infrastructure are all synonymous names for what might be THE most important secular investment theme.""

Deglobalization is a powerful trend that's taken shape since the pandemic, when disruptions to supply chains and global trade stoked runaway inflation for economies around the world. For the US, that means big investment in infrastructure on manufacturing will be needed in the coming years as the world reorients.

""If the US had enough productive capacity to be increasingly economically independent, then contracting globalization wouldn't be an important issue, but that is unfortunately not the case. Rather, the US has become increasingly dependent on the rest of the world for goods and services,"" Bernstein wrote.

""Maintaining a massive trade deficit while globalization is contracting is a toxic combination that is now revealing an underlying structural weakness in the US economy.""

Bernstein says the US government's policies have been a major contributor to hindering the country's economic independence, and both of the dominant political parties are culpable for losing sight of the nation's need to prioritize domestic investment.

""We expect both Democrats and Republicans to finally wake up to their misguided tactics. Democrats will likely argue for spending on longer-lived assets (there is some evidence this may be starting), whereas Republicans might shift to a tax reward system for good behavior (e.g., build a production facility in the US and then receive tax benefits) rather than blanket tax cuts whose benefits can 'leak' abroad,"" he said.

As for specific investments within the broader theme of reindustrialization, the firm said it is focused on energy and utility infrastructure, transportation, real estate, and steel and shipbuilding.

""The market has already recognized the re-industrialization investment theme despite investors' myopia with respect to more exciting technology-related themes, like artificial intelligence. In fact, domestically focused industrial stocks have outperformed the overall market during the past decade.""",markets.businessinsider.com,news,Markets Insider,Yuheng Zhan,0.1294117647058823,448894202,1,https://i.insider.com/65fda8524af076d3cf92beb4?width=1200&format=jpeg,

The financing will provide solar panels on the roof and improved measurements and controls. Installing solar panels at Kempston will deliver long-term cost and energy efficiency savings. This will allow the site to become 36% self-sufficient on the electricity grid, giving the council the opportunity to invest in further energy efficiency technology and potentially battery storage to further decarbonise the site.

Managed by Sport England, the fund will provide a total of €80 million to local authorities in England as a support package for public leisure facilities with swimming pools.

Councilor Sarah Gallagher, Portfolio Holder for Leisure and Culture, said: ""We are delighted to have received this funding for Kempston Pool. The pool is a much-used, much-loved community asset. We recognize what a valued local community this pool is and how important swimming pools are to help our residents be physically active.

""Achieving this funding demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that the borough has a leisure offering that we can all be proud of, and has been secured at a very exciting time for leisure in Bedford Borough. I am confident that Our residents have already noticed an improvement across all our Leisure sites, as we work closely with our new leisure provider - Greenwich Leisure Limited, to improve all our sites.""

Swimming is a great way for people of all ages to maintain an active lifestyle, and offers many benefits for both physical and mental well-being.

Councilor Gallagher added: ""I would encourage residents who have not yet had the opportunity to visit their local leisure venue to do so and see the difference our investment in these facilities has made.

The inauguration held at the School of the Gifted, Gwagwalada.

Hayyo explained that the amount was for new and existing indigent students in different schools and at different levels of learning.

He said the minister has also resuscitated the school sports festival which was abandoned 25 years ago.

The mandate secretary said the goal is to enhance FCT learning environments and promote excellence.

Hayyo said the FCT is looking to ensure that students and teachers have access to quality facilities.

""It is about laying a foundation for a brighter future for our children,"" Hayyo said.

""We are reaffirming our commitment to ensuring that every child in the FCT has access to quality education; to a safe and stimulating learning environment, where they can grow, thrive and transform into the leaders of tomorrow.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democrat-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Dar es Salaam. Advocates for clean cooking energy have intensified calls for increased financial support from development partners to promote its adoption within communities.

Highlighting the environmental and health hazards associated with traditional cooking fuels like wood and charcoal, they emphasize the urgent need for a transition to cleaner alternatives.

According to ministry of Health statistics from 2017, respiratory diseases attributed to dirty cooking energy claim an estimated 22,000 lives annually in Tanzania.

In response to these challenges, the government has been actively promoting the use of clean cooking energy by distributing gas cylinders, a move spearheaded by the African Women Clean Cooking Energy Project (AWCCSP) launched by President Samia Suluhu Hassan.

""To accelerate such efforts, all stakeholders must collaborate, especially in ensuring affordability and accessibility for target groups,"" said Ms Neema Massawe, the coordinator of Equity Group Foundation Projects.

""There is a need for a special fund to provide loan collateral for individuals and groups transitioning to clean energy.""

Ms Massawe made her remarks during a debate on clean cooking energy organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Tanzania (AmchamTZ) and the World Food Programme (WFP).

She reiterated the necessity of ongoing awareness campaigns, particularly targeting women, to ensure sustainable adoption of clean cooking energy.

Her sentiments were echoed by WFP's head of school programmes, Ms Vera Kwara, who underscored the significance of addressing financial challenges hindering schools from adopting clean cooking energy.

""Due to financial constraints, many schools don't use clean cooking energy,"" Ms Kwara said.

""So, there is a need for development partners and the private sector to consider how to support the availability of clean energy infrastructure.""

Schools, she added, are crucial areas that should receive significant attention since many rely on wood and charcoal.

Chairman of clean energy stakeholders in Tanzania, Mr Finias Magessa, acknowledged the challenge of achieving 100 percent clean energy usage but emphasized the importance of prioritizing cheaper and cleaner alternatives to traditional fuels.

In November 2023, corporate approvals were received to separate the Company's India and GCC businesses into two distinct and standalone entities to unlock long-term value. Under the separation plan, a Fajr Capital-led consortium entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 65% stake in the Company's GCC business. The plan was approved by the Company's shareholders in January 2024.

As a part of the completion process, the Fajr Capital-led consortium has obtained the necessary approvals from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Competition (GAC). All conditions precedent outlined in the SPA are now complete. No-objection certificates as required from key partners and have been received and local and regulatory authorities in GCC have been informed as necessary about the separation of the businesses and the imminent completion of the Transaction. The integration of business operations in Qatar into the Transaction perimeter of Aster DM Healthcare FZC has also been successfully completed.

The Moopen family will continue to lead and operate the GCC business retaining a 35% stake in the buyer entity. Existing shareholders will continue to remain with the listed Indian entity, Aster DM Healthcare Ltd. Upon successful completion of the Transaction, the company intends to declare a substantial portion of the proceeds as dividends to its shareholders, subject to approvals required under law.

In India, the Promoters plan to continue to hold their existing stake in the Company and the separation would provide an opportunity for the Company to expand its institutional investor base. The Company plans to add 1500 beds by FY27 and aims to be among the top 3 hospital chains in India. The expansion plan will encompass a mix of brownfield and greenfield projects, contributing to the company's growth strategy. The Company has planned an outlay of Rs. 850-900 crore which will ensure robust financial support for driving the expansion. This expansion will encompass the upcoming Aster Capital in Trivandrum, featuring 350-plus beds in the first phase by FY26, and Aster MIMS Kasargod with 200-plus beds. Then the Company will be looking at adding bed capacity to the existing hospitals in Medcity, MIMS Kannur by about 100 beds each and Aster Whitefield with 159 beds.

Dr. Azad Moopen, Founder Chairman, Aster DM Healthcare said, ""The separation of Aster's India and GCC businesses will unlock the value and potential of both businesses and provide the needed impetus for the company to further strengthen its presence in both geographies. We are very near to closure and excited to embark on the next stage of growth.""

Commenting on this Alisha Moopen, Managing Director and Group CEO, Aster GCC business said, ""With most of the processes near closure and necessary approvals in place, we are almost at the closure of the transaction and ready to embark on the next stage of our growth journey which would see us expand our presence in Saudi Arabia and further strengthen our footprint in UAE, Oman and Qatar. We are delighted to have Fajr Capital and its consortium partners in our journey and thankful to the authorities for their continued support.""

In GCC, the company has plans to expand its Aster Pharmacy business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 180 retail stores set to open within the next 3-5 years. This would be alongside the expansion of Aster Sanad Hospital in Riyadh with added bed-capacity to serve a larger population segment. In UAE, the company is all set to launch Medcare Royal Hospital, a 126-bed super specialty hospital in Al Qusais, positioned to emerge as the destination for tertiary and quaternary care in a luxury setting, for local and international patients.",apnnews.com,news,apnnews.com,,0.2,448893488,1,https://cdn.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alisha-Moopen-Managing-Director-and-Group-CEO-Aster-GCC-business--scaled.jpg,

STATE COLLEGE -- Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed creating a predictable funding formula and boosting state support by 5% for the state-related universities -- Lincoln University, Penn State University, Temple University, and the University of Pittsburgh.

This new model would tie public funds for the universities to certain metrics, but it is not yet clear what those would be. Taxpayer support for the state-related institutions would also pass through the Pennsylvania Department of Education as grants with a majority vote from the legislature rather than require a two-thirds vote, which is the current model.

In recent years, state House Republicans have delayed funding the schools over political beliefs. Last budget cycle, funding for the universities was not approved until five months after the budget deadline, and passed alongside a separate bill that increased transparency requirements for the schools.

""We need to fix the way we fund our state-relateds -- Pitt, Penn State, and Temple -- along with the nation's oldest degree-granting HBCU, Lincoln University,"" Shapiro said during his February budget address. ""For too long, we've under-funded them and subjected them to political games.""

The proposed performance-based funding model is used by more than half of states across the country, though experts warn such plans can have unintended consequences if not constructed thoughtfully.

Shapiro's plan calls for a 5% increase in funding for each of the state-related universities:

The state has not increased support for Penn State, Pitt, or Temple since fiscal year 2020. Pennsylvania ranks 49th nationally in public funding for higher education per student, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. Additionally, state funding for the state-related universities has not kept pace with inflation over the past 15 years.

State law requires that the universities spend the appropriation only on costs directly related to student instruction or student-related services. The universities often use the money to create tuition discounts for in-state residents, though it is difficult to track exactly how they spend the money.

Shapiro is proposing a performance-based funding model for the universities, though details of the plan are still being ironed out -- to the consternation of some elected officials in recent budget hearings.

Representatives from each of the state-related universities are part of a working group on higher education. Steve Orbanek, communications director at Temple University, told Spotlight PA via email the working group had met only twice as of early March.

During his February budget address, Shapiro said the formula should incentivize increasing enrollments of first-generation students, keeping alumni in Pennsylvania, and ensuring students in nursing, education and agriculture graduate.

The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education already uses a version of the model. During a Feb. 21 hearing before the state House Appropriations Committee, PASSHE Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said the system's funding plan focuses on sustainable enrollment growth and incentivizes supporting low-income students and students of color.

Not all outcome-based models are the same, Greenstein told the lawmakers, noting different models can prioritize different things.

""If you wanted to, we could develop a performance-based funding model to improve the production of volleyball players from private institutions,"" Greenstein said.

Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi has advocated for a performance-based funding model similar to Shapiro's proposal and pushed state lawmakers to boost support for her university, which receives the lowest amount of per-student public support.

Spotlight PA spoke to two education experts and reviewed research on performance-based funding plans, which showed mixed results for improving academic success or degree completion.

""The biggest advantage of performance funding is it gives the public trust in higher education,"" said Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ""It doesn't particularly improve outcomes, but it at least gives the sense to the public that colleges are accountable for their performance.""

Kelchen co-authored a 2020 study of the funding models, which found that the plans can inadvertently hurt marginalized student groups if specific mitigating measures are not built into the models.

For example, if a funding model prioritizes only degree completion, universities and colleges might become more selective in who they admit. If the model does not account for student financial needs and resources, it can widen gaps between well-resourced institutions and their smaller peers, Kelchen said.

""You want to give colleges an incentive to actually serve students whose success isn't guaranteed,"" he said.

States that use performance-based funding do not use the model to determine the entirety of a school's funding, Kelchen said. Most states allocate less than 10% of an appropriation through such a model, though some states use the model for more than 80% of a school's total allocation.

Last year, state Rep. Jesse Topper, R-Fulton, proposed legislation that would provide additional state funding to Penn State, Pitt, and Temple if they met specific metrics, including graduation rates, retention rates, net tuition and fees, and enrollment in certain programs.

The bill was referred to the chamber's Education Committee, on which Topper is the minority chair. The representative told Spotlight PA he is cautiously optimistic Pennsylvania will adopt a funding model similar to what he has suggested.

""Any time you can support investment with data, that's good public policy,"" he said.

During a February hearing before the state House Appropriations Committee, leaders from each of the state-related universities said a performance-based funding model should be created in collaboration with the legislature and account for the unique missions of each institution.

""I'm in favor of formulas because they are more transparent, but the formula has to take into consideration a really broad range of things,"" Brenda Allen, president of Lincoln University, told lawmakers. ""And I think we have to think very deeply and creatively about what those things are.""

Spotlight PA asked each of the universities to gauge which metrics would be most important to them in the new model.

Representatives from Penn State, Pitt, and Temple said it was too early to discuss specifics.

""There are many potential metrics, but some common metrics used by other institutions of higher education are enrollment, degree completions, graduation rates, transfer rates, and post-graduation economic success, to name just a few,"" a Penn State spokesperson told Spotlight PA via email.

Lincoln did not respond to a request for comment.

During a February hearing of the Pennsylvania Senate Appropriations Committee, state Sen. Lindsey Williams, D-Allegheny, said the funding formula working group expects to share its recommendations by April 10. The state's education department did not respond to a request to confirm this timeline.",mcall.com,news,The Morning Call,,0.05882352941176472,448893432,1,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2022/12/27/HBVRIMIELNFHRCRLAF5H4G3U3I.jpg?w=640,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) released the following statement after voting to pass the second bipartisan government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2024 to provide essential support for hardworking families, students, and service members across Nevada.

""Today we passed strong, bipartisan legislation to support Nevada families, bolster our national defense, invest in border security, and crack down on the deadly flow of fentanyl into our communities,"" said Senator Cortez Masto. ""This package also includes critical funding for programs I've championed, from funding the 988 crisis lifeline and affordable child care to increasing Pell Grants. This bill rejects the senseless efforts by far-right Republicans to shut down the government but responsibly reduces federal spending and delivers for Nevadans across the state.""

This bipartisan government funding package includes $40 million for 24 community projects throughout Nevada. It supports federal programs to lower child care costs for hardworking families, enhance Pell Grants for Nevada students, and strengthen the 988 crisis lifeline Senator Cortez Masto helped create.

The bill includes vital investments in our national defense and border security, and it provides 12,000 new special immigrant visas for our Afghan allies who risked their lives to support the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Senator Cortez Masto championed federal funding to help U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) hire more staff and install technology to detect illicit drugs and other contraband being smuggled through ports of entry. This legislation provides resources to help stop the flow of fentanyl and strengthen efforts to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations like drug cartels.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Westshore Terminals Investment's shares before the 27th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of April.

The company's upcoming dividend is CA$0.725 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of CA$1.40 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Westshore Terminals Investment has a trailing yield of 5.7% on the current share price of CA$26.18. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Westshore Terminals Investment has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.

View our latest analysis for Westshore Terminals Investment

Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 75% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (86%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.

It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Westshore Terminals Investment's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. A high payout ratio of 75% generally happens when a company can't find better uses for the cash. Combined with slim earnings growth in the past few years, Westshore Terminals Investment could be signalling that its future growth prospects are thin.

The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Westshore Terminals Investment has delivered 1.3% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.

Is Westshore Terminals Investment an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Westshore Terminals Investment has struggled to grow its earnings per share, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear unsustainable. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.

So if you want to do more digging on Westshore Terminals Investment, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Westshore Terminals Investment (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares.

The government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), North German Radio said on Friday.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

The German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation estimates that up to 200 hectares of additional heavy-duty area will be required by the end of the decade just for the construction of new offshore wind farms. This corresponds to 270 football fields, it said.

""It helps people, businessmen invest, and it helps all of us Mexicans,"" the president said.

Lopez Obrador added that in terms of public finances, lowering the cost of credit would help lower the variable interest rate on government debt, as 70 percent of the total amount is recorded in pesos rather than in other currencies.

The president stressed that the Mexican currency was not immediately affected by Banxico's measures.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills in the early morning hours Saturday, a long overdue action nearly six months into the budget year that will push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

Norwich City Council has announced that up to 260 of its properties that are expensive to heat and need upgrades will have solar panels, loft insulation and external wall insulation installed.

More than £5m will fund the project, with £2.4m coming from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero's Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund and £2.7m from the city council.

It is predicted that those who benefit from the fund could save up to £400 each year on their energy bills.

This comes after the news that nearly 50,000 homes in Norwich are inefficient and expensive to heat for the people who live in them, amid the high energy bills of the cost of living crisis.

By: Jennifer Shutt - March 22, 2024 11:31 pm

WASHINGTON -- Dozens of federal departments and agencies began a funding lapse early Saturday after the U.S. Senate failed to approve a $1.2 trillion government spending package ahead of a Friday midnight deadline.

The stalemate affected major federal departments -- Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State and Treasury.

It also included numerous smaller entities that no longer have approved government funding, including Congress, the Executive Office of the President, the judiciary and the Social Security Administration.

The brief pause in official appropriations isn't likely to have much effect, though, given that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer set up votes on nine GOP proposals to the package just before midnight.

In making the transition from traditional finance to DeFi, there has been no lack of support, encouragement, and guidance. Embodying a leadership role as a female has also felt free from obstacles or adversity.

However, despite personal experience, it cannot be ignored that the evident gender gap in Web3 has been brought to attention recently. With the recent celebration of International Women's Day, the community must acknowledge that only 13% of founding teams in Web3 include at least ONE woman.

2023 data from Swiss Fintech Innovations also highlighted that only 3.5% of Web3 investment reached women-led Web3 business in the first half of 2023.Clearly, there is a disparity and a balance that needs amending. Powerful female leaders, with the innovative approaches they can bring, are needed for Web3's continued evolution. But does the answer to bridging the gap simply lie in providing more funding?

Partially, yes. But more money for female startups isn't a complete solution. That's one-dimensional. All women in Web3, founders or not, can continue to empower themselves in day-to-day approaches.

Three main areas to consider are: embracing fear, leveraging existing expertise, and building connections.

Blockchain technology, decentralization, and Web3 ecosystems can be confusing areas to navigate. Nonetheless, acquiring new knowledge should breed excitement alongside any potential fear or doubt. It's easy to allow thoughts of ""not knowing enough"" and ""not being up to speed"" take over. This can trigger feelings of inadequacy or overwhelm in a male-dominated industry. But women should embrace their unique ability to learn.

With a fluid and curious approach, women's compassionate abilities often shine through in taking on diverse information. Complexities in understanding should not be feared to the point of freeze or flight. Instead, women must recognize their capabilities and choose to fight through them. Study; ask questions - with confidence. The more knowledge acquired, the more empowerment comes. The dissolution of boundaries and barriers follow, and the playing field will naturally level out.

Because Web3 is such a novel, unique space - it's easy to slip into the idea that fresh and unique personalities, approaches, and ideas will be the only route to success. Again, doubt can creep in.

But women in Web3 need to remind themselves of the wealth of experience, leadership skills, and knowledge they've carried over from Web2 industries. Communication counts in Web3. Marketing counts in Web3. Creative arts count in Web3.

Traditional financial knowledge counts in Web3. HR counts in Web3. Event management counts in Web3. Gender is irrelevant when it comes to niche professional strengths. Women should constantly be supported to self-advocate for what they can bring from past careers. They must identify and utilize their strengths; this will serve best as they continue learning in conjunction.

Ideas are the currency of Web3, and creative individuality is the compass. It doesn't matter who it is coming from - so long as direction and purpose are expressed with confidence and conviction. That said, the opportunity to form potential partnerships and connections is abundant.

Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. It's important to recognize and place faith in the mutual respect, collaborative energy, and inclusive environment found in abundance in Web3 communities. It is the cornerstone for the exponential innovation that has occurred in such a short period within the space.

Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. Strength in unity extends beyond any gender divide, and the more it is nurtured, the easier it gets for everyone.

Overall, Web3 is progressing in many different verticals, and inclusion must be one of them. Women in Web3 play a crucial role in upholding and nourishing the broader ecosystem. Whether within regulatory landscapes, creative industries, educational reform, or digital asset development, Web3 needs women. Funding is welcomed - but there is no need to wait for it.

Females can take the lead and be assured that the community will support and nurture their efforts. Initiative, confidence, and commitment will be the most significant determinants of an improved female influence - not money.

The Indo-German Partnership for Green and Sustainable Development was launched on 2 May 2022 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as a joint commitment in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The areas of cooperation include green energy transition, sustainable cities and addressing climate change.

Scholz is also expected to visit India after the Indian and European Union parliamentary elections, for the next round of intergovernmental consultations.

Ackermann said that the major investments from the government of Germany till 2030 would be in public transportation and renewable energy. As per its commitment, Berlin is set to invest EUR 10 billion by 2030.

""There is always a huge need for public infrastructure projects. This is the biggest credit line worth almost EUR 500 million. As you know India is heavily investing in public infrastructure and also public transport. There I see a huge need for these very favourable credit lines. I would say this may be where most of the money goes,"" he added.

As a part of the project, the Indian and German governments are also working together on triangular cooperation projects, with an aim to promote sustainable development in third countries across Africa, Asia and South America, Ackermann highlighted.

""This very specific triangular cooperation is more of a trilateral cooperation -- where we with knowhow from both sides [India and Germany] come together and try to figure out how to help in a very concrete and practical way the farming community -- mostly its about agriculture -- in the third countries,"" the ambassador said.

He added that these projects may not be very big but are focused on tangible outcomes in countries like Peru, Malawi, Ghana, Benin and Cameroon.

Ackermann emphasised that triangular cooperation within the GSDP is between India, Germany and another country and not through multilateral fora like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) of which Germany is a member.",theprint.in,news,ThePrint,Keshav Padmanabhan,0.2784313725490195,448891650,1,https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ACKERMANN.jpg,eng-9419842

A first drive of the 2024 Volkswagen ID.4, with a vastly better infotainment interface and a little more acceleration punch complementing an otherwise already great set of attributes, showed us that the ID.4 is now the opening act for trendier VW EVs that it was originally supposed to be.

In a preview drive of the 2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron, we saw the promise in Audi's first fully conceived, best executed EV -- thanks in part to the new PPE platform it shares with the Porsche Macan EV.

Green Car Reports also drove the 2024 Lexus RX 450h+ and found it to have a usable electric-only range and comfortable ride but rather expensive and unimpressive in its infotainment interface.

BMW provided a first look at another concept previewing its next generation of EVs. The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X is an electric SUV anticipated for production as soon as 2025 and built on an 800-volt architecture, providing super-fast charging and a bidirectional charging toolkit.

DOE and EPA rules finalized this week give automakers a little more flexibility in complying with pending rules for model years 2027 to 2032. The EPA estimates it will take about 56% EVs by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids.

Rivian has confirmed that in April it will start shipping the NACS adapters that will, with interface updates, allow owners to plan road trips with Tesla Supercharger stations as waypoints. It also nearly doubles the number of fast-chargers Rivian drivers can access through the interface.

As it seeks to sell down an inventory of about 4,700 vehicles, Fisker has paused production of its Ocean EV. Meanwhile, it confirmed ""a financing commitment"" of up to $150 million, said it continues to negotiate with another automaker -- reportedly Nissan -- over a strategic partnership, and is pursuing a franchised-dealership model.

Shell announced this week that it's planning to shed some gas stations in favor of EV charging. It also announced that it plans to expand the number of EV chargers it operates from 54,000 today to 200,000 by 2030.

A recently filed GM patent application suggests that the automaker is considering battery cells with Lego-like shapes that might allow easier cooling in battery-pack configurations. It's unclear whether or not such an idea is serious, as GM is in the midst of ramping up large-format pouch cells for its Ultium EV family and has committed to cylindrical cells for some future EVs.

Nearly 150,000 EVs from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis were recalled in the U.S. earlier this week over an electronics issue that could cause 12-volt batteries to fail while driving. It follows an international recall and is over the same component that could result in a sudden loss of drive power.

Former President Donald Trump said that he will apply a tariff of 100% to cars made in Mexico by Chinese companies for U.S.-market sale, he said in a campaign speech Saturday. Trump also appeared again to deride electric vehicles as short on range and too expensive.

In a new Saudi Arabian desert EV range and efficiency run of its EQXX design and engineering concept, Mercedes-Benz has shown substantial gains not just from the use of a next-generation heat pump but also from a solar roof -- a sign there may be hope after all for the feature in future models from the luxury brand.

Norwich City Council has announced that up to 260 of its properties that are expensive to heat and need upgrades will have solar panels, loft insulation and external wall insulation installed.

More than £5m will fund the project, with £2.4m coming from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero's Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund and £2.7m from the city council.

It is predicted that those who benefit from the fund could save up to £400 each year on their energy bills.

This comes after the news that nearly 50,000 homes in Norwich are inefficient and expensive to heat for the people who live in them, amid the high energy bills of the cost of living crisis.

Ms Hanks added: ""With more than half of Norwich's housing still falling below a decent energy performance standard, we need to see long-term funding from central government rather than the piecemeal schemes on offer at the moment, so that the council can work with communities and businesses to give every household access to energy efficiency upgrades.""

In a statement late Friday, the foundation said it welcomed a reported government move to contribute to the costs of expanding the terminal at the port of Cuxhaven, on the North Sea coast.

The government has agreed to finance the 30-hectare (74 acres) expansion of the offshore terminal together with the state of Lower Saxony and the private port industry, at a cost of around 300 million euros ($324.15 million), North German Radio said on Friday.

""The expansion of the Cuxhaven port is a central project for the expansion of renewable energies,"" said spokespeople for the government ministries for economic affairs and climate protection, and digital and transport, according to the foundation statement.

The German government has been approached for comment.

Germany's BWE power association on Wednesday called for the government to take expansion costs into account in its national ports strategy to meet the country's energy transition plans.

Transport Minister Volker Wissing this week said the federal government was committed to its responsibility for ports, including financially.

The German Offshore Wind Energy Foundation estimates that up to 200 hectares of additional heavy-duty area will be required by the end of the decade just for the construction of new offshore wind farms.

The technical summary data tells us to buy HUBB near 390.84, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 389.71 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 390.84 is the first level of support below 417.92, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 390.84 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy HUBB just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 0 in case the stock turns against the trade. n/a is the first level of resistance above 417.92, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of HUBB if it tests n/a with a downside target of 413.22. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Web3 has always felt like an inclusive and empowering community to be a part of.

In making the transition from traditional finance to DeFi, there has been no lack of support, encouragement, and guidance. Embodying a leadership role as a female has also felt free from obstacles or adversity.

However, despite personal experience, it cannot be ignored that the evident gender gap in Web3 has been brought to attention recently. With the recent celebration of International Women's Day, the community must acknowledge that only 13% of founding teams in Web3 include at least ONE woman.

2023 data from Swiss Fintech Innovations also highlighted that only 3.5% of Web3 investment reached women-led Web3 business in the first half of 2023.Clearly, there is a disparity and a balance that needs amending. Powerful female leaders, with the innovative approaches they can bring, are needed for Web3's continued evolution. But does the answer to bridging the gap simply lie in providing more funding?

Partially, yes. But more money for female startups isn't a complete solution. That's one-dimensional. All women in Web3, founders or not, can continue to empower themselves in day-to-day approaches.

Three main areas to consider are: embracing fear, leveraging existing expertise, and building connections.

Blockchain technology, decentralization, and Web3 ecosystems can be confusing areas to navigate. Nonetheless, acquiring new knowledge should breed excitement alongside any potential fear or doubt. It's easy to allow thoughts of ""not knowing enough"" and ""not being up to speed"" take over. This can trigger feelings of inadequacy or overwhelm in a male-dominated industry. But women should embrace their unique ability to learn.

With a fluid and curious approach, women's compassionate abilities often shine through in taking on diverse information. Complexities in understanding should not be feared to the point of freeze or flight. Instead, women must recognize their capabilities and choose to fight through them. Study; ask questions - with confidence. The more knowledge acquired, the more empowerment comes. The dissolution of boundaries and barriers follow, and the playing field will naturally level out.

Because Web3 is such a novel, unique space - it's easy to slip into the idea that fresh and unique personalities, approaches, and ideas will be the only route to success. Again, doubt can creep in.

But women in Web3 need to remind themselves of the wealth of experience, leadership skills, and knowledge they've carried over from Web2 industries. Communication counts in Web3. Marketing counts in Web3. Creative arts count in Web3.

Traditional financial knowledge counts in Web3. HR counts in Web3. Event management counts in Web3. Gender is irrelevant when it comes to niche professional strengths. Women should constantly be supported to self-advocate for what they can bring from past careers. They must identify and utilize their strengths; this will serve best as they continue learning in conjunction.

Ideas are the currency of Web3, and creative individuality is the compass. It doesn't matter who it is coming from - so long as direction and purpose are expressed with confidence and conviction. That said, the opportunity to form potential partnerships and connections is abundant.

Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. It's important to recognize and place faith in the mutual respect, collaborative energy, and inclusive environment found in abundance in Web3 communities. It is the cornerstone for the exponential innovation that has occurred in such a short period within the space.

Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. Strength in unity extends beyond any gender divide, and the more it is nurtured, the easier it gets for everyone.

Overall, Web3 is progressing in many different verticals, and inclusion must be one of them. Women in Web3 play a crucial role in upholding and nourishing the broader ecosystem. Whether within regulatory landscapes, creative industries, educational reform, or digital asset development, Web3 needs women. Funding is welcomed - but there is no need to wait for it.

Females can take the lead and be assured that the community will support and nurture their efforts. Initiative, confidence, and commitment will be the most significant determinants of an improved female influence - not money.",cryptoslate.com,news,CryptoSlate,,0.1372549019607843,448890619,1,https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/women-web3.jpg,

Plans include a complete refit, the addition of a fourth screen for educational use, and reducing the seating capacity from 450 to 350 to make it more comfortable, as well as increasing accessibility inside the cinema.

James Rice, who began working in the box office in 2003 before leaving in 2019, said without the funding the future would have been uncertain.

Mr Rice said: ""If we hadn't got the grant, I don't know what the outcome would have been.

""The refit matters because it helps us to attract new people in. We want to try to introduce people to a broader range of cinema.

""The core message is to deliver a full programme, including documentaries and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

""A large proportion of what we do is not screened at other cinemas.

Mr Rice said cinema faced new challenges from streaming services and firesticks, but that Edinburgh had seen an increase of 33% turnout in cinemas over the past year compared to 2022.

The Filmhouse described its programme as ""the most ambitious cultural film programme outside the British Film Theatre"" in London's Southbank and also hosted the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years.

Options are being explored regarding pricing, including ""pay what you can"", and efforts are being made to ensure cost is not a barrier to accessibility.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

- Shutdown preparations 'ceased' -

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",rawstory.com,news,Raw Story,,0.0980392156862746,448890268,1,https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/mike-johnson-now-stuck-with-the-worst-job-in-washington-politico.jpg?id=50307448&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C110%2C0%2C111,

The proposed legislation, S-3058, seeks to mitigate the impact of sharp fluctuations in state aid allocations, which have threatened to slash budgets for numerous districts, sometimes by double-digit percentages.

Senator Singleton (D-Burlington) highlighted the necessity of the bill, emphasizing the need for stability and fairness in funding distribution without resorting to hikes in local property taxes. Under the new legislation, state aid growth for school districts would be capped at the rate of inflation. However, exceptions are made for schools in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, which could see an additional one percent increase in aid.

The senator expressed concern over the current system's propensity to create significant disparities in school funding, advocating for a model that avoids pitting districts against one another. The legislation aims to ensure no district faces cuts in funding, particularly without burdening taxpayers with increased local taxes.

Furthermore, the bill introduces a mechanism for ""Necessary Stabilization Aid,"" allowing districts that would have experienced aid increases above the inflationary cap to apply for additional support. This aid is designed to bridge the gap created by the new limits, with applicants required to detail their financial need and how they plan to utilize the funds effectively.",shorenewsnetwork.com,news,Shore News Network,,0.1294117647058823,448889675,1,https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dreamstime_s_115138972.jpg,eng-9414525

But the elected representatives meeting in Washington also took the opportunity to take a much more controversial measure: a ban on all direct funding from the United States to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.

UNRWA has been at the heart of a controversy since Israel in January accused 12 of its 13,000 or so employees in Gaza of involvement in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The ban will remain in place for one year, until March 2025.

According to the investigative magazine The Intercept, the bill also contains a provision limiting aid to the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied West Bank, if ""the Palestinians initiate or actively support an investigation authorized by the International Criminal Court (ICC) that subjects Israeli nationals to investigation for alleged crimes committed against Palestinians.""

The bill still has to be sent to President Joe Biden for his signature, which he is expected to provide on Saturday.

The bill's passing is a major blow for UNRWA. In 2022, the United States was UNRWA's main donor, with an overall contribution of $344 million. In June 2023, before the start of the war in Gaza, it announced an envelope of more than $153 million, and it was the first to suspend its funding of the agency at the end of January after it launched an investigation to verify the Israeli accusations.

Israeli reaction

Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz welcomed the passing of the bill, taking to his X account to urge countries around the world to follow the example of the United States and cut their funding to UNRWA.

""The historic ban on US funding of UNRWA, which was passed today with overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we have known all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and cannot be part of the solution. UNRWA will not be part of the landscape of Gaza after the fall of Hamas,"" the minister wrote. The senior official also claimed that ""thousands of UNRWA employees are involved in Hamas's terrorist activities and their facilities have been used for terrorist purposes.""

The passing of this bill comes at a time when the Israeli offensive in Gaza is coming under increasing international criticism. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Hamas; aid agencies are sounding alarm bells at the risk of widespread famine; and the material damage has impacted more than 121,000 homes and infrastructure facilities in the enclave. Israel's plans for an offensive in Rafah, a town in the south of the besieged enclave where some 1.5 million refugees have fled to escape the fighting, were at the heart of discussions in Tel Aviv on Friday between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

On Friday, UNRWA chief, Philippe Lazzarini, announced that all the Nordic countries had resumed funding the agency after cutting it off at the beginning of the year following accusations by the Israeli government.

Contacted by the Al-Jazeera TV channel, Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute (AAI), described the adoption of the bill as ""an incredible moral failure.""

""Our political process has chosen to cut US funding to the only entity capable of responding to the level of suffering and the scale of suffering in Gaza,"" Al-Jazeera quotes Berry as saying.",today.lorientlejour.com,news,L'Orient Today,,-0.1450980392156863,448889665,1,https://s.lorientlejour.com/storage/attachments/1409/ert_328992copy_479338.jpg/r/800/ert_328992copy_479338.jpg,eng-9412421

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

When you grow, your income increases, and you plan to invest more, then you can do so through step-up SIP. Many mutual funds do not allow you to increase your SIP amount in between the SIPs. In that case, if you plan to increase your investment from next year say by a fixed amount or a fixed percentage then step-up SIP is the option. Step-up SIP gives chances of building greater wealth.

With step-up SIP, you can start your investment with a basic amount and then increase the amount by a certain fixed percentage or fixed amount till it reaches your goal. This helps the investor estimate the growth of SIP investment if the investor wants to increase the investment every year. Step-up SIP helps you estimate the future value of your SIP investment, which increases over a period by a fixed percentage or amount.

To calculate how much earn if you increase your SIP investment every year, you just need a computer, excel, and investment details such as monthly SIP contribution, an annual step-up you want, the expected rate of return you want on your investments, and the period for which you are increasing your investment.

Suppose your initial SIP amount is Rs 10,000 per month for a tenure of 5 years. In the first column enter the SIP dates and in the next column enter the SIP amount.

Suppose you are planning to increase your investment by Rs 2500 per year. Then enter the amount in the next column by adding Rs 2500 every year to your initial investment.

Once you added the step-up SIP amount for the total investment horizon and entered the NAV of the scheme, calculate the total units you will be accumulating if investing only through SIP and step-up SIP modes. At the end, calculate total units accumulating via both the modes.

In different cells enter the initial amount of your investment, the expected rate of return, and the step-up amount by which you want to increase your SIP investments every year. Once you enter all these details, calculate the total amount invested if invested by step-up SIP investment. Then write the total units you will be accumulating. Then write the last NAV available. Calculate the total profit earned by multiplying the last NAV with the total units and subtracting the total amount invested. And then in the last calculate the total amount you will earn if you increase your SIP investment (sum of total amount invested and profit earned).",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.388235294117647,448888979,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108732081,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-21826,overlay-etwealthmutualfunds/photo.jpg",

When they hear the word ""Jeep,"" an image of the Wrangler flashes in their minds. Jeep owners have a passion for their vehicles, rivaled by no other car enthusiast -- so much so that the manufacturer hides Easter eggs in its vehicles. Does that passion translate into a wise investment, though?

Many factors go into calculating a vehicle's value, from its paint color to how it handles on the road. However, an excellent initial value doesn't necessarily translate into a good investment vehicle, especially since cars depreciate the moment they're driven off the lot. While it's important for drivers to be happy with the car they're driving, thinking of their purchase as an investment is the best way to work toward that dream car one day.

Learning about a vehicle's depreciation rate before purchasing can help you maximize the resale value of your vehicle. The car you buy today could be the car you trade in for tomorrow, greatly decreasing the amount owed.

This is reminiscent of the time when the industry had reached the $7 billion foreign investment limit and had to suspend flows in funds investing in stocks overseas. These limits probably were put in place to limit outflows of foreign currency within a limit to reduce the impact on balance of payments and thereby on the Indian currency, Mehta said.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

The Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) received a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instructing a cessation of new investments in ETFs allocating funds to overseas markets, as per Angel One. This action comes in response to the nearing breach of the upper limit for ETFs set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, currently standing at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Effective from April 1, 2024, fund of funds (FoFs) investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on international markets will be required to halt the acceptance of new investments.

""We are continuing to invest in China, in the supply chain, in R&D and in our stores,"" Cook said in a video clip of the meeting.

The raised funds will be used by the edtech startup to scale up in international markets, as well as strengthen academics research, technology, and product teams.

Founded by IIT-Delhi alumni Shailendra Dhakad and Rupika Taneja in November 2019, Codeyoung is on a mission to develop cognitive skills and creative thinking among children through coding. The startup offers coding courses to K12 students between five and 16 years of age, which is in line with India's new education policy. The amendment prescribes courses in programming and web development for students in Class 6 and above.

""We started our journey by making programmes in coding as a way to impart necessary skills to school kids in an enjoyable and engaging way. Now, we have more than 15,000+ kids globally enrolled in our various programmes. The funding will help us in reaching out to more students and launching more programmes aligned with our vision,"" said Rupika Taneja, Co-founder, Codeyoung.

The curriculum is designed to instil creativity among kids and empower them to express their various interests and ideas through coding. It extends beyond the drag and drop environment, and equips kids with skills to create industry-standard programmes on popular languages like Python and Java.

""We believe coding will be as important as any other language skill in the coming days, and introducing such courses at an early age will be crucial. We are proud to partner with the Codeyoung team and help them achieve their vision,"" Apoorv Gautam, India Head and COO, Guild Capital, added.

According to Shailendra Dhakad, Co-founder of Codeyoung, the startup plans to launch several coding courses and engagement initiatives that will address the learning gaps, thus contributing towards the child's overall educational well-being.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

""The one area we have continued to underfund are our public schools,"" Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, told the audience at the Quad Cities Chamber-hosted legislative forum on the St. Ambrose University campus.

Winckler said school districts aren't able to keep up with increasing costs, and that the state should approve a larger increase in State Supplemental Aid than 2.5%.

""We should be investing in our public education systems and be giving them more than the 2.5% that we see in the budget,"" Winckler said. ""At this particular time, we can afford it and we can do it.""

Rep. Mike Vondran, R-Davenport, disagreed, noting that the House's bill on top of a 2.5% increase in supplemental aid, also included funding for teacher pay and supplemental staff.

""It's not just talking about numbers, it's talking about what it is that we can do to make things real,"" Vondran said. ""We're talking about lives here, we're talking about our most valued assets, our children, let's get serious about that. It's not just about a percentage. There's a lot more to it.""

The bill rolled together an overhaul of the Area Education Agencies with state supplemental aid and teacher pay. Previously, those measures were separate proposals.

The proposal passed 51-47 with nine Republicans joining all Democrats in voting against it.

It is the latest attempt by Republicans to deliver changes to the state's Area Education Agencies. The topic has consumed much of the legislative session after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds made it a priority in her Condition of the State speech to kick off the session in January.

Iowa's nine AEAs oversee special education in the state and provide consulting services to school districts in their areas.

The governor argues Iowa's special education test scores have not kept up with the rest of the nation, but her proposal to allow schools to look elsewhere for services prompted fierce opposition from parents of special education students and educators who are concerned diverting funds from AEAs would hurt special education services. Some superintendents are in favor of the proposal who want more control over their special education dollars.

The House version passed Thursday evening would, once fully phased in, require schools to spend 90% of their special education funding with the AEA and 10% could be used for special education through a third party.

Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, was among the nine Republicans that voted against the bill. Speaking with the Quad-City Times/Dispatch-Argus, he said he had concerns about centralizing more control at the state level under the Department of Education and making the local boards more advisory rather than a supervisory.

""I'm a big proponent of local control,"" Mohr said.

The other reason he voted no was because he preferred the state set up a task force to include special needs parents, teachers and special needs personnel to identify changes needed and put forward a proposal rather than the other way around.

He emphasized that he supported the SSA increase and teacher pay raises, but voted no on the overall bill because of his concerns in the AEA provisions.

Work-based learning

A work-based learning bill proposed by the governor is stalled for now in the statehouse while funding is worked out, Mohr told the audience.

The bill would create a workforce opportunity fund for Iowa Workforce Development programs with up to $30 million from a state unemployment reserve fund.

Mohr said a work-based learning program fund ""in theory I think is very good.""

But he questioned taking $30 million from the unemployment reserve fund.

""It looks to me like we're using one-time money to fund an ongoing expense, and that I don't support. ...It has nothing to do with the value of the bill, but I'm sitting on the bill until I can get answers because I'm not going to use one-time money to fund an ongoing expense,"" he said.

Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, said the bill sets up a funding stream for on-the-job learning, for example if a student wanted to become a diesel mechanic or carpenter, they could receive credits for it in community college or high schools.

Gruenhagen disagreed with concerns about funding it with the unemployment reserve. He said the reserve fund hasn't been drawn down even in the recession years of '08 and '09 nor during COVID-19, and there was enough funding to put toward the program.

Immigration

In response to an audience member who asked about how the state is addressing illegal immigration, Republicans praised a bill the House passed this week that would allow state law enforcement officials to arrest and order the removal of individuals who are not legal U.S. residents. A federal judge has put a hold on similar proposals in a ruling on a Texas law.

Democrats, however, were more critical of the Republican bill.

Rep. Ken Croken, D-Davenport, questioned how the state would send the people it arrests to a port of entry, and whether that would take local law enforcement authorities away from other public safety work.

""I take no pleasure whatsoever in knowing that Iowa state troopers will be driving immigrants to the border with Mexico,"" Croken said.

Gruenhagen, referencing earlier comments on education, claimed illegal immigration is increasing costs to schools.

""When you have different language coming into our schools, it's costing our teachers money out of their pocket,"" Gruenhagen said. ""They need translation software to teach these students. Every school district I spoke to prior to session...did have an increase. This is not only a direct cost to taxpayers with your property tax with your school funding, teachers are also burdened with these different languages that they have in a class of 20, 25, 30 students.""

Vondran asked the Davenport schools Superintendent TJ Schneckloth, who was in the audience, how many languages were spoken in the Davenport school district.

Schneckloth replied 30 languages. He added that school districts in the area have robust English Language Learning programs, but schools can have difficulty when a student show up unexpectedly and the school must establish a program, which can result in some lost learning for the student.

He said locating translators in all those languages has been a big challenge and that the school district is preparing for more refugees to come to the Iowa side, while in the past more resources were located on the Illinois side.

Croken then said, ""Having 30 languages in your school district is also an asset, it's not just a problem, it's an asset as we're trying to get young people ready to be world-ready, that starts in elementary school.""

Vondran said he agreed with Croken.

""Challenges turn into opportunities, and that's what we need to be focused on,"" Vondran said. ""Instead of looking for the pain and the problem, look for the opportunity that's going to result from that.""

Other topics: rail, victim services

Maggie Tinsman, a former state senator and lobbyist for greater protections against human trafficking, asked legislators again for an additional $5 million for victim services fund in the state.

Lawmakers thanked Tinsman for her relentless advocacy on the issue, and Mohr said he hoped to increase the victim services fund by some amount. He said they were also waiting on a federal decision that he said may reduce the federal funding toward victim services.

In February, the Iowa House passed a bill that would enter Iowa into the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Compact to coordinate among Midwestern states to promote development of passenger and high-speed passenger rail in the Midwest.

The Quad-Cities has for more than a decade awaited the construction of a rail line connecting Moline to Chicago, and while the Illinois and federal funding is there, negotiations with the rail company that owns some of the lines have stalled for years.

Iowa also has proposed in the past supporting a passenger rail system to Iowa City.

Mohr said while he's nostalgic for passenger rail, which he said he rode as a kid, he didn't think the math worked out long term for passenger rail to support itself.

""I'm not willing to invest your tax money ad-infinitum to a taxpayer assisted passenger rail service,"" while Amtrack goes across the southern part of Iowa.

Croken said he'd support more passenger rail if it got people places more efficiently.

Kurth agreed and said more people taking passenger rail would take cars off the road or reduce plane rides, which would have environmental benefits.

In a move towards greater transparency and collaboration, four Caribbean nations within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enhance their Citizenship by Investment Programmes (CBIPs).

The signing ceremony, conducted virtually, saw leaders from Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, and St Kitts and Nevis coming together to commit to stricter regulations and cooperative efforts within the industry.

Key changes include raising the minimum investment threshold to USD 200,000, with a deadline set for June 30, 2024.

This decision follows concerns raised by international entities regarding the pricing and integrity of such programmes. The MOU aims to address these concerns by promoting transparency and accountability.

Under the agreement, the four nations pledge to share information on CBIP applicants, disclose funds received through CBIPs, and establish a regional authority to regulate and set international standards for the programmes.

The move signifies a proactive step towards ensuring fairness and credibility in the CBIPs offered by these OECS nations, reflecting their commitment to responsible governance and adherence to best practices.

While highlighting this collaboration, Prime Minister of St Kitts and Nevis and Chairman of the OECS, Dr Terrance Drew, said that it will help in exchanging best practices while enhancing due diligence processes and enabling sharing intelligence on potential security or even compliance risks.

PM Drew lauded his fellow Prime Ministers for recognising that Citizenship by Investment Programmes are very significant for the region as a whole, which is why it was their duty to act responsibly.

He also said that this strategic move would show the world that the four Caribbean countries are responsible and serious about operating investment migration programmes which respect the rule of law and are sustainable.

While emphasising the purpose of the MOU, PM Drew said that he strives to provide a framework for partnership and information sharing among the four OECS Member States in relation to the country's CBI Programmes.

Meanwhile, it is also being said that as the Caribbean countries move forward with implementing such stringent measures, this MOU marks a major milestone in the evolution of their CBI Programme.",wicnews.com,news,WIC News,Monica Walker,0.3647058823529412,448887938,1,http://wicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/feature-image-carribian-countires-e1711191740556.jpg,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider.

He said the country could take advantage of that economic policy to position itself as an attractive destination for investment, fostering economic growth, creating job opportunities, and contributing to the development of the retail sector.

Mr Dsane, now based in Ghana, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview on Friday that due to evolving the global economic landscape, it was imperative to consider the adoption of the proposal as a policy to enhance job creation and employment opportunities for the youth.

""Embracing the 24-hour- economy is a strategic move for Ghana to catalyze economic growth, reduce unemployment, and enhance global competitiveness,"" he said.

""By adopting a holistic approach and implementing supportive policies and infrastructure, Ghana could unlock its full economic potential and improve the well-being of the citizenry.""

He outlined the key reasons and benefits of transitioning to a 24-hour work system and suggested strategies for its successful implementation to encourage businesses to operate ""24-seven"".

These include tax incentives, regulatory reforms, and financial support for businesses making the transition, investment in reliable and efficient infrastructures like transportation, energy and communication systems to support uninterrupted operations.

Others are to provide training to equip the workforce with the skills required to make a 24-hour working system thrive, ensuring a seamless transition and maximizing the benefits of extended working hours.

Mr Dsane stressed on public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the benefits while addressing concerns or misconceptions about the policy. Seeking collaboration with international organisations and countries that had been successful in the implementation of a 24-hour-economy must also be prioritised, he said.

After a day of total procedural hijinks, the Senate passed the government funding bills in the early morning hours of Saturday, having struck an eleventh-hour amendment agreement to allow expedited passage of the bill.

The $1.2 trillion government funding bill will now be sent to President Biden's desk as the late night drama on Capitol Hill caps a turbulent process featuring a year of haggling, six months of stopgaps and intense partisan clashes over money and policy.

Majority Leader Schumer announced the agreement on the floor early Saturday morning.

""It's been a very long and difficult day but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government. It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal it wasn't easy but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the American people that we have reached an agreement to fund the government tonight.""

The White House said shortly after midnight that the Office of Management and Budget ceased its shutdown preparations, citing ""a high degree of confidence"" that Congress will ""imminently pass"" funding bills to keep the government open.

President Joe Biden will sign the legislation on Saturday, the White House added.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House said.

The bills passed in a House 286-134 vote earlier Friday afternoon, despite pushback from far-right members of the Republican caucus. More Democrats backed the bill than Republicans as more than 100 GOP lawmakers voted against it.

The $1.2 trillion package -- considered a major bipartisan effort in the highly divided House -- provides funding for six bills including Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor and Health and Human Services and Education, Legislative Branch and State and Foreign Operations.

If the package is passed by both chambers, the government will be funded through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. It will also put an end to the continuing resolution cycle that has led to Congress nearly shutting the government down, at least partially, five times since October.

The government funding package was introduced in the House under suspension of the rules, which required a two-thirds majority vote for passage. That meant, yet again, House Speaker Mike Johnson needed to rely on Democrats to get the bills across the finish line -- a move that landed his predecessor Kevin McCarthy in hot water and led to his ouster as speaker last year.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., took to the floor during an hour of debate to urge lawmakers to vote yes.

""This is a good result for the American people in terms of standing up for their health, their safety, their education, their national security protection and, of course, above all else, their economic wellbeing,"" Jeffries said.

The move of the Norway-based Norges Bank provided a shot in the arm of ICICI Securities' plan to delist itself as it needs two-thirds of the public shareholders' support to pass the resolution. However, Quantum Mutual Fund, which holds a 0.09 per cent stake in ICICI Securities, voted against the resolution on Thursday. Quantum Mutual Fund opposed the delisting as it did not find the swap share ratio lucrative to the shareholders of ICICI Securities. As per the scheme of arrangement, shareholders of ICICI Securities will get 67 shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 shares they hold.

The much-loved independent cinema first opened in a former church in 1979 with just one screen.

However, it became a mainstay of the capital's movie scene over the years and had a programme compared to the British Film Theatre in London. Sadly, it had to shut down in October 2022 when umbrella company Centre for the Moving Image collapsed.

A grassroots campaign, which was supported by actors Ewen Bremner and Brian Cox, was launched to save it. A business model was created and a board of trustees formed, including some people who had worked at the Filmhouse for more than 20 years, with the aim of reopening the venue.

Their Crowdfunder has so far raised over £250,000 of its £300,000 goal. And on March 19, the trustees were told their application to the Levelling Up fund had been successful and they are readying themselves to sign the lease on May 1 and give the place a big makeover.

They want to completely refit the Filmhouse, add a fourth screen for educational purposes, and make the cinema more comfortable and accessible - reducing seating capacity from 450 to 350.

James Rice, who worked there from 2003 to 2019, said: ""If we hadn't got the grant, I don't know what the outcome would have been.

""The refit matters because it helps us to attract new people in. We want to try to introduce people to a broader range of cinema. The core message is to deliver a full programme, including documentaries and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

""A large proportion of what we do is not screened at other cinemas. We have got to this point because of the strength of feeling and support, from letter writing and public meetings. There's some people who worked here who went on to be film-makers.""

Mr Rice acknowledged that online streaming services provided new challenges for theatres but pointed out that Edinburgh saw a 33 per cent increase in cinema visits in 2023 compared to the previous year.

The Filmhouse was a well-known venue for the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years regarded its programme as ""the most ambitious cultural film programme outside the British Film Theatre"".

Trustee Ginnie Atkinson said the UK Government funding was ""transformational"" and that a further £800,000 had been raised from donors and philanthropists. She revealed they have plans to ""modernise"" the venue and are looking at a 'pay what you can' system for tickets to ensure no one is priced out of the cinema.

She said: ""This is absolutely transformational. When we applied the amount was aspirational. We have to attract new audiences and make it a modern, comfortable cinema experience.""

Ginnie revealed that they are hoping to open on October 6, which would be the two-year anniversary of the site closing, but admitted that it could take six months to a year for the Filmhouse to be ready.

During a tour of the site, Scotland Office minister Donald Cameron said ""communities"" which benefited included artists, international students, and those living outside Edinburgh.

Mr Cameron, a list MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said: ""It's really important that a facility like this is accessible to everyone. People travel from the Borders to visit. We hope it attracts people from across Scotland.""

""We hope the Filmhouse will be able to open again. It is for the local community. I think it's right that the UK Government is funding it.""

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

The project will be funded under Tax Credit Scheme by BUA Group.

He said FG had agreed to BUA's commitment to construct 30 kilometer of the road under the tax credit scheme after which a tax certificate would be awarded to the company.

Minister of Works David Umahi made this disclosure during a press briefing in Abuja, meeting with contractors handling the road projects.

Umahi said that three other contractors would be mobilised for the construction of the remaining 30 kilometres.

""Four contractors will handle the four sections off the road.

The first section from Lokoja is being handled by CGC, the second section is being handled by Mother Cat Limited.

The third section is handled by Dantata and Sawoe while the last section is handled by RCC.

""Let me say that this project was first awarded in 2012, later the last administration reviewed the

project to N879 billion under the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) tax credit scheme.

""The costs of the project is different from the commitment of NNPC because NNPC's commitment was just N122 billion and so there was a funding gap of N775 billion and I don't see where that money is coming from.

""So all I did when we came onboard was to keep the project but review the texture of the pavement, by allowing the existing carriageway to be asphalt and then reviewed the new carriage way to be concrete.''

Umahi said that the ministry would mobilise the contractors after signing an addendum to collect 30 per cent fund to fast track the project amounting to N9 billion each.

He emphasized that the contractors would do an affidavit agreeing on the timing for completion of the project.

Earlier, Senator representing Edo North Senatorial District Adams Oshiomhole, said the Renewed Hope administration of Mr. President in changing the socio-economic narrative of the nation through aggressive road infrastructure transformation .

He also appreciated the minister works for his commitment in achieving the vision of Mr. President on road infrastructure development.

Meanwhile, Group Executive Director, BUA Group Kabiru Rabiu, expressed the company's committed to supporting the administration of President Bola Tinubu to succeed.

He noted that ""In Edo alone, BUA made an investment of over 2billion dollars with five lines of cement.

The independent cinema opened in 1979 in a former Presbyterian Church with only one screen but became a cultural icon with a programme compared to the British Film Theatre in London.

It closed on October 6, 2022 following the collapse of umbrella company Centre for the Moving Image (CMI) and a grassroots campaign began to save it, backed by actors including Ewen Bremner and Brian Cox.

A business model was created to relaunch the cinema, with a board of trustees including some who worked there for two decades.

A Crowdfunder which aimed to raise £300,000 has almost met its target at £254,430.

The trustees learned on March 19 their application for money from the Levelling Up Fund was being granted by the UK Government and are preparing to sign the lease on May 1 ahead of a huge refurbishment.

Plans include a complete refit, the addition of a fourth screen for educational use and reducing the seating capacity from 450 to 350 to make it more comfortable, as well as increasing accessibility inside the cinema.

James Rice, who began working in the box office in 2003 before leaving in 2019, said without the funding the future would have been uncertain.

Mr Rice said: ""If we hadn't got the grant, I don't know what the outcome would have been.

""The refit matters because it helps us to attract new people in. We want to try to introduce people to a broader range of cinema.

""The core message is to deliver a full programme, including documentaries and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

""A large proportion of what we do is not screened at other cinemas.

""We have got to this point because of the strength of feeling and support, from letter writing and public meetings. There's some people who worked here who went onto be film-makers.""

Mr Rice said cinema faced new challenges from streaming services and firesticks, but that Edinburgh had seen an increase of 33% turnout in cinemas over the past year compared to 2022.

The Filmhouse described its programme as ""the most ambitious cultural film programme outside the British Film Theatre"" in London's Southbank and also hosted the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years.

Options are being explored regarding pricing, including ""pay what you can"", and efforts are being made to ensure cost is not a barrier to accessibility.

Trustee Ginnie Atkinson said another £800,000 has been raised from donors and philanthropists but described the UK Government funding as ""transformational"".

She said plans were afoot to ""modernise"" amid complaints the original seats did not provide enough space and were threadbare.

Ms Atkinson said: ""This is absolutely transformational. When we applied the amount was aspirational. We have to attract new audiences and make it a modern, comfortable cinema experience.

""Our aspiration is to open on October 6, the two-year anniversary of it closing. We are hoping before Christmas.""

However, she said an opening date could be between six months and a year.

Scotland Office minister Donald Cameron was given a tour of the building and welcomed the funding boost.

He said ""communities"" which benefited included artists, international students and people living outside Edinburgh.

Mr Cameron said: ""It's really important that a facility like this is accessible to everyone. People travel from the Borders to visit. We hope it attracts people from across Scotland.

""We hope the Filmhouse will be able to open again. It is for the local community. I think it's right that the UK Government is funding it.""",news.stv.tv,news,STV News,Christina O'Neill,0.2078431372549019,448886826,1,https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fbe6bd771a19c64034ea84c4a4034c0b-1665086432-social-default.jpg,

The company will pump resources into applied research in the financial hub of Shanghai, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported, citing Cook's comments to Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. He didn't disclose details of the investment, according to the paper.

""We are continuing to invest in China, in the supply chain, in R&D and in our stores,"" Cook said in a video clip of the meeting.

Cook is among a slew of global executives expected to attend the China Development Forum in Beijing starting Sunday. Chinese Premier Li Qiang will deliver a keynote speech at the annual summit, while speculation remains over which top leaders they'll meet. The Apple CEO also opened an expansive new store in central Shanghai on Thursday evening.

The visit comes amid recent signs of Apple struggling in China. Sales of the iPhone fell 24% in the first six weeks of the year, according to independent research. A government ban on iPhones at state agencies and government-backed firms deepened late last year. That's as certain relations between Beijing and Washington continue to sour, with the US recently taking more steps to ringfence and curtail its rival's artificial-intelligence and semiconductor ambitions.

Wang told Cook that China is willing to work with the US to create a fair, stable and predictable business environment for American and Chinese companies, according to a statement from the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday.

To qualify for the exemption, which was initially adopted to boost the availability of capital to issuers in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to expand investment opportunities, investors must self-certify that they meet other criteria intended to demonstrate their financial and investment knowledge.

The kinds of qualifications that investors can rely on to qualify for the exemption include various securities industry designations, undergrad degrees in finance, MBAs, and lawyers with certain financial expertise.

The exemption also carries restrictions designed to limit the risks to investors: it caps investments at $10,000 for a single issuer, and $30,000 across multiple issuers, per year. Those limits don't apply for exchange-traded companies when the investor has also received advice, confirming that the proposed investment is suitable.

The regulators first adopted the self-certification exemption in March 2021 as a three-year pilot program, which was set to expire April 1.

The amendments adopted Friday remove the expiry date and make some other minor changes to the exemption's provisions ""to align more closely with the accredited investor language on which it is based.""

Sales at new car dealers fell 3.0%, while used car dealers gained 4.5%.

The numbers cover a period when Canadians are usually taking stock of holiday spending and sometimes curtailing larger purchases to help them handle credit card payments due for gifts, gatherings and other December festivities.

Despite the drop in overall retail sales, economists said January had a bright spot: core retail sales that came in higher than many of their expectations.

Core retail sales -- which exclude gas stations and fuel vendors, and motor vehicle and parts dealers -- rose 0.4% in the first month of 2024. The rise was largely attributable to higher sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, book, and miscellaneous retailers, which saw a 3.0% increase.

""That points to a solid momentum in spending,"" Maria Solovieva, an economist with TD, wrote in a note to investors.

Some of that momentum is coming from what Solovieva calls a ""wealth effect,"" where recent gains in the financial markets and tepid growth in liabilities have pushed up Canadian households' wealth.

Also fuelling the momentum, she said, is the cost of many goods and services easing. Statistics Canada announced Tuesday that the annual inflation rate fell to 2.8% in February amid sharp declines in cellular and internet services, as well as slower grocery price growth.

Andrew Grantham, a CIBC senior economist, noticed weather is playing a role too.

Some of the increases, including those in sporting goods, building and garden stores, were at least partially attributable to unseasonably warm pockets of weather in several regions in Canada, he said.

""While clothing sales fell in nominal terms, that was driven by lower prices and in volume terms, sales were up on the month,"" Grantham said.

""A further large monthly increase in the volume of sales at gasoline stations is another sign that mild weather may be impacting the latest retail sales figures.""

In volume terms, Statistics Canada said retail sales rose 0.2% in January.

Shelly Kaushik, an economist with BMO, said in her note to clients, ""those higher volumes would support economic growth to start the year.""

Looking ahead, Statistics Canada's advance estimate of retail sales for February suggests sales increased 0.1% for the month, though it cautioned the figure would be revised.

Martini's claim states that in January of this year, Advocis told her she'd be laid off for up to 35 weeks without pay, relying on the terms of her 2023 employment contract to do so.

Martini was appointed COO last year after being employed with Advocis since 2017 in marketing and strategy roles.

The 2023 contract ""purported"" to reflect Martini's promotion to the COO role, the claim states, but Martini had already been working in the role and receiving the remuneration set out in the contract. As a result, Martini pleads that ""the contract is void for want of consideration,"" the claim states.

""Advocis has retained legal counsel, denies the allegations contained in the statement of claim and intends to vigorously defend the claim advanced by Ms. Martini,"" Douglas Smith, counsel for Advocis and partner with Borden Ladner Gervais in Toronto, said in an emailed statement. ""Advocis will not comment further on its dispute with Ms. Martini given that the parties are both represented by legal counsel and the matter is now the subject of a formal legal proceeding.""

Counsel for Martini didn't respond to a request for comment ahead of publication time.

Martini also claims her employment contract contained termination language that violated Ontario's Employment Standards Act, and as such, all termination language in the contract, including temporary layoff language, is void.

""It is submitted that the right to lay off without notice, thereby reducing Julie's income to $0.00 per month, is an extraordinary right that must be found to exist in an enforceable contract, given its obvious conflict with the fundamental obligation of an employer to provide work and pay for it,"" the claim states.

By placing Martini ""on a layoff without her consent and without a contractual right to do so, [Advocis] breached the fundamental terms of the employment agreement between the parties, which amounted to ... constructive termination of her employment,"" the claim states.

Further, the claim says that in constructively terminating Martini, the association provided no notice of termination or pay in lieu.

Martini ""expressly denies that the defendant had cause to terminate her employment without reasonable notice, and puts the defendant to strict proof thereof,"" the claim states.

Martini claims she's entitled to reasonable notice equal to 12 months, based on such factors as her tenure of more than six years, executive position, remuneration, age and ""difficulties present in the marketplace at the time of dismissal for [a] comparable position.""

Martini remains unemployed, ""despite her best efforts,"" the claim states.

In addition to base pay and RRSP contributions, Martini claims compensation for the 12-month notice for group benefits, monthly parking and cell phone allowances, membership fees, and five weeks' annual vacation. Advocis also owed her about 497 hours of banked paid sick time when she was dismissed, the claim alleges.

The claim is the second in recent months that alleges Advocis terminated an employee wrongfully.

Former CEO Pollock alleges he was terminated ""without cause"" and without notice, learning of his termination through a text message from Advocis board chairman Eric Lidemark on Sept. 13, according to a statement of claim filed in December with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Milton, Ont.

Pollock's claim states his employment contract, which was to last until the end of 2026, was breached. He seeks $2.5 million from Advocis, which denies any wrongdoing.

Another claim against Advocis was filed in December by exam-prep company SeeWhy Learning, based in Huntsville, Ont. The company is suing Advocis for an unpaid invoice of nearly $100,000 for study materials for insurance licensing. In a statement of defence, Advocis alleges it is being overcharged.

The three claims come as Advocis has looked to cut costs after expenses exceeded revenues by $2.5 million for the 2022 fiscal year.

The association has faced falling membership, costs to update its education programs and invest in infrastructure, and pandemic-related fallout.

""The financial results of 2022 have put a strain on the financial resources and liquidity of [the association],"" notes to the financial statements said.

The financial statements said that, since year-end 2022, Advocis raised cash by increasing its line of credit to $500,000, arranging a loan of $610,000 against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held, and establishing a $1.7-million line of credit from its Century Initiative Fund (funded with premium membership fees), from which it also received support.

The Century Initiative was created in 2006 to ensure the association's capitalization and is funded with premium membership fees. Its balance was $5.5 million at the end of 2022.

Advocis' 2022 financials said the association was in the process of completing a ""restructuring plan"" to ""reduce operating expenses and provide a sound financial base for the organization.""

Pollock's claim said his base salary was $468,479.55 when he was terminated.

A contact list of executive management in the association's 2022 annual report names Pollock as COO, in addition to president and CEO. At the time, Martini was vice-president of strategic engagement.

Vice-president of operations Linda Illidge left the association in July 2023 after nearly 20 years, based on her LinkedIn profile. Barbara Riddell, vice-president of learning and development, left in December after six years, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Those two positions are no longer part of Advocis' executive, according to the association's website.

In a release last year announcing Martini's appointment as COO, Pollock, as president, said the appointment ""recognizes the outstanding performance that Julie has delivered"" throughout her tenure with the association.

That's left accountants, lawyers and financial advisors hoping their interpretation matches the government's. ""Uncertainty is not good,"" he said.

And because no one has filed a return for a bare trust before this year, few know what qualifies as one.

""If I say we're at a party and I ask you to hold my beer for me, that's a bare trust,"" Oakey joked. (A bare trust is when one person holds the title of something for another person with no beneficial ownership.)

The bare trust uncertainty is just one of many issues that make the Canadian tax system difficult to grasp.

""It's easy to get a consensus around the need for tax reform. It's very difficult to get a consensus around what the reformed tax system should look like,"" said Fred O'Riordan, EY Canada's national leader for tax policy.

Since Canada's last tax reform was enacted in 1972, tax professionals have found ways around each update to the Income Tax Act. Then, amendments intended to close those loopholes further increase the tax system's complexity, O'Riordan said.

""There's so much complexity in the [tax] system that even professionals are more than likely making mistakes,"" Oakey said.

That creates challenges for the average taxpayer. To build a more equitable system, experts say the system needs more simplicity -- and the government should reconsider whether the CRA is best positioned to distribute benefits to vulnerable Canadians.

The CRA used to just be a tax enforcement and collection agency, but its role now includes wealth redistribution as the government relies on the agency to distribute benefit programs, Oakey said. The CRA has grown from 42,000 employees in 2016 to nearly 60,000 in 2024.

""I was alive when you got family allowance checks and they ... had nothing to do with the income tax system,"" said Kim Moody, founder of Calgary-based tax firm Moodys Private Client. ""But they abandoned that and they put it right into the tax system.""

Many vulnerable Canadians miss out on benefits because they are either too intimidated to file taxes or can't afford to pay for professional tax preparation, Moody said. ""The average person right now can't approach a person like me. I'm too expensive, and that's not right. In a perfect world, I wouldn't have a job.""

Even if Canadians file for benefits, they might not get it right. A taxpayer may risk reassessment if they misunderstand a rule, file incorrectly or claim a benefit they didn't qualify for, Oakey said. The CRA is trying to claw back billions that were distributed to people who were ineligible for pandemic-related benefits, for example.

The consequences of filing an incorrect return could include interest on penalties and even imprisonment, said Philip Lawrence, Conservative MP and associate shadow minister for finance and middle class prosperity for tax reform.

Filing for benefits is even more complicated for couples, who face a blended system where each person files individually but benefits are allocated as a family with inconsistent rules, Oakey said. For example, while couples can choose which spouse claims the medical expense tax credit, the childcare credit must be allocated to the lower-income spouse.

""You either go all the way [for individual filing or] make it a family taxation unit,"" Oakey said. ""We're in a much more complicated situation by trying to blend the two of them.""

At the opposite end of the spectrum, high marginal tax rates are disincentivizing productivity. The highest marginal federal/provincial tax rate is more than 50% in all but two provinces.

Shifting government revenue from income taxes to consumption taxes like the GST could help boost productivity, especially as mechanisms such as the GST/HST credit exist to refund a portion of consumption tax to lower-income taxpayers, Moody said.

Lower marginal tax rates also could entice high income earners to stay in Canada rather than relocate to lower-tax jurisdictions, Oakey said.

Jurisdictional concerns also affect tax reform, as consultation with provinces is another complicating factor. Many provincial tax acts make references to the federal income tax act, Oakey said. For example, Ontario's Income Tax Act makes more than 300 references to its federal counterpart.

""You will either want to get the provinces to agree with what you're doing, or you just go alone and then leave the provinces to make whatever corrections they want,"" Oakey said.

But changes don't need to be made in one fell swoop. While O'Riordan said a clean slate approach would be best as incremental improvements will add complexity, Lawrence said some areas can be addressed sooner.

Lawrence believes all 338 MPs are likely to support the idea of tax reform, but urged caution in making big changes. ""The Income Tax Act is thousands of pages deep, so that there are many opportunities to go wrong in tax reform as well,"" he said.",investmentexecutive.com,news,Investment Executive,Jonathan Got,0.1450980392156862,448885580,1,https://www.investmentexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/iStock-92255685.jpg,eng-9411982

The majority and controlling shareholder remains ORG, which manages funds for PSPRS (the Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System), as they still hold a 50 per cent stake.

ORG co-founder and principal Ed Schwartz said on the club's website: ""When we purchased Ipswich Town in 2021, we did so with the initial aim of restoring the club to the Championship and becoming competitive at this level, with the plan always including bringing a partner on board when the time was right.

Ashton is confident the investment from BPSP can help Ipswich push on with their aim of returning to the Premier League.

""This is a day that further secures the long-term future of the football club and gives us the means to move the club forward as we benefit from the wide range of skills and experiences Bright Path's investors will bring,"" Ashton said.

Being at the official launch of Warrington's brand new zero emission electric bus fleet last week, we saw a glimpse of a much improved public transport network serving everyone in Warrington from this summer.

It's the culmination of four years of hard work and one of the largest bus investments in the North of England, a £21.5 million pot of funding received from the Conservative Government alongside the new depot made possible with additional Government money as part of the Town Deal Fund.

Add to that a further £20 million from Government to fund increased services at weekends and into the evening as well as the introduction of new routes and a cap on fares of £2 for adult fares and £1 for children and young people.

The rollout of our new bus fleet represents yet another milestone in the transport investment being put into both our area and across the North of England. Anyone who drives or uses public transport in the town recognises the challenges that we face on our roads, whether that's as a result of delays caused by the Ship Canal swing bridges, potholes or traffic jams.

Our geography is a key factor on why we are so heavily reliant on our transport network.

Sitting halfway between Manchester and Liverpool means many people commute to work in those areas daily by rail or by road, and also explains why it's the logistics sector that is one of the largest employers in Warrington.

The decision to cancel the remaining stages of HS2 has had a major impact on Government thinking around the type of investment Warrington needs to upgrade our transport infrastructure to make it fit for the future. The Department for Transport have made clear that every single penny earmarked for HS2 in the North and midlands will be put into other projects in the North and the Midlands, as part of Network North.

We've already had confirmation of £120 million allocation for transport infrastructure for the next few years in Warrington, which gives the Highways Authority the chance to deal with junction improvements and wider road network. There's also a commitment of £33 million to Warrington Borough Council to spend on pothole repairs and improvements to pavements.

In the coming weeks we could have confirmation that Warrington will be included on the high-speed East-West train line between Liverpool and Manchester via Manchester Airport. It would mean a new low level station at Bank Quay which would link Northern Powerhouse Rail to the West Coast Mainline. That station would be a catalyst for further private sector funding to regenerate the area around Warrington Bank Quay, creating jobs and opportunity for people locally.

But the funding cutoff was brief and technical, having had no significant impact, with the White House saying it had ""ceased preparations for closure"" due to a Senate agreement, which came after Republicans demanded the vote on a series of amendments.

The bill, which passed the House Friday morning by a vote of 268 to 134, now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. It ends a turbulent government funding process during divided government, characterized by a year of horse-trading, six months of stopgap bills and intense partisan clashes over money and policy along the way.

Once Biden signs the package, the government as a whole will be funded through the end of September, after Congress passed a previous $459 billion tranche of money earlier this month. The total level of spending for the fiscal year is $1.659 billion.

Nothing is easy these days, Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, told NBC News after midnight as the Senate voted, but said it was important that Congress pass the 12 appropriations bills in a year.

Given the dysfunction in the House and the slim majorities here, you know, there's something to be said that we finally got it done, Murphy said.

The new tranche will fund the departments of State, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security, among other parts of the government that had not yet been fully funded.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said it was typical and juvenile for the Senate to wait until the 11th hour to act on the bill.

Earlier Friday, the Senate indicated it had enough support to move the bill across the finish line following a 78-18 procedural vote that moved the measure forward. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced just before the deadline that the two parties had reached an agreement to vote on several amendments and then for final passage of the bill early Saturday Morning.

""This has been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to finish the job of financing the government,"" Schumer announced to the Senate shortly before midnight. ""It's a good thing for the country that we reached this bipartisan agreement.""

The divided Congress narrowly avoided multiple shutdowns this session, passing four stopgap bills that continued to extend the deadline. And almost six months after the start of the financial year, it is unusually late to haggle over financing measures. The latest bill was released Thursday and passed the House Friday morning, leaving little time for the Senate to act.

For a time, those talks appeared to collapse midday Friday, with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing the deal had been scuttled by vulnerable Democrats in key Senate races saying they didn't want to not have to vote on amendments that could be used against them in their re-election campaigns.

Ultimately, Democratic senators up for reelection are afraid to vote on the amendments, Cotton told reporters, adding without providing evidence: Jon Tester said he would rather the government shut down and vote Sunday night rather than voting on these amendments for you.

But Tester, a Democrat in a tight re-election race in the red state of Montana that could determine the Senate majority, fired back, telling NBC News: ""It's bull...""

The exchanges came to a head when the two senators were speaking to different groups of journalists just meters apart from each other in the Senate.

Did Cotton say they were holding back amendments because of Jon Tester? The tester yelled at Cotton during the exchange. Because if he did, he might be full of something that comes out of a cow's back.

Senators were frustrated that Congress repeatedly managed to avoid funding lapses in this fiscal year alone, but struggled to do so in this fiscal year's final year.

It makes me sick, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said in an interview, adding that she felt like she ate too much sugar and bad pizza after Senate Republicans saw each other serve these dishes for lunch.

""If we had eaten salmon, we would have thought twice because it's like we're getting all these good omega 3s,"" she said. We were like a candy pizza mess, functioning like teenagers.

Real estate has long been a cornerstone of wealth creation, offering the potential for steady income, capital appreciation, and long-term security. However, navigating the real estate market can be complex, and success hinges on implementing well-defined strategies. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting, this guide explores some of the most innovative strategies to maximize your chances of real estate investment success.

Education is Key

Real estate investment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Before venturing in, arm yourself with knowledge. Research market trends, understand different property types (residential, commercial, etc.), and familiarize yourself with legal and financial aspects. You should consider taking real estate investment courses or attending workshops to gain valuable insights.

Craft a Clear Investment Plan

Don't enter the market blindly. Develop a well-defined investment plan outlining your goals (cash flow, appreciation, portfolio diversification), risk tolerance, budget, and investment timeline. Your plan should consider factors like property location, target renters/occupants, and potential exit strategies (selling the property or refinancing).

Secure Financing Options

Financing is the lifeblood of most real estate investments. Explore different loan options, such as traditional mortgages, hard money loans, and private lenders. Carefully evaluate interest rates, loan terms, and down payment requirements to choose the financing solution that aligns with your investment plan and financial situation.

Location, Location, Location

This age-old adage holds in real estate. Location significantly impacts a property's value and rental potential. Research neighborhoods with strong rental markets, job growth, and positive development trends. Consider factors like proximity to amenities, transportation infrastructure, and crime rates.

Conduct Thorough Due Diligence

Before committing to a property, conduct thorough due diligence. This involves a detailed inspection for structural integrity, potential repairs, and any code violations. You should also review property taxes, historical rental income (if applicable), and potential future development plans in the area.

Analyze Market Trends and Understand Risks

The real estate market is cyclical. Stay informed about current trends and potential economic factors impacting your investment. Understand the risks involved, such as vacancy periods, property damage, and unexpected maintenance costs. Develop strategies to mitigate these risks, such as building an emergency repair fund and having renter's insurance.

Invest in the Right Property Type

Different property types cater to varying investment goals. Residential rentals offer consistent cash flow, while commercial properties might provide higher returns but require more management involvement. Consider your risk tolerance, budget, and desired level of involvement when choosing a property type.

Consider Value-Add Opportunities

Look for properties with the potential for value addition. This could involve strategic renovations, upgrades, or improvements to increase rental income or resale value. However, carefully evaluate the cost of renovations and ensure they align with your budget and potential return on investment.

Negotiate Like a Pro

Don't be afraid to negotiate the purchase price of a property. Research comparable properties in the area to understand fair market value. Hire a real estate agent with strong negotiation skills to represent you and ensure you get the best possible deal.

Build a Strong Team of Professionals

Surround yourself with a team of qualified professionals. This may include a real estate agent, property manager, tax advisor, and lawyer. These experts can provide valuable guidance throughout the investment process, helping you make informed decisions and navigate legal and financial hurdles.

Be Patient and Play the Long Game

Real estate is a long-term investment. Don't expect overnight windfalls. Focus on building a solid portfolio that appreciates over time and generates consistent income.

Practice Active Management

Don't be a passive investor. Be proactive in managing your properties. Maintain regular communication with tenants, address maintenance issues promptly, and stay updated on market trends to ensure your investments remain competitive.

Continuously Learn and Adapt

The real estate market is constantly evolving. Stay curious about new trends, regulations, and investment strategies. Be willing to adapt your approach as necessary to navigate changing market conditions.

Diversify Your Portfolio

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your real estate portfolio across different locations, property types, and risk profiles can help mitigate risk and ensure long-term financial stability.

By following these innovative strategies and prioritizing thorough research, calculated planning, and a proactive approach, you can increase your chances of success in real estate investment. Remember, real estate offers a path toward financial security and wealth creation, but it requires dedication, continuous learning, and a commitment to making sound investment decisions. So, take the first step today, equip yourself with knowledge, and embark on your journey towards real estate investment success.",rollingout.com,news,Rolling Out,,0.411764705882353,448885109,1,https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2.-fizkes.jpg,

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans said Democrats had rejected their requests for votes on several amendments on border security and other issues. Any successful amendments to the bill would send the legislation back to the House, which has already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill at issue Friday is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The White House said it had a ""high degree of confidence"" the package would pass and President Joe Biden would sign it Saturday.

The House had approved the package of spending bills earlier Friday, a long overdue action nearly six months into the budget year that would push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall.

The House passed the bill by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

On Thursday, the Ontario government announced they were adding an additional $625 million to that fund, which had about $200 million in it. The money is to upgrade or advance municipal water systems.

The city says they want to use the funding to build new water-related infrastructure for a new subdivision set to be built at Beaver Creek Road and Conservation Drive that would provide about 2500 new homes. The infrastructure would also allow for further developments in that area.

Municipalities have until April 19, 2024 to submit an application. The province is only allowing one application per municipality and work should be finished by 2027.

Brad Witzel, the director of financial planning and asset management for the City of Waterloo said Waterloo only met about 60 per cent of their housing target for last year. This new infrastructure would provide a boost to help meet their overall target of adding 16,000 new homes by 2031.

""The projects need to be completed within about 3 years, this was the one project that was far enough along in the process it would have that size to fully leverage the grant opportunity to the maximum value of $35 million,"" said Witzel.

""It is from staff's perspective an aggressive timeline, but one we feel we can accomplish and were certainly excited about the opportunity to hopefully leverage these funds from the province.""

Witzel added the city needs to install all the infrastructure for that area which includes installing water, wastewater, storm water, pipes, a stormwater management facility and pumping stations.

""We would encourage the province when they release this budget and future budgets, these are the types of programs that are really impactful for municipalities to be able to access to get this critical infrastructure into the ground.""

The city is estimating that the whole project will amount to more than $70 million to complete.

Ten per cent of the support will be directed for strengthening the organisation's oversight activities.

Finland suspended its annual five million euro payment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in January due to the alleged links to the Hamas terrorist group. In February, Finland allocated corresponding support of EUR 5 million through International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Food Programme (WFP). At the end of last year, Finland also granted EUR 4 million for relieving the suffering of civilians in Gaza.

Finland has received information on the two different UN investigations concerning UNRWA. In addition, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has commissioned a separate assessment, which was recently completed. The information received indicates that there are clear shortcomings in the UNRWA's risk management, which are related for example to the use of funds and facilities.

The allegations concerning support for terrorism are serious. The findings of the assessments have been discussed with the UNRWA, but a final report on the alleged links to Hamas terrorism has yet to be produced.

UNRWA has given Finland a bilateral assurance that misconduct will be tackled with enhanced effectiveness. It has provided similar assurances to the European Commission and Sweden, among others.

UNRWA's assurance to improve risk management by preventing and closely overseeing misconduct gives us at this point the necessary guarantees that risks will be managed and we can continue our support. Therefore, the payment of this year's funding to the UNRWA will proceed,"" says Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Ville Tavio.

""We will allocate ten per cent of the funds, EUR 500,000, to risk management. This money is used to monitor the implementation of guidelines on misconduct. In future, we will also require annual bilateral consulatations with Finland on the progress of stepping up risk management,"" Minister Tavio says.

Finland will continue to monitor closely the review processes related to UNRWA in cooperation with other countries.

""I am particularly looking forward to the final report of the UN Office for Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). It is of crucial importance for Finland to ensure that our funds will not support terrorism. However, the preparation of the report will take time, and UNRWA cannot in the short term be replaced in Gaza by other humanitarian agencies,"" Minister Tavio says.

Now mines threaten their water, culture and wealth","TUSAQUILLAS, Argentina -- Irene Leonor Flores de Callata, 68, treks along a bone-dry riverbed, guiding a herd of llamas and sheep through stretching desert.

Flores de Callata's native Kolla people have spent centuries climbing deep into the mountains of northern Argentina in search of a simple substance: Fresh drinking water.

Here, in one of the most arid environments in the world, it's a life force that underpins everything.

But communities like hers increasingly worry that their luck may run out. That's because the parched waterways surrounding their town are intrinsically connected with spanning white salt flats below, subterranean lagoons with waters jam-packed with a material that's come to be known as ""white gold"": lithium.

In the ""lithium triangle"" -- a region spanning Argentina, Chile and Bolivia - native communities sit upon a treasure trove of the stuff: an estimated trillion dollars in lithium.

The metal is key in the global fight against climate change, used in electric car batteries, crucial to solar and wind energy and more. But to extract it, mines suck water out of the flats, tethered to the lives of thousands of communities like Flores de Callata's.

As the world's most powerful increasingly look toward the Triangle, the largest reserve of lithium on Earth, as a crucial puzzle piece to save the environment, others worry the search for the mineral will mean sacrificing that very life force that has sustained the region's native people for centuries.

""We will lose everything,"" said Flores de Callata. ""What will we do if we don't have water? If the mines come, we'll lose our culture, we won't be left with anything.""

Between 2021 and 2023, the price for one ton of lithium in U.S. markets nearly tripled, reaching a high of $46,000 a ton last year, according to a United States Geological Survey report. In China, the main customer of the region's lithium, a ton of the metal went for a whopping $76,000 at its peak last year.

While prices have since dipped, leaders, mining executives and companies from across the world began to turn their heads. From the U.S. and China, they looked to the region's barren deserts both as a source of wealth and an engine to power the transition to green energy.

The ""white gold"" they seek is contained in the hundreds of salt flats, or salares, speckling the region.

From afar, they look like fields of Arctic snow, but below are deep wells of salted groundwater packed with minerals. Unlike other forms of mining, lithium here is extracted not from rock, but rather from the brine water pumped from the salt flats.

The problem is that the salt flats also act as an essential part of a highly biodiverse ecosystem, say scientists like Ingrid Garcés, a hydrologist from Chile's University of Antofagasta.

While the water inside the lagoons is not drinkable, they are tethered to surrounding fresh water sources, sparse rains and nearby mountain streams, essential for the survival of thousands of Indigenous communities.

The concern by scientists interviewed by the AP is that industrial-scale water pumping both contaminates fresh water with brine they pump and effectively dries up the surrounding environment. They say it's produced cascading ripple effects for life in the region at a time it's already been hit by climate change-induced drought.

Because of their environmental significance, the salt flats and their surrounding waters have gained a sacred place for Indigenous cultures, an essential part of native celebrations the entire month of August.

Flores de Callata's town is one of 38 pressed up against two such salt flats -- the Guayatayoc lagoon and Salinas Grandes -- which bring income to towns like hers through tourism and small-scale salt harvesting.

For decades, their communities have fought off large-scale mining and waged long legal battles to halt projects.

But year by year, it's grown more difficult to fend off those mining companies.

More than 30 companies are officially seeking permission to mine the water in the two salt flats. Signs put up by the community line the edges of the flats reading, ""Respect our territory. Get out, lithium company.""

""We are guardians of the highlands,"" said Flores de Callata. ""We defend our land. ... I'm worried not just for myself but for all of us. If the lithium (mines) come it's going to affect the entire region, all of the waterways by extension.""

Things came to a head last summer when the local government, eager for the profits by the mines, changed its constitution, making it easier to waive certain Indigenous land rights and limiting the ability to protest against the expansion of mining.

Alicia Chalabe, the environmental lawyer representing the communities, and others argue the move violates international law.

Thousands of indigenous people erupted in protest, blocking off roadways used by lithium mines and carrying rainbow Indigenous flags.

Doors for the mining companies have been left wide open under the country's new right-wing ""anarcho-capitalist"" leader Javier Milei, who was elected in November, under a promise to fix his country's spiraling economy.

The chainsaw-wielding leader announced a broad deregulation sweep, slashing costs for mining companies in an effort to lure investors amid deepening economic crisis. Milei's rise to power will likely further hamstring already fraught efforts by Indigenous communities to beat back mining companies.

For Flores de Callata and her small town of Tusaquillas, the mounting interest in their home represents another nightmare scenario.

She wonders what will be left in 20 years.

""If the mines come, we'll have money for a time. But then our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren -- they're the ones who will suffer,"" she said. ""I want to do everything possible to defend these lands, so they still have these fields, so they still have their waters.""

Though passage was not in doubt, Republicans and Democrats were at odds over votes on proposed amendments in exchange for expediting a final vote.

Republicans said Friday evening that they had proposed several amendments on border security and other issues, but that Democrats had rejected those votes during hours of talks. Any successful amendments to the bill would send the legislation back to the House, which has already left town for a two-week recess.

""Right now, it doesn't look good,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said after emerging from talks on the Senate floor.

The practical impact of a funding lapse in the near term would likely be minimal, with federal offices closed for the weekend and many government services funded through earlier legislation. Still, there could be varying impacts on the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies that would see a lapse in funds -- especially if the disagreements drag into Monday.

The White House Office of Management and Budget typically sends out guidance to agencies ahead of any potential funding lapse.

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill at issue Friday is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House had approved the package of spending bills earlier Friday, a long overdue action nearly six months into the budget year that would push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall.

The House passed the bill by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70 percent of the money would go to defense.

The vote in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It's taken lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24 percent increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""But at the end of the day this is a bill that will keep our country and our families moving forward.""

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on the Senate to pass the spending bill as quickly as possible.

""This bill is a compromise,"" she said. ""No side got everything it wanted.""

The spending in the bill largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

""Raising the debate around currency right now causes jitters among investors. Tomorrow, investors are going to wait and see before investing,"" Ba told journalists in Dakar. ""Our economic and social situation does not allow us to create these kinds of uncertainty.""

Ba, 62, is facing 18 other candidates in Senegal's presidential election on Sunday. No frontrunner has emerged, but the opposition has seen strong momentum behind Bassirou Diomaye Faye, a 43-year-old former tax inspector.

Faye is supported by firebrand opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, and on Friday received the endorsement of Senegal's former President Abdoulaye Wade and his Senegalese Democratic Party.

Faye has said he will first seek monetary reforms within the eight-nation West African Monetary Union that use the CFA franc. If that fails, he will push for a national currency.

Ba said he would rather seek a monetary union of the 15-nation West African regional bloc. ""Our currency is convertible and stable, and inflation has been moderate compared with countries with their own currencies,"" he said.

Responding to former Wade's endorsement of Faye, Ba said he would continue to reach out to supporters of the Senegalese Democratic Party.

Faye's campaign has drawn widespread support from Senegal's disaffected youth who face high unemployment in a country where the median age is 19.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

Congress approved the bill with a Senate vote after midnight, avoiding a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise President Joe Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.",thefrontierpost.com,news,The Frontier Post,,0.3254901960784313,448882866,1,https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23131624728069a-1.jpg,

The history of the crypto market is rife with examples of presale projects that turned out to be a roaring success generating huge returns for early investors. Among these, the Ethereum presale of 2014 stands out as a landmark event. A select group of investors gained early access to Ether tokens at a discounted rate of $0.31 per ETH. Imagine how lucky these savvy investors were to snatch up this undervalued crypto gem and turn their modest investments into fortunes.

The crypto market is notorious for high volatility, but presale projects stand out as a beacon of predictability, as their price is pinned to a certain level until they get listed on a DEX. So, they are immune to market fluctuations.

The second reason is the low price. As in the Ethereum example above, its presale price was exponentially lower than its post-listing price. Similarly, most emerging projects aim to raise some capital, so they try to attract investors with highly favourable offers.

A myriad of emerging projects are vying for investors' attention. The competition is fierce, but certain contenders with a strong concept and high utility clearly stand out. Unlike many junk tokens, such as meme coins, whose value is based solely on the hype around them, the projects with real practical use have a more solid foundation.

BlastUP is the first launchpad on the Blast blockchain, a unique Layer 2 solution offering a native yield of 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. This groundbreaking approach has made Blast quite popular, and it has already attracted a huge army of fans, hitting a $1 billion in TLV in just one month. Moreover, the recent launch of the Blast Mainnet has pushed it to the top 10 projects in terms of TLV. Being a part of such a robust ecosystem, BlastUP is already ticking the boxes for its reliability.

The presale of BlastUP tokens ($BLP) is currently running, and buying them now could be compared with investing in ETH during its presale. The current BLP value is pinned at merely 5 US cents, while its listing price is set at $0.1, which already makes a 50% ROI.

Hop on the bandwagon! Hurry to join BlastUP

Those who buy BlastUP tokens at the presale stage get access to exclusive early benefits including participation in an Airdrop to get free $BLP tokens. The utility of BlastUP tokens spreads far and wide, offering its users access to:

Moreover, $BLP holders get Booster Points, special tokens that BlastUP is launching to support the community. Booster Point is a fuel for the Community Incentives Program (CIP) intended for the creation of a solid base for launching projects and making them successful.

In just one month, BlastUP has attracted over $2.5 million in investments, which speaks much for its wide recognition. The presale runs until the end of May, so it's not too late to buy a possible crypto gem at the best price.

As a committed participant within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP plays an integral role in fostering mutual growth and progress. Recently, it has established strategic alliances with other esteemed members of the Blast family, marking a significant milestone - the highly anticipated launch of the Blast Mainnet.

The partnerships with Blast Alpha, Blastopedia, and Blast Ecosystem not only emphasize BlastUP's dedication to community development but also showcase its commitment to delivering captivating experiences for its users through entertaining contests. These recent collaborations have the potential to enhance the visibility and reputation of BlastUP.

BlastUP is more than a sound investment opportunity; it is a catalyst for creating a rewarding environment for DApp launches. Embracing a motto ""Grow faster, earn more,"" BlastUP is steadfast in its commitment to bolstering the success of blockchain startups. Central to its strategy is the Launchpad Accelerator crafted to provide startup teams with comprehensive documentation and refined tokenomics, thereby smoothing the path for effective capital raising.

At the core of BlastUP's ethos is an uncompromising focus on security. Through its rigorous Project Screening, the platform ensures admission is reserved exclusively for the most trustworthy projects, thus safeguarding the integrity of its entire ecosystem. This commitment to security cements BlastUP's reputation as the premier destination for those seeking dependability.

Moving forward, BlastUP is set to revolutionize startup launches on the Blast network by leveraging AI and Web3 technologies. Its 2026 strategic roadmap reveals ambitious plans, such as an AI-enhanced IDO screener, dedicated tools for AI-enabled startup teams, and the launch of an interactive Community Marketplace. This firm commitment highlights BlastUP's focus on advancing its ecosystem's potential and leading the way in blockchain innovation.

The volatile yet lucrative landscape of cryptocurrency investments presents notable opportunities akin to the storied Ethereum presale of 2014. In this context, BlastUP stands out as an investment of note, offering potential gains through its ongoing $BLP token presale.

BlastUP is not just another crypto project, it stands as a harbinger of progressive blockchain utility and investment value. Within the burgeoning Blast ecosystem, BlastUP's strategic position is unmistakable. Investors aligning with BlastUP are investing in a vision that champions technological innovation, community synergy, and sustained growth, heralding a new chapter in blockchain evolution poised for success.",coinpedia.org,news,Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide,Pr Manager,0.2,448882860,1,http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23145741/crypto-bull-1.webp,

The Bank of Canada has indicated that it will cut its overnight lending rate three to five times this year. It's a certainty that condominium prices will start increasing immediately after the first announcement, says Diane Bertolin, partner at Alliance United Corporation, a developer with over 30 years of collective experience.

The central bank's rate cuts will likely begin in June. If five cuts do indeed occur, that will most likely bring its overnight lending rate to 3.75 per cent -- which also means that condo prices could start increasing as early as July, making now the ideal time to purchase a condominium.

""There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and condo pricing because vertical homes are the affordable alternative to single-family homes, which sell for more than $1 million, in the Greater Toronto Area. That means, according to historical trends, condo prices will increase as interest rates reduce,"" Bertolin said.

Canada's central bank had previously cut its policy rate in the wake of the 2009 recession to around 100 basis points, and then lowered it even more to 0.25 per cent as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the economy.

However, there have been 10 rate increases over the past 24 months, bringing the bank's overnight lending rate to five per cent.

The imminent rate cuts mean now is the best time for investors to consider purchasing a condominium. One such opportunity is the highly anticipated Bronte Lakeside Residences, a six-storey, 203-suite mid-rise condo building coming to Oakville's waterfront Bronte neighbourhood.

The new condominium is currently in the pre-construction phase, meaning the units are now priced lower than they'll ever be once construction begins.

The condominium represents an investment opportunity, especially as the GTA remains one of Canada's most sought out places to rent. Oakville in particular has seen a lot of young couples and single professionals move in over the past several years.

The town's charming Bronte neighbourhood, just steps away from the waterfront, has proven to be a hit with empty nesters who had been homeowners for decades and now want to enjoy a simple, low-maintenance lifestyle in retirement or semi-retirement. Many of the area's renters are also single empty nesters who have no desire of once again becoming homeowners.

There are several reasons that Bronte has been attracting many new residents recently: its abundance of nearby shops and restaurants, popular landmarks, the recreational aspect associated with living close to the lake, and Oakville's generally strong economy, to name just a few.

The location's appeal is expected to help investors capitalize on a strong rental market by commanding exceptional rates, all the while capitalizing on a mortgage market that's moving in the right direction.

TACFI is designed to ""bridge the capability gap"" between current Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) efforts to facilitate the delivery of strategic capabilities for the Department of the Air Force. Reliable was competitively chosen for award from a large list of providers during the funding evaluation.

""The TACFI Program is a valuable funding mechanism to bolster SBIR projects and its application to autonomy development unlocks significant product acceleration, maturation and demonstration of operationally relevant mission sets,"" said Lt Col Bryan Ralston, Autonomy Prime Branch Chief. ""Autonomy is a key enabler for future military tactical air dominance and forward basing operations.""

TACFI selection and Reliable's follow-on Phase III SBIR contract both extend and continue Reliable's previous Phase II contract. These contract efforts will further Reliable's ongoing collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and AFWERX which includes:

""TACFI funding is an important milestone signifying our autonomous flight system is moving forward toward operational implementation,"" said Dr. David O'Brien, Major General (Ret.), and Senior Vice President of Government Solutions at Reliable Robotics. ""Reliable is laser-focused on U.S. leadership in aviation and delivering the Air Force unrivaled automation capabilities for multiple aircraft types within existing inventory, in reduced crew, and crewless modes to defeat any threat, at any time, anywhere on earth.""

Reliable's Dual-use Autonomous Flight System

Reliable Robotics has developed a dual-use solution to convert existing commercial airframes such as the Cessna 208B Caravan with autonomous flight systems, which can be configured for logistics and defense purposes. Automated aircraft, specifically cargo aircraft, provide mission-critical opportunities that can increase aircraft utilization, operational range, and save military lives, while improving the pilot pipeline, and facilitating new operating concepts that could enhance survivability in contested airspace. The USAF and other military branches will be able to take advantage of autonomy at fractional pricing compared to technology developed exclusively for the military.

Reliable's certification progress of a full aircraft automation system is unparalleled with FAA acceptance of its certification plan in June 2023, and all requirements for the advanced aircraft navigation and autopilot systems agreed upon in February 2024. Reliable and the FAA have also established agreement on the testing and analysis that will be performed to show that these highly automated systems satisfy FAA safety and performance requirements. With FAA approval, Reliable Robotics demonstrated operation of two different aircraft types in civilian airspace with no pilot onboard in 2019 and 2023.

The House's 286-134 vote sends the measure to the Democratic-majority Senate, which has hours to act ahead of a midnight deadline (0400 GMT Saturday) when parts of the Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department to Treasury and State departments would begin to close.

The move marks a critical step toward ending a more-than-six-month battle over the scope of Washington's spending for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Ratings agencies have warned that the repeated brinkmanship could hurt the creditworthiness of a federal government that currently has more than $34.6 trillion in debt.

The measure passed the House with 185 Democrats and 101 Republican votes, which led hardline conservative Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to introduce a measure to oust Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson himself ascended to that role in October after hardliners furious that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, had passed a temporary funding measure over their objections, ousted him as leader.

According to the research seen by Nairametrics, Guy Czartoryski, Head of Research at Coronation said that the record of the Nigerian government in capital expenditure over several decades underscores the need to increase private-sector investment.

The report noted that during the period 1981-90, the Federal Government's capital expenditure on average amounted to 3.6% of GDP.

This according to the infrastructure report, rose to a respectable 5.2% during the period 1991-2000, But during the period 2001-2010, the average halved to 2.5%, an extraordinary reversal given the oil price boom that started in 2002 and lasted well into 2014, with the price of Brent frequently trading at over US$100/bbl. Inflows of petro-dollars into government coffers did not translate into proportionately more being spent on capital expenditure, surely a missed opportunity.

It noted that in some cases, the models are built on a lengthy wish list of projects to be completed at current prices, in other cases a sophisticated calculation tracks what projects have been completed elsewhere in comparable circumstances and what their net present values are.

The report noted that Nigeria is ripe for increasing private investment in infrastructure adding that the trend in government investment in infrastructure has fallen short over several decades, something that has created, cumulatively, an enormous deficit as infrastructure fails to meet the country's needs.

Ryan Attard, who served as former County Executive Steve Bellone's chief of staff, in January was named vice president and chief operating officer of the Family & Children's Association, a Garden City health and human services nonprofit.

During her time at Suffolk, Attard was Bellone's designee on the opioid-settlement committee and a news release from the Family & Children's Association announcing her appointment says she developed the process for applying for opioid settlement money from the county.

A Feb. 2, 2023, county resolution announcing the first round of awardees shows the Family & Children's Association was approved for two grants to be awarded over three years, totaling $1,877,967.

Spokespersons for the Family & Children's Association, a respected institution with a 140-year history, noted that Attard was appointed to her post at the association in January, a month after she left the county and nearly a year after the award.

But the award and Attard's subsequent appointment have drawn the scrutiny of the administration of Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine, whose spokesman, Michael Martino, said Romaine ""has ordered a thorough review of the opioid grant application and consideration process."" He declined to elaborate.

Although state law requires that all public bodies take minutes of meetings and record votes, there were no minutes taken of opioid committee meetings and no votes recorded, county officials said.

A committee formed in 2021 to set priorities for disbursing the fund was closed to the public, Newsday reported, and a county spokeswoman at the time declined to say why.

Jon Kaiman, who served as a deputy county executive under Bellone, said in an email last week that funding decisions were reached through consensus and, ""There was, therefore, no formal committee voting process.""

He described Attard's role on the committee as ""ministerial, as she coordinated the information being reviewed by the committee.""

Suffolk County Comptroller John Kennedy said he has questions about Attard's appointment, as well as those of other former county employees, including Bellone, who is now a vice president for Northwell Health. Northwell received the largest grant award from the county fund.

In a Jan. 17 news release announcing Attard's appointment, the Family & Children's Association noted that she ""created and launched an application process that would allow the county to transparently and fairly allocate over $50 million in settlement funding"" from several ""landmark court victories against opioid manufacturers.""

In February 2023, the Family & Children's Association was awarded $1.3 million for treatment and prevention ($433,989 per year over three years), and another $576,000 ($192,000 per year over three years) for treatment.

Family & Children's Association president and chief executive officer Jeffrey Reynolds, in a statement in response to Newsday's questions, said it is ""not at all uncommon for people leaving government to look to continue their public service in the nonprofit sector -- and quite frankly, that should be celebrated, not criticized.""

Reynolds said Attard ""competed with over a hundred applicants for the position, participated in multiple interviews, and was chosen by a committee of staff, executives, and board members.""

At the Family & Children's Association, Attard oversees the agency's program operations, information technology, compliance and quality assurance. The association says it helps more than 35,000 Long Islanders with family health services.

The agency's 2021 contributions and grants totaled just over $15.3 million, down from $16.4 million the year before. Total expenses in 2021 were $21.2 million. Total salaries were $1.2 million, with $195,490 in ""other"" pay.

FCA spokeswoman Kim Como noted that Attard was offered the job in January, after she had left the county, and began at FCA in February.

Como said Attard ""will be recusing herself from any subsequent funding that we apply for from Suffolk County.""

Kennedy called issues surrounding Attard's new role ""disturbing"" and an apparent violation of the county ethics code. ""This is like first-year ethics,"" said Kennedy, who is an attorney.

Suffolk's ethic's code contains post-employment restrictions that stipulate: ""No public servant shall solicit, negotiate for, or accept employment with any firm which is involved in business dealings with the county while such public servant is directly concerned with or personally participating in those business dealings on behalf of the county.""

Kennedy said he was disturbed by what he called a pattern of former Suffolk officials who have gone to work for entities that have received funding from the county. Those officials include Bellone at Northwell Health; ex-Deputy County Executive Vanessa Baird-Streeter, who works for the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, and former Information Technology Commissioner Scott Mastellon, who works for SVAM International.

None of the former Suffolk executives, nor the agencies they work for, has been accused of any wrongdoing, and officials have denied conflicts of interest or filed recusal letters keeping their new employers at arms-length in dealing with the county.

""This is more than coincidence,"" Kennedy said. ""This appears to be a pattern of conduct and behavior that raises concern across the board.""

Bellone, who recently was appointed assistant vice president of operations for Northwell Health, which itself received more than $3.4 million in county funding in 2023, in a statement Friday said Attard ""was not required to file a recusal form when applying for the position with FCA, which posted in December, because she was not personally or directly dealing with FCA at that time.""

As for his own position at Northwell, he said taking the post ""did not require submission of a recusal form because I was not personally or directly dealing with Northwell Health or personally involved in any of their business dealings as a County official at the time.""

Bellone said in his new role at Northwell, ""I am committed to remaining in full compliance with all applicable conflict rules for Suffolk County.""

He called Suffolk's opioid funding process ""a model for the state,"" and added, ""My hope is that the new administration will continue to ensure these funds are dedicated to the agencies directly involved in prevention, treatment and recovery.""

Como said the FCA has ""engaged council to review internal policy and the county laws to ensure we're avoiding any conflict of interest.""

Further, Como noted that Reynolds ""signs all contracts,"" and that Attard's role is ""purely one of internal operations. We've reached that decision to avoid any conflict of interest.""

In addition to serving as deputy county executive, Attard also had served as Bellone's chief of staff and as assistant to the commissioner of the Department of Health Services. She previously worked for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, according to her online resume. In 2023, Attard made $176,770, according to county records.

Attard's new appointment doesn't mention her salary, but in federal tax filings from 2021, the most recent year they are available, the Family & Children's Association's former chief operating officer, Lisa Burch, reported a salary of $165,427, with ""other"" pay listed as $29,566, for total compensation of $194,993. (Reynolds in 2021 made $325,205 in compensation and $65,962 in ""other"" pay, according to public records.)

Katherine Heaviside, a spokeswoman for the association, said Attard took a ""significant"" pay cut from her county salary to work for FCA. She and Como declined to release Attard's salary.

Attard, in a statement, said, ""Throughout my career I have worked in government, been an advocate, and volunteered at many nonprofits. Public service is my passion, and it was important to me that my next role continue that same path.""

Legis. Jason Richberg (D-Wyandanch), who as minority leader served on the committee that awarded opioid funds, said each committee member went through the applications. ""No one strong-armed anyone,"" he said.

""We wanted to make sure that we got the money out to organizations that we knew had been doing the work for a long time,"" Richberg said.

Como noted FCA ""has held contracts with Suffolk since before Ryan was born. Given FCA's leadership role in fighting the opioid crisis and our impeccable record, we would have been surprised and disappointed had we not been one of the 34 awardees in the first funding round.""

Como said FCA was ""disappointed that neither of our applications were approved"" in the second round of opioid funding awards last year.",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,0.3568627450980393,448881711,1,https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:NjczMDVjZDktMTExYi00:YTY1YzJl/landscape/1280,

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation on Friday. It addresses funding for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch through this fiscal year.

The White House stated earlier that shutdown preparations have ended and that U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" said the statement.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session thanks to stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

""A failure to fund the government tonight means everyone loses, and everyone loses a lot,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told reporters on Friday. ""There's no winner to come out of a catastrophe like failing to fund the government.""

The U.S. Congress appropriates funds for federal agencies to operate each fiscal year. Without signed appropriations or a continuing resolution, federal agencies must ease normal spending, described as a ""shutdown."" The duration and reasons for shutdowns vary, but they often stem from disagreements between the two political parties over budgetary matters or policy issues.

Three in four Americans said it is not acceptable for members of Congress to threaten a government shutdown during budget negotiations to achieve their goals, according to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll last year.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.05098039215686279,448881309,1,,

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

But landlords complain that the renting landscape has been rendered far more challenging in recent years, thanks to changes to the tax regime that reduce rental returns and increasing regulation.

Meanwhile, there is a shinier, sexier real estate investment option on the block - holiday lets, which can earn far more on a night-by-night basis with the added perk of being a ""free"" bolthole for family getaways.

Staycationing is certainly in vogue, but a holiday let is a high maintenance option for investors, what with regular cleaning and marketing expenses eating into profits.

The truth is that both options have pros and cons.

If you are trying to choose between the two, Telegraph Money explains the key points to consider, including:

You'll need to have money ready to invest with either option - but your outlay can vary considerably due to different locations appealing to renters and staycationers.

Buy-to-let

Renters tend to have different priorities to holidaymakers - properties near transport and amenities will be more sought-after.

In Bournemouth, Ben Jesty, director of Winkworth estate agents, said many renters want to avoid the tourist clogged town centre and head out to suburbs like Westbourne, two miles away, with its great local high street and comparatively easy parking.

Mr Jesty recommends landlords invest in a flat, and suggests budgeting from £220,000 to £350,000 for a two-bedroom property in that area.

Holiday let

Staycationers tend to want to be in the thick of things, and will often pay a premium for a great-looking property with views. A two-bedroom sea view flat in Bournemouth, estimates Mr Jesty, would cost from around £325,000 to £650,000.

There are other costs to bear in mind, too - for example, purchasing either kind of second property will trigger a three per cent stamp duty surcharge.

Mortgages

Unless you're a cash buyer, you'll need a different type of mortgage depending on whether you opt to use a property for buy-to-let or holiday let - and affordability is calculated quite differently.

Buy-to-let

A five-year fixed-rate mortgage (with fees of £1,000 or less) will probably cost you around 4.6pc, said Ray Boulger, senior technical director at mortgage broker John Charcol.

There are cheaper deals out there, but only if you are prepared to pay higher fees. Banks calculate how much they will lend you based on the property's potential rental income.

Your other income could also have an impact on a lender's affordability test. Borrowers are tested according to an ""income cover ratio"" (ICR), which depends on the highest rate of tax you pay.

Basic-rate taxpayers commonly need to prove the rental income being generated by the property is the equivalent to at least 125pc of the mortgage repayments, while higher-rate taxpayers may need to prove 145pc.

Holiday let

You need a specialist mortgage for a holiday let and rates are higher than for a BTL - Mr Boulger said buyers should expect rates of around 5.5pc. Affordability is calculated based on the past few years' accounts for the property (which you will need to extract from the vendor).

If the property has not been previously rented, lenders may be cautious, although if you have surplus income from your job or other sources they will take that into account.

Rental income

To work as an effective investment, both BTL properties and holiday lets need to be able to generate enough rental income to cover your costs and hopefully offer some level of profit.

Buy-to-let

Rents have risen strongly since the peak of the pandemic, which is good news for landlords. According to Rightmove, advertised rents jumped just over 9pc in the year to January.

Amounts vary depending on where you are, but tenants outside London face an average rent of £1,280pcm. In the capital, the average rent is more than £2,100pcm, according to Zoopla.

The big plus point for a BTL over a holiday let, said buying agent James Greenwood of Stacks Property Search, is that they offer a steady income throughout the year. ""But the yield, relative to that of a holiday let, will look low,"" he said.

Holiday let

Holiday lets earn you far more per night than BTLs, but the income is more seasonal and prone to void periods. Rachel and Stuart Smith own one BTL property, a two-bedroom house in Neath, south Wales, which is rented for £600pcm.

The couple, from Somerset, also have two holiday lets, a two-bedroom flat in Brean, Somerset, which rents for between £80 and £90 per night, and a three-bedroom house in Tonypandy, Wales, which fetches circa £70 per night.

From a bottom line perspective, the holiday lets are far more lucrative. But Rachel, 42, who also runs a jewellery business and has three children, aged four, six, and eight, points out that they are also much harder work for her and Stuart, 40, who manages the properties himself.

Earnings are also unpredictable. ""You might only have 30pc occupancy over a month,"" she said. ""On the other hand, I do like having the holiday lets because we do use them ourselves as a family.""

Mr Greenwood seconds these words of caution. Running a holiday let can be challenging.

""There is no guarantee of regular bookings, a bad review can cause considerable damage, and owners of holiday lets are operating in an unpredictable political environment where owners of second homes risk further penalisation,"" he said.

Tax

You'll need to consider the tax you pay on the income you earn from the property, as well as what might be due when you come to sell it.

Buy-to-let

Over the past few years, BTL landlords have lost the key financial benefit of being able to deduct mortgage interest payments from rental income when calculating their tax liability. Landlords do receive a tax credit instead, but it is based on 20pc of their mortgage interest payments - rather than the 40pc, which higher-rate taxpayers used to be able to claim.

Some landlords have set up limited companies to run their rental business, which gets around this problem - although incorporating means other costs, including professional fees and corporation tax when you sell up.

Holiday let

While owners of furnished holiday lets are currently allowed to offset their mortgage interest payments (and the cost of furnishings and refurbishment) from their profits, their tax benefits are set to be slashed from April 2025.

Announced in this year's Budget, from next April furnished holiday let owners will no longer be able to use this tax perk, and they will also no longer be exempted from capital gains tax (CGT) when they sell the property.

These forthcoming rule changes may give some prospective holiday let owners pause before going through with their decision.

Running costs

All properties need some element of repair and maintenance, but your costs - and what you can offset against your tax bill - will be different according to whether or not you choose to be a landlord, or a holiday let owner.

Buy-to-let

Usually, tenants take care of utility bills, TV licence and council tax while they're renting a property - but you might need to foot some bills for periods when it's empty. Landlords are responsible for maintenance and repairs, and the cost of this can be variable.

As a landlord, you'll also need several different safety certificates (gas, electricity, fire) to make sure the property is fit for habitation. Some surveys must be carried out annually, others at the start of a new tenancy. Insurance is a must, and if you buy a leasehold flat there will be ground rent and service charges to pay.

Some landlords take a completely DIY approach, but if you want professional help managing the property and finding new tenants you can enlist the services of a lettings agent or property management company.

If you also want your property managed there is commonly a set-up fee of around £200, followed by a regular charge amounting to 12pc of the monthly rent.

Holiday let

Marketing your property is a major and vital cost to consider. Most holiday let portals take commissions of between 15pc and 25pc per booking. Some also charge a set-up fee of between around £100 and £250.

Airbnb charges hosts a flat 3pc service fee, although it also levies a 14pc fee on guests, which inhibits how much owners can charge for stays.

You must pay all the household bills, and holiday makers tend to be a bit more profligate when someone else is footing the bill. If you have a TV you'll need a special TV licence, costing £159.

You'll also either have to pay council tax - with many councils introducing large surcharges for second-home owners - or business rates, if your property is in England and available for 140 or more days per year. In Wales and Scotland, business rates only kick in if it's actually let for more than 70 days.

Some owners are able to claim small business rate relief to reduce the costs.

Holiday let owners' other expenses will include maintenance, and getting the property cleaned in between guests' stays, and arranging for handovers and emergency cover if a problem erupts mid-stay.

Just as with a BTL, you will also pay ground rent and service charge, depending on your lease, and get insurance. Costs vary depending on location and size of property.

You will also need a valid gas safety certificate, renewed annually, although you are not obligated to get an electrical safety certificate (but it is certainly good practice to get one anyway).

Red tape

The Government has plans for increasing the red tape involved in setting up as a landlord or holiday let owner - but some of the changes may be watered down once they've completed the process of going through Parliament.

Buy-to-let

An increasing number of councils have introduced local licensing schemes, which come at a cost. Fees vary, but as an example, Southwark Council in central London, charges £1,500 for a five-year licence of a property with five or fewer bedrooms.

The Renters Reform Bill, currently going through Parliament, lays out plans for a national landlord register, although its cost - and whether it will operate instead of local schemes or alongside them - is unclear.

Holiday lets

In February, Housing Secretary Michael Gove unveiled plans to rein back the short let industry by requiring landlords to seek planning permission before renting out their properties. The rules would not apply to people renting out their main home for up to 90 days per year, and existing holiday lets are exempted.

Nonetheless, the proposal, which also involves the setting up a national register of holiday lets, could pose a major hurdle to people considering getting into the business if the Conservatives win this year's general election and are able to put the idea into practice.

Separately, if you want a low maintenance new-build flat, you need to check the small print before you buy. Some leases specifically prohibit use for short-term lets.

Exit costs

When it's time to sell up, it's likely you'll owe some tax on any gains the property has made since you bought it - but landlords have more opportunities to reduce it.

Buy-to-let

You may need to pay capital gains tax on any price uplift when you come to sell a rental property. Basic-rate taxpayers pay 18pc, while higher and additional-rate taxpayers currently pay 28pc. From April 6 2024, this will drop to 24pc.

You can deduct the stamp duty you paid when buying the property, the cost of major renovations like an extension, and the selling costs from your CGT bill.

Another way to sidestep CGT is to set up a limited company to buy your investment property. Profits are still taxed, but at lower rates.

Holiday let

Second homes are also liable for CGT when you sell.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

When a loved one is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, it is an overwhelming task for their caregivers to understand the disease and make plans for action. AlzCAP services provided me the needed education and resources, including multiple person-to-person and virtual touchpoints.

In New York, 546,000 family caregivers like me provide care worth over $19 billion annually to their loved ones with dementia. Despite our significant contributions and savings to the state, many caregivers lack adequate support. Funding for AlzCAP has remained stagnant for years. New York State allocates a mere $5 million towards AlzCAP -- an amount that falls woefully short of what is necessary to combat this devastating disease effectively in a state as big and diverse as ours.

Taking care of someone with Alzheimer's is financially and emotionally taxing. AlzCAP provides essential services like 1:1 care planning, support groups, and educational programs, which are vital for those confronting this disease. For many caregivers, these services are the only support they can access.

New York can do better. Please join me in calling on state Sen. Bill Weber and Assemblyman Karl Brabenac and the other members of the NYS Legislature to increase funding for AlzCAP from $5 million to $7 million.

Last year, the K-pop industry was abuzz when YG Entertainment failed to secure contracts for BLACKPINK members' solo activities. After their contracts expired in August, uncertainty loomed over the group's future as there was no news of renewals with YG Entertainment.

The label consistently assured fans that negotiations were ongoing. In a much-anticipated announcement in December 2023, YG Entertainment confirmed BLACKPINK's renewal under the label for group activities.

However, individual members opted to pursue solo endeavors elsewhere. On March 21, the Financial Supervisory Service released YG Entertainment's business report, detailing the company's assets and expenses in 2023.

Drawing from the report, netizens inferred the cost YG Entertainment incurred to renew the contracts of BLACKPINK members for their group activities.

One netizen shared in a popular online community,

""Upon reviewing intangible assets, it appears that a new acquisition cost of 41.185 billion KRW (30.86 million USD) in advance payments was made in 2023.

Considering the significant amount of approximately 41.2 billion KRW (30.9 million USD) in advance payments acquired through new exclusive contracts between YG and YG artists in 2023, it is highly likely that the majority of this sum pertains to BLACKPINK's renewal fees rather than new agreements with BABYMONSTER.""

The netizen continued,

""If you examine the artist list, you can narrow down who signed new exclusive contracts with YG and renewed contracts with YG in 2023.

Given the roster of artists that YG Entertainment managed in 2023, identifying those who either entered into new exclusive contracts or whose contracts were renewed could offer further insights.

From what is known, BLACKPINK and BABYMONSTER were the only artists with contract activities last year.

So it's estimated that BLACKPINK's renewal fees alone would exceed at least 30 billion KRW (22.5 million USD).""

The netizen added,

""The annual amortization cost of KRW 5.5 billion (4.1 million) suggests a prediction that these renewals could span a 7-year contract term.""

The poster estimated that YG Entertainment renewed the group contract with BLACKPINK for approximately 10 billion KRW per member (7.5 million USD).",otakukart.com,news,OtakuKart,Srijita Saha,0.2784313725490195,448880558,1,https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blackpink-811.jpg,eng-9419429

The recent directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) concerning mutual fund schemes with investments in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on foreign exchanges is particularly significant, noted Chirag Mehta, Chief Investment Officer at Quantum AMC, on Saturday. He emphasised that this development arrives at a pivotal juncture for the Mutual Fund industry as it approaches the investment limit of $1 billion prescribed by the regulator for this category, reported the news agency PTI.

Mehta drew parallels to a past scenario when the industry encountered a similar situation upon reaching the $7 billion foreign investment limit. At that time, flows in funds investing in stocks overseas had to be suspended. He speculated that such limits were likely instituted to curtail the outflow of foreign currency within a specific threshold, aiming to mitigate the impact on the balance of payments and, consequently, on the Indian currency.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

Angel One reports that the Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) has been directed by the SEBI to halt new investments in ETFs directing funds to overseas markets. This directive has been issued due to the imminent breach of the upper limit for ETFs established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, which presently stands at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Starting April 1, 2024, there will be a mandatory suspension of new investments for funds of funds (FoFs) engaged in investing in ETFs listed on international markets. This decision aligns with regulatory guidelines established to ensure compliance with the Reserve Bank of India's specified limits concerning foreign investments by mutual funds.

The report calls on multilateral donors and the Ukrainian government to allocate funding to projects that meet ambitious energy efficiency, renewable energy, climate adaptation, and circularity criteria. The criteria is aligned to scenarios representing different levels of damage (minor, moderate and heavy).

The Russian Federation's war of aggression against Ukraine has caused enormous damage on a multitude of levels. A recent assessment from the World Bank shows the massive extent to which the Ukrainian building stock has been affected by the war. For the housing sector alone, the total cost of the damage exceeds an estimated USD 55.9 billion, while more than USD 80.3 billion is needed for reconstruction.

Following the ""build back better"" principle, BPIE stresses that reconstruction that should strengthen the entire Ukrainian energy system. Reconstructing the Ukrainian building stock in alignment with existing EU buildings legislation will also support the country's accession process to the EU, create an environment where people can thrive and attract people to return to their homes.

'Discussing reconstruction of Ukraine amidst ongoing destruction is a signal of unwavering support and hope for peace,' said Oliver Rapf, Executive Director at BPIE.

'Multilateral donors and the government of Ukraine have a responsibility to ensure money flows towards building back better than before. It isn't just about investment criteria to tick boxes, but about investing in the future of a free Ukraine.'

The 'build back better' principle, when applied to buildings, is aimed at accelerating the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the building stock after major disaster. Multiple EU member states, such as Croatia, Italy or Germany, after facing natural disasters, have based their recovery and reconstruction programmes on this principle, and designed strategies that include energy efficiency goals.

'Green reconstruction is critical in view of Ukraine's future integration into the EU,' said Olena Pavlenko, President of Ukraine based think tank, DiXi Group.

'It is also a significant component to enhance the Ukraine's energy security, a matter of great relevance amidst the energy challenges posed by the war. Such recommendations will enable the incorporation of two essential elements - sustainability and security - into reconstruction projects.'

Multilateral donors are encouraged to allocate funds to projects that address the entire energy performance of buildings, taking the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) standard as a benchmark.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a 100 million dollar (£79.2 million) increase for research into Alzheimer's.",dailyecho.co.uk,news,Southern Daily Echo,,0.2941176470588236,448880022,1,https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/resources/images/17893276/,

Transak is a fiat-to-crypto payment gateway that streamlines the process of buying and selling cryptocurrency, allowing both mainstream users and businesses to access crypto and blockchain. It allows users to use their fiat currency to buy cryptocurrencies and vice-versa, acting as both an on-ramp for applications.

The company is looking to expand its operations, partnerships, and work base in India, and is going to use the amount raised to hire more engineers and expand its team in the country. Transak has existing operations in more than 60 countries, and plans to expand and consolidate this coverage by the end of 2021.

Transak acts both as a B2C platform where one can buy cryptocurrencies directly into their wallet using fiat money, and a B2B platform in the form of a developer integration that can be used by third-party applications and websites. Transak allows for applications to enable the use of cryptocurrency for transactions via its application. On Transak, one will be able to buy crypto using bank transfers, debit/credit cards, wallets, and various payment applications worldwide.

Transak is integrated with fiat payment methods around the globe that can be used to make the purchase. Currently, the company is working closely with other players in the Indian blockchain ecosystem, including WazirX and Matic Network. Globally, Transak is integrated by top wallets and apps such as Metamask, Klever Wallet, and Edge Wallet, and top DeFi apps such as Maskbook, Aave, and Index Coop.

London-based Transak said in a statement that India's cryptocurrency trading community has grown many times over, but still represents a small portion of the world's youngest economy. Decentralised finance has caught the attention of many potential traders and investors due to the high returns and constant growth of the market. The Indian talent in the crypto ecosystem has shown exceptional performance, and has driven remarkable results for various players in the industry. Thus, the company aims to acquire the best Indian talent to build a strong team for operations in the country.

Whilst traditional crypto exchanges allow users to trade and speculate on cryptocurrencies, Transak's mission is to allow users to access cryptocurrency from fiat in order to actually use blockchain applications, decentralised finance (DeFi), payments, and many more applications. Whilst these applications are still in their infancy, they are expected to be used throughout India and the world to power the lives of individuals and businesses within the next five years.

Sami Start and Yeshu Agarwal, Co-founders, Transak said:

""We are extremely confident about our expansion plans in India. The Indian blockchain market is growing rapidly and needs on and off-ramps to make the crypto world accessible to all. The company is excited to acquire fresh Indian talent, which is known to be exceptional across the globe and are dedicated to building a strong team in the country to take over the Indian operations. We are highly motivated to ease the friction in the global crypto market and take decentralised finance mainstream.""

THE speed at which huge investments are being implemented at the Dinson Iron and Steel Plant in Manhize, accompanied by facilities for value addition and beneficiation, attest to the favourable investment climate created by the Second Republic, President Mnangagwa has said.

Addressing thousands of workers after touring the plant, he said: ""This investment and the speed at which works are ongoing is a testimony of the confidence the investors of this project have in the conducive business environment and policies of the Second Republic.

""Over the years, the full potential of our iron ore resources and value chains have remained largely untapped. However, under the Second Republic, the milestones we are realising through exceptional teamwork, focus and determination from both public and private sector have seen the establishment of this national strategic project.

""It is therefore pleasing that our iron ore will be fully exploited, value added and beneficiated locally. This shift in focus allows us to realise maximum benefits from our natural resources, while also capitalising on the value chains including processing, manufacturing and the supply of high-value finished steel goods and products.""

The President said by producing its own steel, Zimbabwe was priming itself for unprecedented infrastructure development, pursuant to the attainment of Vision 2030.

""The revitalisation of iron and steel industry in turn has immense potential to anchor the ongoing modernisation, industrialisation and growth of our economy. However, as we embark on this journey, we must continue to prioritise sustainability and responsible resource management.

""Modern technologies must be adopted towards minimising adverse environmental impacts. The well-being of our communities should not be overlooked. Mineral resources are finite hence their extraction should leave a positive legacy for future generations,"" he said.

The President said the steel plant would stimulate growth in Zimbabwe's economy, which would have the ultimate effect of improving people's livelihoods.

""As you may be aware, Zimbabwe is home to vast deposits of minerals, including iron ore, which is a critical raw material with multiple applications across industries.

""Inputs for sectors such as the automotive industry, consumer durables, railways, aviation as well as construction and infrastructure development are derived from the iron and steel industry. Hence, this sector generates output and employment opportunities for numerous other industries,"" he said.

""Value addition and beneficiation is the backbone of the National Development Strategy industrial transformation pillar for the attainment of Vision 2030,"" he said.

In its first phase, the steel plant will produce 600 000 tonnes, 100 000 tonnes more than present local demand, and the production levels will gradually rise until peak levels of 5 million tonnes a year after the final planned phase when Zimbawbe becomes a major exporter.

President Mnangagwa said this would stimulate local industries.

""The steel plant will catalyse downstream industries, creating a positive ripple effect of economic growth and job creation. By producing steel locally, we can reduce our reliance on imports, stimulate local industries and foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, investing in iron ore processing and steel production aligns with our broader vision for sustainable development,"" said President Mnangagwa.

He implored the Dinson Iron and Steel Company to expedite its operations so that maximum production levels are reached ahead of schedule.

""This project is indeed a strategic investment that will unlock broad economic potential and stimulate growth across all sectors of the economy. All efforts must therefore continue to be done so that the plant is completed and quickly brought to full production,"" he said.

""It is my hope that all efforts will be made to ensure that outstanding works are completed as per the schedule for the production of both pig iron and steel billets and bars.""

President Mnangagwa commended Chinese companies for continuing with their investments in the country, in the true spirit of friendship.

""I applaud companies from the People's Republic of China for the continued investments in our economy. This investment through Dinson Iron and Steel Company signifies more than just financial support; it represents a shared vision for a brighter future between Zimbabwe and China,"" he said.

He applauded the workers for the hard work they had put in, saying the development of the project was truly a testimony that ""nyika inovakwa nevene vayo"".

""To the men, youth and women who are working tirelessly to realise the completion of this project, I commend you for your dedication. Your hard work, commitment and contributions through our various skills is demonstrative of the possibilities that we can achieve as a united and peaceful people.

""Further guided by our national development philosophy that Nyika inovakwa, inotongwa inonamatigwa nevene vayo/llizwe lakhiwa, libuswe, likhulekelwe ngabanikazi balo', as well as our foreign policy mantra, 'Zimbabwe is a friend to all and an enemy of none', we will undoubtedly realise the targets we set out towards a prosperous economy and higher standard of life for our people,"" he said.

Mines and Mining Development Minister Soda Zhemu said Zimbabwe was headed in the right direction because of its focus on value addition and beneficiation as enunciated by President Mnangagwa.

""It is the cornerstone of a larger vision, the creation of a mining town which will serve as a hub for innovation and economic growth focusing on economic beneficiation and value addition,"" he said.

Midlands Province's Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Cde Owen Ncube said the province was grateful for the development happening under the Second Republic.

""This recognition has induced more energy, passion and desire to do even better without compromise towards the attainment of an upper-middle-income society earlier than 2030,"" he said.

DISCO's managing director Mr Benson Xu said the company was committed to aiding Zimbabwe's development agenda.

""I saw mountains of iron ore and saw an opportunity for us to achieve the steel project in Zimbabwe and for Zimbabwe,"" he said.

The vast project which has already employed 1500 Zimbabweans, is set to push out its first products in June this year.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a 100 million dollar (£79.2 million) increase for research into Alzheimer's.",irvinetimes.com,news,Irvine Times,,0.2941176470588236,448879865,1,https://www.irvinetimes.com/resources/images/17893276/,

WASHINGTON, DC - Today, U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) announced that she secured key priorities and funding wins for Nevada in the second of two bipartisan government funding packages, which passed the Senate and is now headed to the President's desk. She secured funding to support the needs of the Nevada Air National Guard, enhance workforce training in Nevada, help small business startups, and assist first responders. The bill that Senator Rosen helped pass also makes major investments to secure the U.S. southern border, help Israel defend itself against Hamas, enhance U.S. national security, and combat the fentanyl crisis. It includes a historic 5.2 percent raise for our servicemembers, the largest troop pay raise in decades.

The Senate's bipartisan government funding package also includes Senator Rosen's requests for increased funding for the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, funding to support pediatric mental health care, and investments in cybersecurity workforce development.

""In passing this bipartisan government funding legislation, we are helping to secure our border, combat the fentanyl crisis, invest in our national security, and give servicemembers a much-deserved raise,"" said Senator Rosen. ""I'm particularly proud to have secured wins for Nevada that will bring the Nevada Air National Guard one step closer to securing new aircraft to combat wildfires, help expand workforce training opportunities throughout the state, and support our law enforcement officers and first responders. I'll continue working every day to deliver for my state and put Nevada first.""

Among these investments is more than $40 million in Community Project Funding for 24 Nevada programs and construction projects. In all, including the first FY24 funding package signed into law, Rosen secured over $17 million for 100 Nevada projects. The projects in the second funding bill include key priorities for Nevada, including:

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",thejakartapost.com,news,The Jakarta Post,,0.0980392156862746,448879717,1,https://img.jakpost.net/c/2024/03/23/2024_03_23_148646_1711182973._large.jpg,

This is reminiscent of the time when the industry had reached the $7 billion foreign investment limit and had to suspend flows in funds investing in stocks overseas.

These limits probably were put in place to limit outflows of foreign currency within a limit to reduce the impact on balance of payments and thereby on the Indian currency, Mehta said.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

The Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) received a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instructing a cessation of new investments in ETFs allocating funds to overseas markets, as per Angel One.

This action comes in response to the nearing breach of the upper limit for ETFs set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, currently standing at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Effective from April 1, 2024, fund of funds (FoFs) investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on international markets will be required to halt the acceptance of new investments.

More than 600 attendees, including diplomatic envoys, representatives of domestic and overseas governmental agencies and international economic organizations, as well as executives of Fortune Global 500 enterprises and well-known multinational companies, were involved in discussions on deepening investment in the Chinese market, promoting green and open development, and enhancing supply chain efficiency.

Hubei is a vital growth pole for the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. It has great market vitality and serves as the financial and technological center of central China. Over the years, the province has been working closely with European countries to facilitate the expansion and improvement of bilateral trade and investment.

According to the provincial department of commerce, Hubei's total foreign trade volume with Europe was 124.12 billion yuan (about 17.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023, up 28.3 percent year on year.

There are about 700 European companies that have invested in Hubei, including 74 Fortune Global 500 firms. Ezhou Huahu Airport, located in the city of Ezhou in Hubei, has successfully opened international freight routes to countries such as Belgium and Germany, and China-Europe freight trains now serve 109 cities in 40 countries across Eurasia, with over 1,000 train trips operated last year.

""We've been deeply involved over 40 years in the Chinese market, and we are one of China's largest foreign investors in electricity generation with nuclear power,"" said Fabrice Fourcade, chairman and CEO of EDF (China) Holding Ltd., at a celebration of the 10th anniversary of an agreement to build the Sino-French Wuhan Ecological Demonstration City.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and China, EDF is happy and ready to continue deepening cooperation with Hubei for a successful energy transition, Fourcade said.

The event also showcased promising Germany-China cooperation prospects in fields such as green development and rail transportation. Since the Wuhan Sino-German International Industrial Park was constructed more than four years ago, it has attracted 58 foreign-funded enterprises.

Germany-based Knorr-Bremse Group established ties with Hubei over 10 years ago, exploring cooperation in the commercial vehicle sector, and it has since participated extensively in the construction of multiple rail transit projects in Wuhan.

By the end of 2023, Knorr-Bremse had contributed to the design of nearly 380 kilometers of rail in Hubei, designing 12 subway and tram lines, and providing safe and reliable daily travel services for millions of Hubei residents, said Eric Bi, president and member of the Knorr-Bremse RVS China Board.

Knorr-Bremse will continue increasing its investment in R&D and local capacity-building for key technologies such as braking systems, and it will build an innovative system based on the local supply chain, Bi said.

Hubei is now consolidating its green and high-quality development momentum. Since 2016, the province has implemented more than 28,000 major technological transformation projects, with energy consumption per unit of GDP decreasing by 20.2 percent, construction land use by 23 percent, and carbon emissions by 23.9 percent.

China and Europe are each other's major partners in investment and trade, said Ning Jizhe, executive vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. A long-term, favorable future for China-Europe relations relies on the new achievements of complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, he noted. ■",english.news.cn,news,english.news.cn,,0.3803921568627451,448879654,1,,

The approved legislation banned UNRWA funding ""for any amounts provided in prior fiscal years or in fiscal year 2024, or for amounts provided in fiscal year 2025, until March 25, 2025.""

The clause was separated from the rest of the appropriations package and is stipulated as a calendar-year ban, which leaves open the potential for allocating any leftover funds to UNRWA after March 2025. Had it been a fiscal-year ban, there would not be any opportunity to fund UNRWA before October 2025. Moreover, it would have set a precedent much harder for Congress to overcome in subsequent spending packages.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz praised the measure in a post on X, writing: ""The historic ban on US funding to UNRWA that passed today with overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and can not be part of the solution.""

""UNRWA will not be a part of Gaza's landscape in the aftermath of Hamas. Thousands of UNRWA employees are involved in Hamas terror activities and their facilities were used for terrorist purposes.""

He added a call for other countries to also ban funding the UN agency for Palestinians over the allegations.

""The UNRWA ban punted the decision to whoever is in power in March 2025 to either fund or not fund the agency,"" said Joel Braunold, managing director of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace.

""The legislative ban is an irregular one because it extends beyond the annual appropriations cycle into only half of the next year. Practically, this means that an administration could decide to fund UNRWA if Congress can't agree on a budget next year,"" he added.

In Congress, though, resuming UNRWA funding in subsequent spending bills will likely be much more difficult, given that a growing number of moderate Democrats have joined Republicans in souring on the agency since the latest allegations against its staffers came out.

Instead of funding UNRWA, the appropriations bills passed Saturday earmarked $175 million in funds for other humanitarian projects in the West Bank and Gaza, which will go through the US Agency for International Development.

The figure is a $50 million slash from last year, as part of a package that saw cuts across the board.

Some Democrats sought to block the UNRWA ban, arguing that it is currently the primary agency providing aid to Palestinians in war-torn Gaza, but were vastly outnumbered in the vote.

""This will undermine the effort to assist starving Gazans and potentially further weaken regional stability,"" UNRWA said in a statement earlier this week.

The US froze its funding immediately after the Israeli allegations emerged against UNRWA staffers, all of whom were quickly fired by the agency.

The US has historically been the leading donor to UNRWA, giving between $300 and $400 million a year -- save for a three-year period during the Trump administration when all funding was cut.

From the start of the latest fiscal year in October until the January freeze, the Biden administration gave $121 million to UNRWA.

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in January that roughly $300,000 earmarked for UNRWA had been withheld as a result of the freeze, adding that Washington was looking to divert the funds to other agencies such as the World Food Program and UNICEF, the relief agency for children.

Neither is believed to be equipped to distribute aid at the scale UNRWA can, given the massive discrepancies in local Gaza staff.

UNRWA was established in 1949 by a UN General Assembly resolution after Israel's War of Independence, when 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes.

Today, it directly employs 30,000 Palestinians, serving the civic and humanitarian needs of 5.9 million descendants of those refugees, in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and in vast camps in neighboring Arab countries.

In Gaza, UNRWA runs the enclave's schools, primary healthcare clinics and other social services, and distributes humanitarian aid.

US support is believed to account for one-third of UNRWA's budget, raising questions as to whether the agency will be able to overcome the cut in the long term.

The US was the first of 14 countries that announced the January freeze on funding to UNRWA, which employs roughly 13,000 people in Gaza and is the main supplier of food, water and shelter there.

A handful of those countries, including Canada, Finland and Australia, have since announced resumptions to their funding amid growing fears of imminent famine in Gaza.

The US said it would wait until a UN independent review panel concluded its probe into UNRWA before resuming its already-allocated donations.

On Tuesday, that panel issued an interim report determining that UNRWA has mechanisms in place to ensure its neutrality, but also has deficiencies that must be addressed.

The review board will develop its final report with recommendations for how UNRWA should address neutrality concerns going forward and present it to the public on April 20.

Israel has long pushed for UNRWA's closure, arguing that it helps perpetuate the conflict with the Palestinians since it confers refugee status upon descendants of those originally displaced around the time of Israel's War of Independence, unlike other refugee groups around the world.

The agency has also been found to employ antisemitic staffers and use textbooks Israel deemed antisemitic and inciting.

UNRWA fired 12 of its employees in January after it received evidence from Israel that they participated in Hamas's October 7 terror onslaught. But Israel has since offered intelligence to stakeholders showing that some 1,200 of UNRWA's 13,000 staffers have ties to Gaza terrorists.

A senior European diplomat said on condition of anonymity that Jerusalem is ""cynically"" making such allegations in order to force UNRWA's dissolution, after never taking issue with the employee lists it received from the agency in previous years.

An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed this account, telling The Times of Israel that the lists it received from UNRWA were partial, did not contain ID numbers necessary for vetting the employees and were sometimes sent a full year after staffers began working for the agency.

Nonetheless, Israel identified Hamas activists on UNRWA's payroll on several occasions. In 2012, Israel alerted UNRWA that one of its principals, Sohail al-Hindi, was a Hamas activist, but it took until after Hindi's election to Hamas's politburo in 2017 for UNRWA to fire him, according to the Foreign Ministry spokesman.",timesofisrael.com,news,The Times of Israel,,-0.207843137254902,448879523,1,https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/03/AFP__20240217__34JH2X9__v1__HighRes__PalestinianIsraelConflictUn.jpg,eng-9412421

Senate passes $1.2 trillion funding package in early morning vote, ending threat of partial shutdown

WASHINGTON: The Senate passed a $1.2 trillion package of spending bills in the early morning hours Saturday, a long overdue action nearly six months into the budget year that will push any threats of a government shutdown to the fall. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Tussle over amendments

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

Republican anger

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterwards that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In a sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Unpopular package

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

What Democrats say

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new childcare centres for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

In the recently completed session, the Legislature directed $335.8 million in 2024 supplemental budget spending and $306 million more for school construction.

The Port Angeles School District will accept the funding that comes its way, but it will hardly move the needle on the district's straitened financial circumstances or influence bargaining with paraeducators, who are seeking a 3.7 percent wage increase and have voted to authorize a strike April 8 if their demands are not met.

The best news for Port Angeles might be the increase in state support for the School Construction Assistance Program from $271.61 to $375 per square foot for new construction projects.

The district plans to put a capital bond on the November general election ballot to fund construction of new Port Angeles High and Franklin Elementary schools.

""When you're talking about a high school, which is about 210,000 square feet, that quickly adds up,"" Superintendent Marty Brewer said.

Lawmakers did not advance legislation that would have changed the supermajority requirement needed to pass school bonds, but increasing state funding could be an incentive for voters to approve them, he said.

Included in the Legislature's funding was an increase for school districts of about $21 per student more for materials, supplies and operating costs (MSOC) retroactive to the start of the 2023-2024 school year and for 2024-2025, said Business and Operations Director Kira Acker. That is money the district will not have to divert from other funding buckets, she said.

Lawmakers also increased the amount of safety net funding districts can apply for to provide high-need students with services that exceed state and federal funding provisions, but they did not address the problem of underfunding special education as a whole, Brewer said.

The Legislature narrowed the funding gap between what the state pays for special education and the actual number of students in a district who receive those services, but it fell short of fully funding special education, which districts around the state -- including Port Angeles -- have been seeking.

The state caps its support of special education as a percentage of total student enrollment. Starting in 2024-2025, the cap will rise from 15 percent to 16 percent; the Legislature upped the cap from 13.5 percent to 15 percent during its 2023 regular session.

Two consecutive years of increased special education funding is welcome, Brewer said, but it's insufficient when 20 percent of district students receive special education services.

""It's progress, but it's the long overdue progress,"" Brewer said. ""It's one of the most vulnerable populations that we have that we don't receive full funding for. It frustrates me in the name of equity -- that we're supposed to be working at the district level and the state level to really give resources to balance that playing field for all of our kids.""

The number of students who qualify for special education continues to grow, even though the district closed open enrollment a couple of years ago.

Districts are required by state and federal law to provide special education services to students with disabilities. Education assistance can include one-on-one support in classes; interpretive services, such as American Sign Language; speech, occupational and physical therapy; and psychological and counseling services. The district contracts with many of these providers, which is costly.

""Those funds have to come from somewhere because we can't turn that child away, nor would we,"" Brewer said. ""We provide the services and the staffing for those students and that's an important statement.""

Much of the responsibility for working with students with the most severe disabilities falls on paraeducators, who provide everything from one-on-one instruction to hygiene care.

Paraeducators have been bargaining with the district since last summer and working without a contract since Sept. 1. Paraeducators want the same wage increase of 3.7 percent for school employees set by the Legislature that members of the Port Angeles Education Association and the district agreed to in their negotiations.

The state does not dedicate funds to cover wage increases for every district school employee. The increases -- which are intended to offset inflation -- are not guaranteed and must be negotiated between the district and the individual bargaining units.

The state funds the equivalent of 10 full-time paraeducators in Port Angeles; there are 130 working in the district, most of whom are part time.

Brewer said the district does not have the capacity to meet the PAPEA demand for a wage increase, as well as other requests for an annual step increase on its salary schedule; compensation for training, certification and degrees; compensation for hard-to-fill positions; and longevity that would kick in earlier and with a higher rate of pay.

Legislation that passed this session, which amended the prototypical school staffing model and provided $72 million more for hiring paraeducators, administrative support and other non-teaching employees, hardly made a dent in a staffing shortage that is statewide, Brewer said.

""It ended up increasing the para allocation for our district by about half a para, and it increased our secretary allocation by about a half a position as well,"" he said.

The PAPEA has argued that it is within the district's 2023 budget to afford the $128,210 it would cost to provide its 130 members with just the 3.7 percent wage increase.

Paraeducators earn hourly wages ranging from $21.68 to $28.33. Like teachers, they work 10 months out of the year, but their salaries are paid out over the course of 12 months. The low pay, the PAPEA has said, has forced many of its members to take on second jobs and has made hiring and retention difficult.

Loss of enrollment -- the primary fuel of public school revenue -- has hit Port Angeles hard. School board President Sarah Methner said during the budgeting process last spring that members made what they believed to be a very conservative estimate of the number of full-time students enrolled for the 2023-2024 school year.

It approved a budget based on 3,365 FTE students, but only 3,324 ended up enrolling. Those 41 fewer students represent $600,343 in revenue the district will not receive.

The district is the process of developing its 2024-2025 budget, but until it has an agreement with paraeducators, as well as Teamsters and coaches who are also without contracts, it is stymied in completing that task.

The next bargaining session between the district and the PAPEA is scheduled for Wednesday. Three additional meetings have been scheduled during spring break, April 1-5, to try to hammer out an agreement and avoid the strike PAPEA members overwhelmingly voted to approve. All negotiations are being mediated by a representative with the Washingston State Public Employment Relations Commission.

The district is planning to send out a letter to parents next week notifying them of next steps should the PAPEA strike and members of the teachers union vote to join them.

""We will continue to stay focused on the issues and the work,"" Brewer said. ""We're going to work really hard to try to get a deal done, but it has to be done in a sustainable financial manner.""

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

- Shutdown preparations 'ceased' -

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

According to data, from a leading blockchain analytics firm, UAE investors reaped capital gains amounting to $204 million from their cryptocurrency ventures in 2023.

In the broader Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, It stands out as a frontrunner in crypto investment gains, securing the second position after Saudi Arabia. The latter boasted a remarkable $351 million in gains, underscoring the growing traction of digital assets in the Middle East. Notably, no other GCC countries made it to Chainalysis's top 50 list, highlighting dominance in the regional crypto sphere.

Amidst global market fluctuations, 2023 witnessed a significant rebound in the crypto sector, following the tumultuous events of the previous year. Chainalysis reported a total of $37.6 billion in gains for global crypto investors, signifying a robust recovery from the losses incurred in 2022. While this figure falls short of the highs seen during the 2021 bull market, it nonetheless demonstrates renewed investor confidence and market stability.

Bitcoin's dominance among investors reveals a significant shift towards established digital assets, marking a pivotal moment in the country's crypto landscape. With an impressive 70% share of total gains in 2023, Bitcoin's appeal underscores a level of maturity and confidence among investors.

This preference for proven performers like Bitcoin and Ethereum mirrors global trends, emphasizing the growing importance of institutional investments in shaping the crypto market.

Kim Grauer, Director of Research at Chainalysis, highlights the nuanced investor sentiment driving this preference, further solidifying the country's position as a key player in the evolving world of digital currencies.

Grauer's insights into the maturity displayed by its investors shed light on their cautious approach, opting for assets with a track record of stability and performance.

Moreover, the relatively smaller fraction attributed to Ripple's XRP underscores a strategic investment approach prevalent among UAE investors. By focusing on assets with proven track records, UAE investors are aligning themselves with a broader trend towards stability and maturity in the crypto market.

Bitcoin's dominance in the UAE signals a growing sophistication among investors and underscores the country's emergence as a significant player in the global crypto scene.

The strong performance of digital assets in countries like India, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which collectively realized gains of $2.07 billion, holds promising implications for the UAE's crypto ecosystem.

Given the substantial population demographic represented by these nations, there exists significant potential for crypto-facilitated cross-border transactions. This trend aligns with the UAE government's forward-looking stance on pioneering innovative financial solutions and fostering international partnerships.

As the UAE emerges as a key player in the global crypto investment scene, the country's preference for established digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum underscores a maturing market. With institutional investments driving transaction volumes and a positive outlook for cross-border crypto transactions, the UAE's crypto community is poised for further growth and innovation in the coming years.

The UAE's ascent in the crypto arena reflects a broader trend of increasing adoption and acceptance of digital assets worldwide, signaling a promising future for the intersection of finance and technology in the region.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.4980392156862745,448878891,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

The 1,012-page legislation funds the agencies for Homeland Security, Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Labor, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Education; Legislative Branch; and State and Foreign Operations through Sept. 30. HFC members slammed the legislation in a Friday morning press conference ahead of the vote, largely over the increased funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its secretary office, which is held by Alejandro Mayorkas.

""Is there anything that some Republicans won't do to keep this government open? Why are we in a rush to keep this government open that is so harming the American people by the very policies which they are suffering under?,"" said HFC Chairman Bob Good. ""And the bill that's being voted on today will be Republicans joining with Democrats to fund this DHS. Instead we must say enough, not on our watch.""

The second funding package released on Thursday provides $19 million in additional funds to the Office of the DHS Secretary. The GOP-held House voted to impeach Mayorkas on Feb. 13 over his handling of the border crisis.

""Every single Republican should vote no, should vote no. And should be ashamed of ever voting yes,"" said former HFC Chairman Scott Perry. ""And if they don't vote no on this bill, what they're saying to their constituents -- their bosses who sent them to Washington, D.C. -- Democrat or Republican, what you saw at the border, that's fine with me. That's good. Let's get more of that.""

""Anybody who votes for this bill today owns every stinking bit of it,"" said Texas Rep. Chip Roy. ""They own the destruction of the American economy with all these regulations killing families. They own the wide open borders, causing death and destruction. They own the fentanyl pouring into communities. If you fund it, you own it.""

The House is set to vote for the legislation on Friday, just before government funding runs out at 11:59 p.m.

Lawmakers previously passed its first ""minibus"" on March 6 to partially complete the appropriations process, which President Joe Biden signed on March 9. The legislation funded Commerce, Justice and Science; Energy and Water Development; Department of the Interior and Environment; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; Agriculture; and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

Congress approved the bill with a Senate vote after midnight, avoiding a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise President Joe Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

Mr Biden is expected to sign the bill into law (AP)

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The process has led to frustration, especially among Republicans (AP)

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

Masood Khan, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, said both sides are working hard to recalibrate bilateral ties, affirming that its impact will lead to a ""bright future"".

Ambassador Masood, while speaking at the March 23rd reception held at the Pakistan embassy in Washington to commemorate the 1940 Lahore Resolution, said that the US and Islamabad are striving to recalibrate bilateral ties based on trade, investment, green energy healthcare, education and science and technology.

Paying tribute to Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah for his unparalleled resolve and leadership, the envoy underscored the significance of the Pakistan Resolution terming it as a milestone which later materialised into the creation of an independent state.

Expressing gratitude to the US State Department for its efforts to strengthen bilateral relations, Khan reiterated Islamabad's resolve to a ""peaceful neighbourhood"".

He also lamented the human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) stressing that the Kashmiris should be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination in line with the United Nations (UN) resolutions.

Furthermore, the ambassador conferred the country's national awards on two Pakistani Americans Nasruddin Rupani and Hafeez Khan.

Speaking on the occasion, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Asia Michael Schiffer reaffirmed Washington's support for Islamabad's long-term development goals.

On the prospective areas of cooperation between the two countries, Schiffer underscored the significance of the hydropower sector, access to technology and quality education, and mitigation of trade barriers.

Accentuating the approval of the global climate fund to boost Pakistan's efforts to tackle climate change and water scarcity, the official stressed that the Green Alliance Framework -- a joint initiative between the two countries -- is assisting Pakistan to address future challenges pertaining to climate, energy and economy.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

The strong demand is evident from indicators like burgeoning air passenger traffic and sale of passenger vehicles, rising digital payments, improved consumer confidence and expectations of a normal monsoon, the report states.

Increased demand for residential properties in tier-2 and tier-3 cities augers well for furthering construction activity. Non-farm employment has revived, improving the capacity to absorb the labour leaving agriculture. The ascent of manufacturing sector employment is expected to be marked by upscaling of enterprises and sunrise sectors emerging as catalysts for generating quality employment, the report points out.

India's inflation outlook for the upcoming months is positive. Core inflation is trending downwards, indicating a broad-based moderation in price pressures. The pick-up in summer sowing is likely to help reduce food prices, the report states.

On the external front, the narrowing merchandise trade deficit and the rising net services receipts are expected to result in an improvement in the current account balance in FY24.

In FY25, however, the current account deficit will bear watching. An increase in domestic household savings will be necessary to finance private sector capital formation in the economy, the report states.

Improving global investor confidence on India has started reflecting in foreign portfolio investment flows. The announcement by Bloomberg that India would be included in its bond index from January 2025 should bolster inflows, buoyed by the fiscal prudence that the government has demonstrated over the years. Bond investors will base their investment decisions based on their perception of its persistence.

Groups in the county can apply for up to £8,300 from the Prime Foundation's annual fund.

The foundation was established to improve education, health, and social wellbeing at community levels.

Causes where Prime, a health and care property developer, has erected new facilities form the core targets for the funding.

The grants also serve to support initiatives close to the foundation's birthplace, Worcestershire.

In the previous year, three community initiatives, including STEPWAY, a charity dedicated to veterans and their families, have received funding.

Using the funds it was able to build a large shed on a pontoon with the aid of the acquired funding - offering safekeeping for machinery, as well as quieter office spaces.

Stepway's CEO, Dawn Turner, said: ""The funding received from the Prime Foundation has transformed and enhanced support services at the Stepway community garden.

""The office and workshop will benefit veterans, family members and the local community.""

Unfortunately, vandalism befell the shed last year, which consequently led to multiple acts of aid, including the foundation's financial aid for the installation of monitoring equipment to enhance site security.

The Worcester Child Contact Centre, another beneficiary of the fund, had its facilities upgraded.

The funding saw the development of a parent-child reading zone full of books, toys, furniture, games, and crafts.

Lastly, the Lido Park Tennis Club had an influx of equipment which sparked the start of a club for homeschooled children and teens in Droitwich Spa.

Hannah Cashmore, a trustee of the foundation, said: ""We've witnessed the profound impact of our funding on local groups year-on-year, and we're eager to open applications for community-led projects once again.

""We look forward to reviewing submissions and continuing to invest in the wellbeing of our local Worcestershire community.""

The deadline for online applications via the foundation's website is May 22.",redditchadvertiser.co.uk,news,Redditch Advertiser,Nathan Russell,0.3490196078431373,448878081,1,https://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/17892659/,

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

A new scheme hopes to introduce to the world a new wave of filmmakers from the city

Many recent Hong Kong films have been aimed at the Chinese market. The idea is that it’s time to show the rest of the world what Hong Kong cinema is capable of

In 1982, having just accepted his Oscar for best screenplay for the film Chariots of Fire, in Los Angeles, Colin Welland famously and impertinently declared, “The British are coming!” (The phrase supposedly originated with American revolutionary hero Paul Revere, almost certainly a myth.)

Dr Wilfred Wong Ying-wai isn’t about to make such a bold claim on behalf of Hong Kong’s filmmakers – although, arguably, he would be entitled to.

As chairman of the Hong Kong Film Development Council (FDC), Wong is at the vanguard of a drive to introduce Hong Kong cinema to the world through the Hong Kong-Europe-Asian Film Collaboration Funding Scheme.

The scheme is an extension of another, the Hong Kong-Asian Film Collaboration Funding Scheme, launched in November 2022 to facilitate co-productions by Hong Kong filmmakers and counterparts elsewhere in Asia.

The Hong Kong-Asian scheme attracted 28 applications; the four productions selected for FDC support, which will each receive US$1.1 million, will be announced this month. (The call for proposals for the Hong Kong-Europe-Asian scheme will begin soon; details can be found at fdc.gov.hk.)

“This is a way of introducing the new generation of moviemakers,” says Wong during a video call from Macau. “We would like our people to see the world. Hong Kong movies are not made just for Hong Kong or China, they should be made with a broader perspective.”15 highlights from the Hong Kong International Film Festival 2024

Both schemes require the participation of at least one Hong Kong director, producer or screenwriter in a production in collaboration with others from Europe or Asia.

The director, producer or screenwriter must also have been nominated for an award at a Hong Kong or an international film festival, or to have won one.

Although the strategy may be admirable, isn’t this a case of reintroducing Hong Kong cinema to the world? Time was when Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest were shorthand for the same; and Bruce Lee’s latest film was a guaranteed global smash hit.

“If you look at the different stages of Hong Kong cinema, there was Bruce Lee, then a lot of police stories and in the last 15 years or so there has been a shift in our focus, on China,” says Wong. “There is a lot of co-production with China and a focus on what can sell there.

“We feel that for Hong Kong to continue to develop and introduce our movies to the world, we would like our directors to have a wider vision.

“Hong Kong has this function of being the centre for cultural exchange between East and West, so we hope that with this widening of the scheme, to include Europe, we will pave the way for some of our movie people to go international.”

To that end, Hong Kong has already had boots on the ground, as it were. In February, a delegation from government office Create HK, which works closely with the FDC, accompanied three producers and two directors to the Berlin International Film Festival.

Also in attendance were directors Ann Hui On-wah and Ray Yeung. The collaborative scheme was introduced and, Create HK reported, the interest of numerous European directors and producers piqued.

How will potential filmmaking partners be chosen? And by whom?

“We leave the [selection] initiative to the applicants,” says Wong. “Hong Kong companies wanting to collaborate can identify their own partners. There’s a matching process: if producers, directors or scriptwriters from foreign companies are interested they can match themselves with Hong Kong companies to apply for the scheme.

“Leaving everything to the applicants is the most effective way.”

Public appreciation of the films made with the support of the scheme, which can be shot anywhere in the world, could eventually be coming to a cinema near you, and then a streaming platform.

“We would like the movies to aim for theatrical release, with a minimum number of screenings,” adds Wong. “We hope that will lead to international audiences.”

The government, which over the years has spent billions of dollars to support the Hong Kong film industry, will see no direct return on the money it puts up under the scheme. Any profits will accrue to the successful applicants, Wong says, with their films to be released within about three years.

As for Wong, while his day job as executive vice-chairman of Sands China comes with the not inconsiderable responsibility of running the organisation’s hotels and casinos in Macau, his work – all pro bono – on behalf of Hong Kong filmmakers seems endless.

His chairmanship of the FDC aside, he founded the Asian Film Awards in 2007 and has been chairman of the Asian Film Awards Academy ever since.

He has been chairman of the Hong Kong International Film Festival Society for 20 years and was chairman of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council for 11.Karena Lam turned to pottery in the pandemic. It’s helped her acting career

“I was lucky, because in every job I had the boss thought it was useful for me to be recognised in the community!” he jokes. “So after 20 years I know most of the people in the movie industry.”

And in addition to “giving the younger generation of moviemakers the right exposure and opportunity in as many ways as possible”, he is impatient to see their ideas take shape.

WASHINGTON - Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued the below statement on his vote to fully fund the government for Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24).

""Congress' most basic job is to keep the federal government - a service to the American people - open, and vital programs, up and running. Appropriators passed all 12 funding bills out of committee, yet Congress kicked the can down the road and wasted time it could have used to process bills through regular order and open debate,"" Grassley said. ""Americans deserve better. Congress must work diligently on Fiscal Year 2025 funding to avert a similar situation this fall.""

Congress enacted the first six of twelve FY24 appropriations bills on March 8, which funded approximately 30 percent of the government. This second package includes the other six bills and accounts for the remaining 70 percent, including defense.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote - 74-24 - came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that US congress would pass the legislation and the President would sign it on Saturday.

The statement said: ""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill.

Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the house of representatives, which had already broken up for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight, senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

Mr Schumer said: ""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While US congress has already approved money for veterans affairs, interior, agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the defence, homeland security and state departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill on Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Mr Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation on Friday. It addresses funding for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch through this fiscal year.

The White House stated earlier that shutdown preparations have ended and that U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" said the statement.

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session thanks to stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline.

The U.S. Congress appropriates funds for federal agencies to operate each fiscal year. Without signed appropriations or a continuing resolution, federal agencies must ease normal spending, described as a ""shutdown."" The duration and reasons for shutdowns vary, but they often stem from disagreements between the two political parties over budgetary matters or policy issues.

This is reminiscent of the time when the industry had reached the $7 billion foreign investment limit and had to suspend flows in funds investing in stocks overseas. These limits probably were put in place to limit outflows of foreign currency within a limit to reduce the impact on balance of payments and thereby on the Indian currency, Mehta said.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

The Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) received a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instructing a cessation of new investments in ETFs allocating funds to overseas markets, as per Angel One. This action comes in response to the nearing breach of the upper limit for ETFs set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, currently standing at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Effective from April 1, 2024, fund of funds (FoFs) investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on international markets will be required to halt the acceptance of new investments.

But the funding lapse was brief and technical, having no meaningful impact as the White House said it has ""ceased shutdown preparations"" due to a Senate agreement, which came after Republicans demanded votes on a series of amendments.

The legislation, which passed the House on Friday morning by a vote of 268-134, now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he'll sign it into law. It completes a turbulent government funding process during the divided government, featuring a year of haggling, six months of stopgap bills and intense partisan clashes over money and policy along the way.

Once Biden signs the package into law, the full government will be funded through the end of September, after Congress passed a previous $459 billion tranche of money earlier this month. The total spending level for the fiscal year is $1.659 trillion.

""Nothing's easy these days,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NBC News after midnight while the Senate was voting, but said it was significant for Congress to pass all 12 appropriations bills in a year.

""Given the dysfunction of the House and slim majorities here you know, there's something to be said for the fact that we finally got this done,"" Murphy said.

The new tranche will fund the departments of State, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, among other parts of the government that had not yet been fully funded.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said it was ""typical"" and ""juvenile"" for the Senate to wait until the 11th hour to act on the bill.

Earlier on Friday, the Senate indicated it has sufficient support to get the bill across the finish line following a 78-18 procedural vote that advanced the measure. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced just before the deadline that both parties had reached an agreement to vote on multiple amendments and then final passage of the bill early Saturday morning.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer announced on the Senate floor just before midnight. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, passing four stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline. And at nearly six months into the fiscal year, it's unusually late in the game to be haggling over the funding measures. The latest bill was released Thursday and passed by the House on Friday morning, leaving little time for the Senate to act.

For a while, those talks appeared to fall apart mid-day Friday, with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing the agreement was scuttled by vulnerable Democrats in key Senate races, claiming they don't want to have to vote on amendments that could be used against them in their re-election campaigns.

""The bottom line is Democratic senators running for re-election are scared to vote on amendments,"" Cotton told reporters, adding without providing evidence: ""Jon Tester has said that he would rather have the government shutdown and vote on Sunday night then vote on these amendments for you.""

But Tester, a Democrat who is in a tight re-election race in the red state of Montana that could determine the Senate majority, fired back, telling NBC News, ""That's bulls---.""

The back and forth came to a head when the two senators were talking to different groups of reporters just feet away from each other off the Senate floor.

""Did Cotton say that they're holding amendments because of Jon Tester?"" Tester yelled at Cotton during the exchange. ""Because if he did, he might be full of something that comes off the back of a cow.""

Senators were frustrated by the fact that Congress was able to repeatedly avert funding lapses during this fiscal year alone, but struggled to do so on the final one of this fiscal year.

""It makes me ill,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in an interview, adding that she felt ""like I've had too much sugar and bad pizza"" after Senate Republicans were served those items for lunch.

""If we had had salmon, we would have been thinking because it's like we've all those fine omega 3s,"" she said.

United Arab Emirates (UAE) has solidified its position as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency investment landscape, with recent reports showcasing substantial gains in the sector. According to data, from a leading blockchain analytics firm, UAE investors reaped capital gains amounting to $204 million from their cryptocurrency ventures in 2023.

GCC crypto landscape UAE leads together with, Saudi Arabia

In the broader Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, It stands out as a frontrunner in crypto investment gains, securing the second position after Saudi Arabia. The latter boasted a remarkable $351 million in gains, underscoring the growing traction of digital assets in the Middle East. Notably, no other GCC countries made it to Chainalysis's top 50 list, highlighting dominance in the regional crypto sphere.

Amidst global market fluctuations, 2023 witnessed a significant rebound in the crypto sector, following the tumultuous events of the previous year. Chainalysis reported a total of $37.6 billion in gains for global crypto investors, signifying a robust recovery from the losses incurred in 2022. While this figure falls short of the highs seen during the 2021 bull market, it nonetheless demonstrates renewed investor confidence and market stability.

Bitcoin Dominance and Investor Maturity in UAE

Bitcoin's dominance among investors reveals a significant shift towards established digital assets, marking a pivotal moment in the country's crypto landscape. With an impressive 70% share of total gains in 2023, Bitcoin's appeal underscores a level of maturity and confidence among investors.

This preference for proven performers like Bitcoin and Ethereum mirrors global trends, emphasizing the growing importance of institutional investments in shaping the crypto market.

Kim Grauer, Director of Research at Chainalysis, highlights the nuanced investor sentiment driving this preference, further solidifying the country's position as a key player in the evolving world of digital currencies.

Grauer's insights into the maturity displayed by its investors shed light on their cautious approach, opting for assets with a track record of stability and performance.

Moreover, the relatively smaller fraction attributed to Ripple's XRP underscores a strategic investment approach prevalent among UAE investors. By focusing on assets with proven track records, UAE investors are aligning themselves with a broader trend towards stability and maturity in the crypto market.

Bitcoin's dominance in the UAE signals a growing sophistication among investors and underscores the country's emergence as a significant player in the global crypto scene.

Broader implications for the UAE and beyond

The strong performance of digital assets in countries like India, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which collectively realized gains of $2.07 billion, holds promising implications for the UAE's crypto ecosystem.

Given the substantial population demographic represented by these nations, there exists significant potential for crypto-facilitated cross-border transactions. This trend aligns with the UAE government's forward-looking stance on pioneering innovative financial solutions and fostering international partnerships.

As the UAE emerges as a key player in the global crypto investment scene, the country's preference for established digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum underscores a maturing market. With institutional investments driving transaction volumes and a positive outlook for cross-border crypto transactions, the UAE's crypto community is poised for further growth and innovation in the coming years.

The pool hall windows will also be triple-glazed and new pool covers will be purchased at the popular East Hull venue with money from the government's Swimming Pool Support Fund. Meanwhile, East Riding Leisure centre in Beverley has been awarded £89,930 to improve facilities, while South Holderness Sports Centre will get £187,000 for work including solar panels and new boilers.

They are among 325 swimming pools and leisure centres across England which will receive a share of £60.5m from the Government, with the money aimed at securing long-term financial sustainability, by improving energy efficiency in order to reduce running costs.

For Ennerdale, Hull City Council's cabinet agreed to the funding last month, as well as choosing to progress with a Design and Build scheme for wider works at the centre.

On top of this, the council's cabinet has also pledged funds through its capital budget to go towards rooftop solar panel installations, planned preventative roof maintenance, and replacing the external doors to the facility. The works will commence simultaneously later in the year, ensuring that all the necessary maintenance will be completed swiftly with minimal disruption.

Cllr Rob Pritchard, portfolio holder for culture and leisure at Hull City Council, said: ""Ennerdale Leisure Centre is a much-loved facility in Hull, but unfortunately its building fabric is approaching 40 years old and needs regeneration. The council understands the frustrations of residents and visitors surrounding the closure of the small pool, however we are now looking to take action to address this.

""There would be some short-term disruption with these plans. However, once completed, Ennerdale Leisure Centre will be fully operational once more for all of its users to enjoy.""

The vote tally in the house reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote.

House speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene initiated an effort to oust Mr Johnson as the house began the vote, but held off on further action until the house returns in two weeks. It is the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Mr Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

He viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory"".

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Eric Burlison.

It took legislators six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stop-gap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of veterans affairs, agriculture and the interior, among others, cleared congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about 1.66 trillion dollars (£1.31 billion). That does not include programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

That is about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, Republican leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a one billion dollar (£792 million) increase for Head Start programs and new child care centres for military families.

It has been handed £1.5 million from Westminster that will top up just over £254,000 raised through a crowdfunding campaign.

One trustee, Ginnie Atkinson, said another £800,000 had been raised from donors and philanthropists, but she described the UK government funding as ""transformational"".

She said the venue needed modernisation amid complaints the original seats did not provide enough space and were threadbare.

The independent cinema opened in 1979 in a former Presbyterian church and developed a following among movie buffs, partly for its showing of films outside the mainstream.

In 2020 it unveiled ambitious plans for a new cinema in neighbouring Festival Square, but it was forced to close in October 2022 after its owner, the Centre for the Moving Image (CMI) faced a torrent of rising and unsustainable costs.

A campaign to save it was backed by a number of Scottish actors. A business model was created with a board of trustees including some who had worked there for two decades.

The trustees learned on Tuesday that their application for money from the Levelling Up Fund had been approved by the UK government. They are now preparing to sign the lease on 1 May before a refurbishment.

Plans include a complete refit, the addition of a fourth screen for educational use and reducing the seating capacity from 450 to 350 to make it more comfortable. Accessibility inside the building will also be improved.

James Rice, who began working in the box office in 2003 before leaving in 2019, said that without the funding the future would have been uncertain. He said: ""If we hadn't got the grant, I don't know what the outcome would have been.

""A large proportion of what we do is not screened at other cinemas. We have got to this point because of the strength of feeling and support, from letter-writing and public meetings. There's some people who worked here who went on to be film-makers.""

Rice said cinema faced new challenges from streaming services, but added that Edinburgh had seen an increase of 33% turnout in cinemas over the past year compared with 2022.

The Filmhouse described its programme as ""the most ambitious cultural film programme"" outside the British Film Institute on the Southbank in London. It also hosted the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years.

Options for pricing are being explored, including ""pay what you can"", and efforts are being made to ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessibility.

Commenting on the new funding, Ms Atkinson said: ""This is absolutely transformational. When we applied the amount was aspirational. We have to attract new audiences and make it a modern, comfortable cinema experience.

""Our aspiration is to open on October 6, the two-year anniversary of it closing. We are hoping before Christmas.""",dailybusinessgroup.co.uk,news,Daily Business,Terry Murden,0.05098039215686279,448877242,1,https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edinburgh-Filmhouse-DBMS.png,eng-9419284

This is reminiscent of the time when the industry had reached the $7 billion foreign investment limit and had to suspend flows in funds investing in stocks overseas. These limits probably were put in place to limit outflows of foreign currency within a limit to reduce the impact on balance of payments and thereby on the Indian currency, Mehta said.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

The Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) received a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instructing a cessation of new investments in ETFs allocating funds to overseas markets, as per Angel One. This action comes in response to the nearing breach of the upper limit for ETFs set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, currently standing at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Effective from April 1, 2024, fund of funds (FoFs) investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on international markets will be required to halt the acceptance of new investments.

These limits probably were put in place to limit outflows of foreign currency within a limit to reduce the impact on balance of payments and thereby on the Indian currency, Mehta said.

""The result will be that these mutual fund schemes will have to limit their inflows. It's been a long time since these limits were set and are probably due for enhancement,"" he said.

The Association of Mutual Funds India (AMFI) received a directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) instructing a cessation of new investments in ETFs allocating funds to overseas markets, as per Angel One. This action comes in response to the nearing breach of the upper limit for ETFs set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for overseas investments, currently standing at $1 billion out of a total industry-wide limit of $7 billion.

Effective from April 1, 2024, fund of funds (FoFs) investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on international markets will be required to halt the acceptance of new investments.

Coun. George Darouze, chair of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, had asked staff about plans to install traffic lights at 19 different intersections in the city's rural wards; specifically, which intersections, how long those intersections have been waiting, and how much it would cost.

To the latter, the answer is not cheap.

""Staff have estimated that a high-level amount of approximately $65 million in 2024 dollars is required to implement traffic signals or roundabouts at the warranted locations in rural areas,"" the response, prepared for the April 4 meeting said. ""This high-level cost estimate includes design and construction however; the estimate does not include potential property acquisition costs.""

Staff identified 13 intersections in rural-designated wards and six intersections that are in rural areas in other wards. These intersections represent more than half of the 36 locations across the city waiting for traffic lights to be installed.

Some of these intersections have been approved for lights for years, but still don't have them. The average time the 19 intersections have been in the queue for traffic lights is 5 years, 9 months. The intersection of Roger Stevens Drive and Nixon Drive at River Road was warranted for lights just last October, but the intersection of Eagleson Road and Flewellyn Road was approved in May 2008, nearly 16 years ago.

The main issue holding them back is funding.

""If the existing 19 rural locations were prioritized for signal installation city wide, and the funding source was limited to an annual investment of approximately $2.7 million (in 2024 dollars) from the New Traffic Control Devices (NTCD) program, it would take approximately 24 years to retrofit all intersections with the warranted traffic controls,"" staff said.

Steps have been taken to speed this process up, however. The city's Road Safety Action Plan (RSAP) provides supplemental funding to the traffic control devices program, to the tune of $3 million in 2024. If that extra cash were to continue, staff say it could cut the time required to install traffic lights at the intersections to 11 years, and the extra cash brought in by photo radar could potentially speed up the process even more.

""With increasing automated speed enforcement revenues, annual RSAP investments in the NTCD Program to address warranted intersections will continue to increase over the coming years. Increased funding will help expedite timelines to retrofit warranted locations with needed traffic control signals,"" said staff.

Ottawa's photo radar cameras issued a record 220,789 speeding tickets, bringing in more than $14 million in revenue.

Staff noted, however, that the number of locations approved for traffic lights will grow over the years and the priority list for installation is updated annually.

""Once a location meets the minimum warrants for traffic signals, it is added to the New Traffic Control Devices (NTCD) Program list of warranted traffic signals. The list is prioritized based on several factors including level of warrant criteria met, collision rates, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) volumes, roadway speed and environment,"" staff said. ""The ranking of each warranted location can fluctuate over time as new traffic data is collected and reassessed and as new locations become warranted. The priority list includes all warranted traffic signal locations, whether in urban, suburban, or rural areas.""

The following is the list of the 19 rural intersections approved for traffic lights and the year they were first approved.

The EU forZeign policy chief on Friday hailed the resumption of funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from more countries.

Following the unproven Israeli accusation that some UNRWA staffers were involved in the Oct. 7 attacks, many countries suspended payments to the aid agency in late January, pending an investigation.

Earlier in the day, Finland decided to resume funding for the UNRWA.

Earlier this month, the European Commission announced that it would release €50 million ($54.7 million) in UNRWA funding.

Shortly after the commission announced its decision, Sweden and Canada also resumed aid, citing the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly more than 70 years ago to assist Palestinians who were forcibly displaced from their land.

Israel has waged a deadly military offensive on Gaza since an Oct. 7 cross-border attack led by Hamas in which nearly 1,200 Israelis were killed.

More than 32,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have since been killed in Gaza, and nearly 74,300 injured amid mass destruction and shortages of necessities.",yenisafak.com,news,Yeni Şafak,"Yeni Şafak, Piri Medya A.Ş.",-0.1529411764705882,448876785,1,https://img.piri.net/piri/upload/3/2024/3/23/b7bfa331-kmasf2ynsexy67nbdzzq7.jpeg,eng-9412421

Credits: Newshub

The chief executive of Whaikaha - Ministry of Disabled People has apologised directly to the disabled community for the stress and anxiety caused by this week's changes to disabled people's funding.

But those out in protest on Saturday said it's provided little comfort after what they're calling a betrayal of their people.

Whaikaha CEO Paula Tesoriero made a direct apology to the disabled community after changes to purchasing rules for equipment, respite care and out-of-town accommodation caused alarm among those affected.

""We know that the way we went about announcing these changes caused stress and anxiety. And for that I am sorry,"" Tesoriero said.

""Here's my pledge to you now. We are doing all we can to help clarify these changes.""

But those protesting outside Christopher Luxon's electorate office today say it's little comfort.

""Families are really hurting and disabled people have been desperate all week. We feel all the promises that were made with the set-up on Whaikaha have been undermined by this,"" said protest organiser Nicola Owen.

After the very public backlash to the changes earlier this week, the minister announced a partial U-turn, allowing the fund to be used for essential tools and regional travel.

But advocates say they want the changes fully reversed.

""A slogan that Governments for many decades have accepted is 'nothing about us without us' and this has been done without us,"" Owen said.

""We're hurting, we need an apology and a commitment this won't happen again.""

Minister for Disabled People Penny Simmonds echoed her apology about the communication again today.

""Neither Whaikaha nor I are happy with the way this has occurred and so we are very clear that we will have to do much better in the future,"" she said.

It is not uncommonly felt that the professional contribution of the advisory economist should be restricted to investigating the consequences of different acts in a decision situation. Naturally even such limited tasks have to be related to the goals applicable in the relevant situation, but it could be claimed that the decision-maker should be solely responsible for precisely formulating his goals, thus furnishing the starting-point for the economist's work. Obviously advice will be impossible unless the decision-maker broadly outlines his goal(s) and relevant courses of action. The task of the economist (the advisor) will then be to substitute for such a broad description a formal decision model which the decion-maker can accept. And in accepting the model as a whole, he naturally accepts too the goal function embodied in it. This necessary acceptance does not prevent the economist from playing just as active a role in the detailed formulation of the goals as in the specification of acts and the precise description of the various outcomes. The close relation between these elements in the model provides confirmation of this. The class of decision models that we shall discuss are deterministic (i.e. they contain no stochastic variables) and concern the firm's choice between different investment and financing alternatives. A considerable amount of literature on this subject already exists and it seems important even at this early stage to point out in a general way how the present work fits into the picture. It may be said that a well established investment theory exists only for the special case of the firm functioning in a perfect capital market. In such a market all the participants agree in a definite conception of the investment opportunities and their consequences. The firm can therefor borrow on the various investments up to the discounted value of the future net receipts. The rate of interest is the same for borrowing and lending for all firms and persons on the market. It is also normally regarded as constant over time. There are no transaction costs. Under these circumstances writers are unanimous in declaring that when an economically rational decision-maker evaluates the investments open to him, he should rank them according to their present value at the market rate of interest. What, then, can be said about firms working in a capital market with credit restrictions, different rates of interest, taxes and other market imperfections? How are they to formulate their goals? It is our view that statements so far to be found in the literature are generally based on the rather loose analogies with the case of the perfect capital market. Our aim here is to develop two reasonable analogies somewhat more fully than has been usual before. Contents . CHAPTER 1 .

Groups in the county can apply for up to £8,300 from the Prime Foundation's annual fund.

The foundation was established to improve education, health, and social wellbeing at community levels.

Causes where Prime, a health and care property developer, has erected new facilities form the core targets for the funding.

The grants also serve to support initiatives close to the foundation's birthplace, Worcestershire.

In the previous year, three community initiatives, including STEPWAY, a charity dedicated to veterans and their families, have received funding.

Using the funds it was able to build a large shed on a pontoon with the aid of the acquired funding - offering safekeeping for machinery, as well as quieter office spaces.

Stepway's CEO, Dawn Turner, said: ""The funding received from the Prime Foundation has transformed and enhanced support services at the Stepway community garden.

""The office and workshop will benefit veterans, family members and the local community.""

Unfortunately, vandalism befell the shed last year, which consequently led to multiple acts of aid, including the foundation's financial aid for the installation of monitoring equipment to enhance site security.

The Worcester Child Contact Centre, another beneficiary of the fund, had its facilities upgraded.

The funding saw the development of a parent-child reading zone full of books, toys, furniture, games, and crafts.

Lastly, the Lido Park Tennis Club had an influx of equipment which sparked the start of a club for homeschooled children and teens in Droitwich Spa.

Hannah Cashmore, a trustee of the foundation, said: ""We've witnessed the profound impact of our funding on local groups year-on-year, and we're eager to open applications for community-led projects once again.

The Board, consisting of member country ministers of finance, industry and economic affairs, also offered guidance for NIB's priorities towards a sustainable, innovative and resilient Nordic-Baltic region. Finance Minister Arvils Ašeradens was resent to represent Latvia.

In 2023, NIB paid out EUR 3.4 billion in loans. NIB's net profit increased by 80% from EUR 139.3 million in 2022 to EUR 250.7 million in 2023. The strong financial results allowed the Bank to distribute EUR 63 million as dividends to its Nordic and Baltic member states.

It also underlines the Bank's ability to add value not only through leveraging investments in the region but also by bringing the capital back to the state budgets,"" said Mart Võrklaev, Chair of the Board of Governors of NIB and Minister of Finance of Estonia.

The meeting in Tallinn was the first to be held in person since Vilnius 2013. Three themes -climate and nature, productivity and innovation, security and resilience - were identified as the most critical future focus areas. The Governors released a statement to express their support for these priorities in guiding NIB's operations, which can be read below.

It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said.

""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it."" While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defence, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70 per cent of the money would go to defence.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government"".

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown.

Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory."" Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about USD 1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24 per cent increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a USD 1 billion increase for Head Start programmes and new child care centres for military families. They also played up a USD 120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a USD 100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defence programmes actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted"".

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a US$1.2 trillion, six-Bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defence and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2am local time in Washington.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the Bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare manoeuvre that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall - and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 per cent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 per cent - covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing - passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six Bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

These deals include nine growth-stage deals and 11 early-stage deals. Two early-stage startups kept their transaction details undisclosed.

Last week, about 30 early and growth-stage startups collectively raised around $287 million, including four undisclosed deals.

[Growth-stage deals]

Among the growth-stage deals, nine startups raised $420.35 million in funding this week. Healthtech firm Engrail led the pack with $157 million in funding. Audio series platform Pocket FM, healthtech startup Ultrahuman, and content-to-commerce company The Good Glamm Group followed with $103 million, $35 million, and $30 million funding, respectively.

Further, data collaboration software provider Atlan, cloud kitchen startup Curefood, B2B marketplace and retail platform Jumbotail, NBFC operating in remote rural parts, Dvara KGFS, and coffee brand SubKo Coffee also raised funds this week.

[Early-stage deals]

As many as 11 early-stage startups scooped funding worth $27 million during the week. MSME-focused lending-tech startup Optimo Loan topped the list followed by gaming startup Liquidnitro, boutique hotels firm Brij Hotels, and climate tech platform Sprih.

The list further includes networking solution provider HCIN Network, AI music startup Beatoven.ai, B2B furniture cloud factory Relso, fintech firm Yenmo, and jewellery brand Jewelbox among others.

The list of early-stage startups also includes two startup that kept the amount undisclosed. The startups are Droom and Dairy Day. For more information, visit TheKredible.

[City and segment-wise deals]

In terms of the city-wise number of funding deals, Bengaluru-based startups led with 14 deals followed by Delhi-NCR with 3 deals. Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad are next on the list.

The complete breakdown of the city and segment can be found at TheKredible.

[Series-wise deals]

This week, seed funding deals are on the top spot with five deals. Four startups raised funding in Series B, followed by three pre-seed, three Series A, and two Series D deals.

On a weekly basis, startup funding grew 56% to $447.35 million across 22 deals. Last week, 30 startups raised around $287 million in funding.

The average funding in the last eight weeks stands at around $254 million with 26 deals per week.

[Mergers and Acquisitions]

This week witnessed only one acquisition deal. French influencer marketing firm YKONE acquired a 70% stake in Barcode, a content and influencer marketing agency for an undisclosed amount this week.

[Fund launches]

The week witnessed three startup-focused fund launches.

American investment firm Alphatron Capital, which primarily makes limited partner-style bets on venture capital firms in India, has closed its maiden fund and received $30 million in commitments from its limited partners (LPs) for the fund.

US-based multi-stage venture capital firm B Capital made the final close of its second opportunities fund with aggregate capital commitments of $750 million.

Cedar Capital, the fintech-focused venture capital arm of management consulting firm Cedar and fintech market intelligence platform IBS Intelligence, also marked the first close of its $30 million FinTech Venture Capital fund, raising capital in the range of Rs 50 to 75 crore.

[Shutdown and Layoff]

OKX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of trading volume, is shutting down its services in India. Citing local regulatory hurdles, the Seychelles-headquartered exchange notified its users in the country to close their accounts and redeem funds before April 30.

Prosus-backed virtual events platform Airmeet laid off around 20% of its entire workforce earlier this week, as part of its second restructuring exercise within a year, people aware of the matter informed Inc42 on the condition of anonymity.

After the stagnant funding in the past few week, the weekly funding grew 57% and crossed $450 million. In a positive development, this week again three VC firms launched startup-focused funds to support Indian entrepreneurs. While the layoffs and shutdowns reappeared this week as crypto exchange OKX is shutting down its services in India and virtual events platform Airmeet laid off around 20% of its entire workforce.

Co-founders of AI-focused startup Builder.ai have reportedly been booked by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with two separate criminal cases. Sachin Dev Duggal is named as a suspect in an alleged money laundering case, while Saurabh Dhoot is linked to an alleged loan fraud case. Duggal's involvement stems from the ED's money laundering probe into the now-bankrupt electronics giant Videocon. The agency issued a summons to Duggal in 2022 to appear as a witness in the probe into alleged ""unexplained transactions"" between his company (not Builder.ai) and Videocon.

Moreover, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting advised endorsers and influencers on social media to refrain from promoting or advertising offshore online betting and gambling platforms. The ministry also directed online advertisement intermediaries not to target such promotional content towards the Indian audience. Failure to comply may lead to proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, including removal or disabling of social media posts or accounts and penal action under applicable statutes.

That has been on the minds of European officials for a long time, as they gaze across the Atlantic and see funds being blocked and the potential return of Donald Trump.

It's a question the European Union is attempting to answer. At a European Council summit this week, the bloc agreed to explore new ways to raise funds for Ukraine - including by raising debt on financial markets and, controversially, using profits from frozen Russian assets.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that there was ""openness, at least on our side"" to new ways of funding, and pointedly added that Europe cannot ""wait for the US to make up our minds.""

However, leaders stopped short of agreeing any new money for weapons. That could be a problem.

The urgency of Ukraine's need for weapons is increasingly acute. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly told his Western allies that the biggest challenge the country faces right now is a weapons deficit that has allowed Russia to take advantage.

It would be unfair to accuse the EU of not pulling its weight on Ukraine. Despite public disagreements between the 27 member states on things like sending tanks and whether money should come directly from the EU budget, the bloc as a whole has sent more money to Kyiv than the US, according to the Kiel Institute's Ukraine Support Tracker.

However, the same tracker also shows that only $5.6bn of the EU's total $85bn has been specifically allocated for military aid, compared to $2.2bn on humanitarian aid and $77.1bn on financial aid.

And with $60bn of US military aid to Ukraine stuck in Congress for the foreseeable future, it's not immediately clear who could feasibly plug that funding gap.

This is where the core question, can Europe really stand in for the US, gets complicated.

Some European officials like to frame this as a purely economic question. The World Bank's most recent data puts Russia's GDP at $2.24 trillion, compared to the EU's $16.75 trillion.

On paper, this means that Europe can hypothetically outlast Russia if the war becomes one of economic attrition. Or more crudely: yes, Europe does have the money to plug the American gap.

The difficulty is in how this works politically. The EU is made up of 27 sovereign states who all have an independent foreign policy. Some are members of NATO, some are not and are officially neutral. Some are comfortable with buying US weapons and sending them to Ukraine for the specific purpose of killing Russian soldiers, others are not. Some are geographically close to Russia and worry about war spilling over to their borders, others are protected by miles of land between them and Moscow and have enjoyed decades of good economic relations with Russia.

Over the course of the war, European thinking has evolved. Diplomats and officials say that earlier in the conflict, Brussels' role had been understood as providing financial aid for things like keeping basic functions of state running and hosting refugees, while the US would sort the weapons.

It is undeniable that the EU is taking defense more seriously. It recently unveiled a plan to finally build up a European defense industry that could rival that of the US in the future. But even this long-term plan, still a long way from becoming reality, asks uncomfortable questions of member states. Should EU money be spent outside the bloc? Where should factories be built? What kind of relationship should procurement plans have with initiatives NATO already has?

That's all for the long-term: In the short-term, Ukraine needs weapons urgently. CNN reported last week that Russia is producing three times more artillery shells than the US and Europe combined for use in Ukraine.

An initiative led by the Czech Republic - supported by a further 17 EU member states - has been put together outside of the EU's structures to buy ammunition on the international markets that will be sent to Ukraine.

The virtue of not being an official EU plan means that they can move much faster and don't have to worry about their fellow member states - chiefly Hungary, which has a closer relationship with Russia than the rest of the EU - vetoing or watering down plans.

The Czech initiative has already purchased 300,000 artillery rounds and it is expected they will arrive in Ukraine in June. The Ukrainians, of course, are delighted at the initiative, but also acknowledge that it won't plug the US-shaped hole.

Earlier this month, Ukraine's Foreign Minister said: ""The Czech initiative is great but it's far from sufficient... If, besides the Czech initiative, two more initiatives are implemented this year... the Russian troops in Ukraine will face more significant problems on the front line."" This was seen by some as a reference to the blocked US package.

So, can Europe fill the funding void in Ukraine left by Washington DC?

The answer is yes, Europe has the means. Whether it has the will is the bigger unknown.

Officials from Eastern European countries stress the importance of convincing their counterparts that Ukrainian security is the same thing as European security. While former Soviet states are often painted as hawks in Western Europe, they make the somewhat reasonable point that if Russia were to invade NATO territory, bombs would most likely fall on them, not in Athens or Rome, for example.

But it would affect all European countries, especially those in NATO. And those countries who share borders with Russia almost universally share the view that the only way to ensure Russia doesn't expand its aggression is by making NATO so strong an attack would be unthinkable, even to President Vladimir Putin.

Making this case for dramatic increases in defense spending is hard enough even while there is a war on European borders. NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the news last month that 18 of the allies would spend 2% of GDP on defense. It was a dramatic improvement from a decade ago, when only three NATO countries met the minimum threshold. But it still means that even during a crisis like the one in Ukraine, more than a third are not meeting this target.

The longer the war drags on, the more likely fatigue is to set in. The more pressures on domestic budgets for things like public services and pensions, the harder it becomes to justify giving another country money to fight a war.

And that is exactly the point at which European thinking can go one of two ways: ensure Ukraine defeats Russia for the sake of the wider continent, or ask, what does it have to do with us?

Yes, Europe can fill the gap left by the US - and in some respects is trying to do just that. But it all depends whether Ukraine's biggest allies in Europe can keep winning the argument.

But the funding lapse was brief and technical, having no meaningful impact as the White House said it has ""ceased shutdown preparations"" due to a Senate agreement, which came after Republicans demanded votes on a series of amendments.

The legislation, which passed the House on Friday morning by a vote of 268-134, now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he'll sign it into law. It completes a turbulent government funding process during the divided government, featuring a year of haggling, six months of stopgap bills and intense partisan clashes over money and policy along the way.

Once Biden signs the package into law, the full government will be funded through the end of September, after Congress passed a previous $459 billion tranche of money earlier this month. The total spending level for the fiscal year is $1.659 trillion.

""Nothing's easy these days,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NBC News after midnight while the Senate was voting, but said it was significant for Congress to pass all 12 appropriations bills in a year.

""Given the dysfunction of the House and slim majorities here you know, there's something to be said for the fact that we finally got this done,"" Murphy said.

The new tranche will fund the departments of State, Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, among other parts of the government that had not yet been fully funded.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said it was ""typical"" and ""juvenile"" for the Senate to wait until the 11th hour to act on the bill.

Earlier on Friday, the Senate indicated it has sufficient support to get the bill across the finish line following a 78-18 procedural vote that advanced the measure. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced just before the deadline that both parties had reached an agreement to vote on multiple amendments and then final passage of the bill early Saturday morning.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer announced on the Senate floor just before midnight. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal.""

The divided Congress has narrowly averted multiple shutdowns this session, passing four stopgap bills that kept extending the deadline. And at nearly six months into the fiscal year, it's unusually late in the game to be haggling over the funding measures. The latest bill was released Thursday and passed by the House on Friday morning, leaving little time for the Senate to act.",cnbc.com,news,CNBC,"Frank Thorp V, Sahil Kapur, Kate Santaliz",0.05098039215686279,448874724,1,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107391871-1711178160103-gettyimages-2105291181-_m021425_3hkbmdty.jpeg?v=1711178293&w=1920&h=1080,eng-9411206

The US Congress approved a funding bill Saturday in a rare show of cross-party unity, keeping federal agencies running through September and averting a damaging partial government shutdown.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package to keep the lights on in several key government agencies but voted in the early hours to pass a resolution that had already advanced from the House.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it,"" Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation.

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like they were breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces former president Donald Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate voted to pass the resolution after 2:00 am local time (0600 GMT) in Washington.

- Shutdown preparations 'ceased' -

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.

The legislation passed 74-24 shortly after 2 a.m. ET and capped off months of bipartisan dealmaking to fund the government through Sept. 30.

The bill unveiled Thursday funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, State, Education, and the legislative branch. It covers roughly 70% of the federal government and, with its passage, brings a close to the fiscal 2024 appropriations process, nearly six months after it began.

The upper chamber hit a stalemate Friday evening as Republicans demanded multiple amendment votes related to immigration and the border in exchange for speeding up the process. Cooperation from all 100 senators was required to come to an agreement in order to fast-track the massive spending package ahead of the Friday night deadline.

Government funding formally lapsed at midnight, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor about 15 minutes before the shutdown deadline to announce a deal had been reached on amendment votes and final passage.

The White House's Office of Management and Budget called off formal shutdown preparations shortly after midnight because ""there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday.""

Lawmakers have struggled to get over the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by a divided Congress that required several short-term, stopgap funding bills to keep agencies funded.

The bipartisan compromise legislation had been touted as a win by both Republican and Democratic leaders. However, the vote in the House on Friday angered many Republicans over the contents of the bill and how quickly it moved.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) brought the package to the floor, even though a majority of Republicans voted against it, prompting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) to initiate an effort to oust Johnson.

Congress now heads for a two-week spring break, but Greene's resolution awaits Johnson when the House returns from recess in April.

The technical summary data tells us to buy GTES near 15.05, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 15.01 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 15.05 is the first level of support below 17.64, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 15.05 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.

NONE .

There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance. Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

If 18.29 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy GTES just slightly over 18.29, with an upside target of n/a. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 18.24 in case the stock turns against the trade. 18.29 is the first level of resistance above 17.64, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 18.29, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of GTES if it tests 18.29 with a downside target of 17.51. We should have a stop loss in place at 18.34 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance, 18.29, is being tested a short signal would exist. Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

If 17.77 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy GTES just slightly over 17.77, with an upside target of 18.29. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 17.73 in case the stock turns against the trade. 17.77 is the first level of resistance above 17.64, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 17.77, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.

The technical summary data is suggesting a short of GTES if it tests 17.77 with a downside target of 17.53.

According to Dan Dees, Goldman Sachs Group's co-head of global banking and markets, the conditions for deals have started to improve, German industrial companies are exploring options to expand - albeit in the US - and the startup scene is about as vibrant as anywhere else.

""The mood among executives at German industrial companies is constructive, but definitely more sober compared to the optimism of peers in the US and specifically the West Coast,"" Dees told Bloomberg News in a recent interview.

Dees, 53, just returned from a visit to Goldman Sachs's office in Frankfurt and its newly opened branch in Munich, where he said a growing number of tech startups - from artificial intelligence to health technology and gaming - promise to spur deal flow and massive investments in infrastructure.

""Every sovereign country wants to build and own AI capability, which will need chips, data centers and related infrastructure,"" Dees said.

Germany has been struggling to revive its economy after the energy crisis, softening global demand and long-simmering structural challenges like an outdated bureacracy and aging workforce came to the fore. The list of problems has raised questions about the country's ability to remain competitive and attract investment.

Now, amid signs that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates in the coming months, German investor confidence is back up, rising this month to the highest in more than two years. Lowering borrowing costs would be a key catalyst for companies to scale up and boost tech spending on process automation and AI - areas that Dees says German executives are keen to support.

With improving sentiment and interest rates, deals activity is finally starting to pick up after a difficult year. Global deal values are up 24 per cent this year to US$651 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deals involving companies from Europe, Middle East and Africa are up 44 per cent.

Dees cautioned, however, that it's too early to tell whether deal making will continue to improve at this pace. It ""doesn't take heroic assumptions to see that deals are picking up after a 10-year low because of stabilizing interest rates, economic stability and the combination of dry powder and having assets to sell on the side of the sponsor community.""

Analysts say Germany is in the midst of a recession after contracting in the final three months of last year and, they predict, the first quarter of 2024. The country's recent poor economic performance - lagging all other G-7 industrial countries - has revived the moniker 'Sick man of Europe,' which was used to describe Germany's anemic growth around the turn of the century before structural reforms were pushed through.

Dees, though, rejected the label, saying the general sentiment among German executives, asset managers and startup founders ""was better than what I had expected.""

During his trip to Europe, Dees also met tech industry leaders in London this month and was encouraged by the progress in a sector that's dominated by US giants like Microsoft and Apple.

""Over the last decade we have seen significant growth in the European tech sector, with the number of unicorns in Europe growing to a record 260,"" he said.

Dees expects alternative asset managers like infrastructure funds to contribute to the build-up of the related technology needed for AI and other innovation on a large scale in coming years.

His comments echoed those of Raj Agrawal, global head of infrastructure at KKR & Co., who said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week that investments in Europe's technology infrastructure poised to surge.

""Europe is one of the most advanced in terms of mobility, handsets, fiber connectivity - so the data usage needs are there. We're just way behind in Europe,"" Agrawal said. ""So there's a tremendous growth story ahead for Europe and data center infrastructure.""

TSMC is currently building a chip factory in Germany, and the federal government in Berlin is also in advanced talks to buy the domestic business of Dutch grid operator Tennet in a deal that could be valued at around 22 billion euro (S$32.2 billion).

Additionally, Dees expects activist investors to push for deals. ""One out of six companies in the S&P 500 has an activist shareholder"" and many of these typically call for breaking up traditional company structures to boost efficiencies, he said.

""We have just opened an office in Munich, which has a vibrant tech start-up scene that is just about as optimistic as their peers elsewhere,"" he said.

China will make greater efforts to diffuse debt risks of financing platforms, said Chinese premier Li Qiang in a meeting focusing on mitigating risks of local government debt on Friday.

China will resolutely block the path for irregular and disguised debts and strictly prevent the risk of newly-added debts, said Li.

The Commerce ministry said on Friday that foreign investment into China fell 19.9% in the first two months of 2024 from the amount in January-February last year to 215 billion yuan ($30 billion).

China on Tuesday unveiled new steps to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment, including expanding market access and relaxing some rules.

Overseas firms have turned sour on China since it enacted ultra-strict COVID curbs during the pandemic then suddenly abandoned them in late 2022, with concerns over the business environment, a shaky economic recovery and rising geopolitical tensions with the West weighing on confidence.

A series of prolonged regulatory crackdowns on sectors from technology to education have also rattled domestic and foreign investors, adding to unease over policy transparency in China.

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last year that American businesses had told her that China was becoming ""uninvestible.""

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China shank 8% year-on-year.

Of the foreign investment in the first two months, 71.44 billion yuan, or a third of the total, went into China's high-tech industries, including high-tech manufacturing, the ministry said.

Foreign investment in China's construction sector rose 43.6% year-on-year, while investment in wholesale and retail industries grew 14.5%, it added.

In return, China's central government accelerated spending at the start of the year, a sign it's taking on more financing responsibility to support the economy and to avoid worsening local government debt risks, Bloomberg reported.

Its general public expenditure jumped 14% from a year earlier to 482.8 billion yuan ($66.8 billion) in January and February combined, the fastest pace for the period in five years, according to data provided by the Ministry of Finance.

Bloomberg said Beijing is gradually shifting the responsibility for supporting economic growth to central government from local officials -- a way to maintain the level of investment while defusing local debt risks.

Local governments have been struggling after a property crisis reduced a critical source of income from land sales, and a slowing economy weighed on tax revenues.

The latest data shows Beijing intends to ""underpin growth while preventing risks,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.

Central and local authorities spent almost 700 billion yuan in the first two months on agriculture, forest and irrigation-related issues, as well as urban and rural community development. This is up 22% from a year earlier.

In a separate development, China's securities regulator launched onsite inspections of some mutual fund companies as part of efforts to strengthen management of the industry, unnerving fund managers.

The securities watchdog, under newly appointed Chairman Wu Qing, vowed a week ago to set up a ""textbook-style"" supervision model to regulate China's $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry, according to Reuters.

The latest round of inspections, conducted without notice by branches of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), covered daily operations, training, and strengthening internal Chinese Communist Party functions, the 21st Century Business Herald reported on Friday. It did not name the asset managers inspected.

In response to a Reuters query, CSRC said: ""It's regular on-site inspection that we conduct every year.""

The CSRC branches inspected fund companies based outside their regions, which the article said can prevent local interference. Regulators have recently cracked down on computer-driven ""quant"" private funds.",english.aawsat.com,news,Asharq Al-Awsat English,,-0.2156862745098039,448873803,1,https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2024-03/584929_0.jpeg,eng-9410259

This decision, supported by President Joe Biden and the Democratic-controlled upper chamber of Congress, showcases a complete disregard for the suffering of the Palestinian people.

It is deeply concerning that this bill was passed with the support of far-right Republicans who believe that it does not go far enough in curbing government spending. It is clear that their priorities lie in reducing government expenditure rather than addressing the urgent needs of those in desperate situations.

The passage of this bill is an incredible moral failure and a failure of our political process. By cutting funding to the only entity that can provide assistance to the suffering in Gaza, the US government has turned its back on its responsibility to alleviate the level of suffering and scale of the crisis.

Furthermore, the bill comes at a time when the United Nations has been warning of the growing risk of famine in Gaza due to the Israeli blockade. Children have already died of dehydration and starvation, and yet the US government has chosen to ignore these pleas for help.

It is disheartening to see that many progressives have also supported this de-funding of UNRWA, despite the vital services it provides to Palestinians in Gaza and across the Middle East. Accusing Israel of committing ""some of the most horrific crimes against humanity,"" Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib fails to acknowledge the complexities of the situation and the need for a comprehensive approach to finding a lasting solution.

Senator Chris Van Hollen's disappointment and frustration at the ban on funding UNRWA is warranted. Denying funding for UNRWA is equivalent to denying food to starving people and restricting medical supplies to injured civilians. It also means cutting support for essential services such as schooling and healthcare for over a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.

While Israel has accused UNRWA of ties to Hamas, these allegations have been rejected by the agency and major humanitarian groups. The Israeli government's claims have prompted Western countries, including the US, to pause aid to UNRWA. However, a report released by UNRWA revealed that Israeli forces tortured several of its staff members to force them to admit to links with Hamas.

It is unconscionable and politically motivated to de-fund an agency that provides essential services to Palestinian refugees. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rightly points out that this decision is not grounded in sound facts. It is disheartening to see the Biden administration endorsing this bill and continuing to withhold funds from UNRWA.

This de-funding of UNRWA is part of a larger effort by Israel to deligitimize the agency and erase the plight of Palestinian refugees. It is shocking that the US government, under President Biden's leadership, is complicit in this push to erase the rights and suffering of Palestinian refugees.

The Biden administration's policy on this issue has been tragically flawed since October 7. Instead of course-correcting and rectifying the harm done to the US's international standing, they have chosen to further exacerbate the situation. This decision is not only detrimental to the Palestinian people but also to the reputation and credibility of the US on the world stage.

It is crucial to hold our government accountable for its actions and demand a more compassionate and just approach to addressing the needs of Palestinian refugees. The de-funding of UNRWA must be condemned, and efforts to restore funding and support for essential services must be prioritized. The suffering of the Palestinian people cannot be ignored any longer.",dcweekly.org,news,DC Weekly,,-0.2784313725490196,448873797,1,https://dcweekly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Moral_failure___US_House_approves_bill_that_would_ban_UNRWA_funding.webp,eng-9412421

""It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" he added before the bill received final approval.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday at lunchtime, representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement after the deal was struck.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson can not take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN that ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.",urdupoint.com,news,UrduPoint,,0.04313725490196085,448873743,1,https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png,spa-3422544

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

By Andrea Shalal

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A $1.2 trillion government funding bill passed by Congress will allow the U.S. to lend up to $21 billion to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) trust to help the world's poorest countries, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Saturday.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

Congress approved the bill with a Senate vote after midnight, avoiding a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise President Joe Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

Wrexham owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have been given further proof of the outstanding job they have done so far.

Less than three years after taking over, the actors oversaw the Welsh club winning promotion to the Football League for the first time since 2008 last season. They are now locked in a fight to win promotion to League One.

The team's success has captivated the locals and football fans around the world. Their Hollywood owners certainly will have the funds to improve the club due to its improved value, according to club director Shaun Harvey.

Harvey recently revealed that Wrexham's value and net worth has significantly increased from £2 million ($2.5m) when they took over, to now sitting at £9 million ($11m). Speaking at the SportNXT conference in Australia, Harvey said: ""It is worth noting [that] it is an investment that has paid off. Now worth £9m.

""The main reason for ownership was the town's history and to provide hope to the town whilst offering something the community could get behind. The social media growth has been astronomical from 2020 to 2024, seeing an increase from 152,000 [followers] to 3,981,747 across all platforms.

""Ultimately, it was exposure, the spotlight that had been shone and all of a sudden, everybody wanted to see what was going on. We successfully managed the football club in the town for the local community and built everything else around it. It remained relatable.""

Reynolds and McElhenney's decision to invest in Wrexham has not only increased the club's financial fortunes, but also raised the profile around the world. This is due to the popular Welcome to Wrexham Netflix series, which has given a behind-the-scenes look at how the club operates, as well as its transformation and gradual rise up the ranks.

Reynolds and McElhenney were present to see Wrexham clinch promotion to the Football League last season

Told from the perspective of the two actors, the program is broadcast on Disney+ and each episode is reported to have garnered more than £400,000. During his interview, Harvey commented on how Wrexham's added exposure has created more opportunities to increase the club's value.

""The ownership and success has now created a spotlight on the Football League and non-league football, making it attractive for overseas investment,"" he added. ""The increased exposure has given us better players and we provide unique selling points for players by providing them with more exposure.""

In a separate conversation with Yahoo Sports about the documentary, Harvey shared: ""Our documentary isn't one that's built around telling the story of elite athletes in a pressure scenario, it's about a football club that's on a journey towards the top. It's a story that resonates with many, many people who can relate to what Wrexham and its supporters are going through in some part of their own life. The town is the underdog in this story, more so than the football club.""

WASHINGTON, DC - Senator James Lankford (R-OK) today issued a statement after the Senate voted on the final six fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills, which include funding for Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs:

""This monster bill has some important policy elements, including a much-deserved raise for our military, mission-critical funding for national defense, and school choice. But with the good, there is some ugly. I have to make hard decisions on every bipartisan agreement and weigh the good and the bad. This is not a bill I can support.

""For over a year I have sounded the alarm about the number of Special Interest Aliens that are designated as a national security risk that are released into the interior of our nation by the Biden Administration with zero oversight. DHS has no idea where the Special Interest Aliens are located or who they are connecting with. We must do something now to protect our national security.

""The bill also egregiously funds hospitals that perform late-term abortions. I know many Americans disagree on the issue of life, but it is past time that at five months of pregnancy, we recognize a child is viable and should be given the opportunity of life. Federal taxpayer dollars should not support facilities that perform late-term abortions.""

Lankford offered amendments to the budget bill to end the release of Special Interest Aliens and withhold funding for late-term abortion facilities. The first would have prohibited funding for the release of ""Special Interest Aliens"" from federal custody until their case has been fully adjudicated, and the second amendment would strike earmarks that provide funding to hospitals that provide late-term abortions up to 22 weeks, which both amendments failed.

The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

""The historic ban on US funding to UNRWA that passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan support, demonstrates what we knew all along: UNRWA is part of the problem and can not be part of the solution,"" Katz writes on X, formerly Twitter.

""UNRWA will not be a part of Gaza's landscape in the aftermath of Hamas. Thousands of UNRWA employees are involved in Hamas terror activities and their facilities were used for terrorist purposes.""

He adds a call for other countries to also ban funding the UN agency for Palestinians, after Israeli surfaced allegations in late January that 12 of UNRWA's employees actively participated in Hamas's October 7 terror onslaught on southern communities, when terrorists murdered some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 253 hostages to Gaza.

Those staffers have already been fired by the agency.

Israel argues that Hamas's infiltration into the agency runs far deeper and that some 1,500 employees (some 10%) have active ties to terror groups.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

They urged the government to prioritise increased funding in public universities instead of establishing new ones.

They made the call at the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences' (GAAS) fifth Higher Education Policy Dialogue in Accra.

The event was dubbed ""Motivating High Education Reforms in Ghana-towards Equity and Sustainability.""

The government recently announced the establishment of four more public universities in Bunso, Akrodea in Ahafo, Kintampo and Mampong Ashanti.

Some of the panelists argued that raising public university expenditures would offer access to higher education, promote Ghana's Free SHS programme, and enhance infrastructure.

Others believed that Ghana should have universities in all 16 regions, and that its public universities should be affiliated with foreign universities.

GAAS policy dialogue was attended by representatives of Ghana's public universities including past vice-chancellors, the Ghana Association of University Administrators (GAUA), the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission and the Graduate Students Association of Ghana (GRASAG).

The dialogue aimed to review Professor Christine Adu-Yeboah, Dr. Adams Yunus, and Dr. Lydia Aframea Dankyi's higher education project.

The panelists noted that certain universities' infrastructure has been halted due to a lack of funds, causing them to admit fewer students or turn them away.

Some prominent universities have larger intake, leading to congestion in facilities, whereas others have minimal enrollment.

The panelists suggested that new universities should align with global trends like artificial intelligence.

During the conversation, it was revealed that South Africa, for example, had developed colleges to handle police and crime detection, science and innovation, air traffic control, agricultural processing, and energy technology, which Ghana could replicate.

Professor Yayra Dzakadzie, Deputy Director-General of the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission, confirmed the government's decision to build four new universities.

According to him, this became necessary because there were 102 private universities, with 80 per cent in Accra and Kumasi.

""We need new Universities as and when the need arises. The government's position of establishing new universities was not a bad one. These universities are donor funded and some are funded by GET Fund. Development partners have adopted some of these universities,' he said.

Prof. Dzakadzie announced that Ghana would soon have Open Universities, which had been planned for some time.

He said the Ministry of Finance would soon give public universities the green light to hire or employ more staff.

Professor Lydia Aziato, Vice Chancellor, University of Health and Allied Sciences, Ho noted that new universities were struggling in terms of Information Communication Technology, roads, and fields for practical.

She called for community and increased government support to address the challenges of new universities.

The GAAS project on Higher Education found that public university education in Ghana had grown significantly during the past 30 years.

Again, there was a significant increase in student enrolment and a ""considerable spatial balance because of the location of new universities spread across the 10 old administrative regions of the country.""

The project also found that the number of public universities increased from five (5) in 1993 to 25 in 2023.

It also revealed an increase in students' enrolment from 15,365 in the 1993/94 academic year to 361,804 in 2022.

This was because of the increase in the number of institutions and the introduction of different entry routes, among others.

""Significant improvement in female enrolment evidenced by a gender parity index from 0.62 in the year 2000 to 0.9 in the year 2020 and a ratio of 35.65 in the year 2021"" the project disclosed.

Groups in the county can apply for up to £8,300 from the Prime Foundation's annual fund.

The foundation was established to improve education, health, and social wellbeing at community levels.

Causes where Prime, a health and care property developer, has erected new facilities form the core targets for the funding.

The grants also serve to support initiatives close to the foundation's birthplace, Worcestershire.

In the previous year, three community initiatives, including STEPWAY, a charity dedicated to veterans and their families, have received funding.

Using the funds it was able to build a large shed on a pontoon with the aid of the acquired funding - offering safekeeping for machinery, as well as quieter office spaces.

Stepway's CEO, Dawn Turner, said: ""The funding received from the Prime Foundation has transformed and enhanced support services at the Stepway community garden.

""The office and workshop will benefit veterans, family members and the local community.""

Unfortunately, vandalism befell the shed last year, which consequently led to multiple acts of aid, including the foundation's financial aid for the installation of monitoring equipment to enhance site security.

The Worcester Child Contact Centre, another beneficiary of the fund, had its facilities upgraded.

The funding saw the development of a parent-child reading zone full of books, toys, furniture, games, and crafts.

Lastly, the Lido Park Tennis Club had an influx of equipment which sparked the start of a club for homeschooled children and teens in Droitwich Spa.

Hannah Cashmore, a trustee of the foundation, said: ""We've witnessed the profound impact of our funding on local groups year-on-year, and we're eager to open applications for community-led projects once again.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A $1.2 trillion government funding bill passed by Congress will allow the U.S. to lend up to $21 billion to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) trust to help the world's poorest countries, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Saturday.

Yellen said the funding would make the United States the largest supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which provides zero-interest rate loans to support low-income countries as they work to stabilize their economies, boost growth and improve debt sustainability.

Congress approved the bill with a Senate vote after midnight, avoiding a government shutdown. The IMF spending will make good on a promise President Joe Biden made over two years ago with other leaders from the Group of 20 large economies to provide $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling with macroeconomic risks.

The PRGT is the IMF's main vehicle for providing zero-interest loans to low-income countries to support their economic programs and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the IMF says it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $30 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in poor countries from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

The IMF expects demand for PRGT lending to reach nearly $40 billion this year, more than four times the historical average.

""Today's development marks a key milestone in the United States meeting its commitment to provide support to low-income countries that are still bearing economic scarring from the pandemic, while responding to high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from Russia's war against Ukraine,"" Yellen said in a statement first reported by Reuters.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, said the long-delayed U.S. funding came ""just in nick of time, given exorbitant interest rates in poorer countries, especially in Africa,"" that have hit low-income countries hard, compounding already high debt burdens.

He noted that Congress had refused to approve Treasury's plans to loan some of the funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, set up to provide funding for countries to work on climate change and other challenges.

Yellen said the funding for the IMF reflected Washington's ongoing support for the institution and the unique role it plays in the international monetary system through its policy advice, capacity development and lending and focus on good governance, robust economic reforms and necessary adjustment.

""I look forward to continuing our partnership with the IMF to support the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen said.

A report by Qatar Development Bank and VC data company MAGNiTT released this week investigated venture investment trends in Qatar and the wider Middle East.

The MENA countries saw capital decline by 23% year-on-year (YoY) in total. In 2023, MENA deals dropped by 34% compared with the same period the previous year.

""As the overall economic conditions remain volatile, interest rates at their highest in more than two decades leading to higher borrowing expenses and creating competition for venture capital investments as safer assets yield greater returns, the overall sentiment across the VC ecosystem is likely impacted,"" Farah el Nahlawi, research team lead at MAGNiTT and author of the report, told Al-Monitor.

Qatar saw VC investments tumble by 57% to 43 million QR ($11.81 million), eclipsed only by Bahrain with an 82% drop. The UAE saw a 45% fall while Egypt saw 30% less VC funding in 2023.

""Overall, Gulf countries reported a YoY decline in funding of 14%. However, if we exclude the impact of Saudi Arabia (which saw a 33% YoY increase in funding and therefore skews the average), the Gulf countries reported a 47% YoY retreat in funding,"" Nahlawi said.

Asked whether VC investments in the region were likely to pick up in 2024, the expert said it depends on multiple factors. ""The region had seen in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 the announcement of several funds, highlighting the availability of dry powder in the market. But when exactly this will translate into investment in startups is still unclear,"" Nahlawi said.

Any interest rate cuts and return of international interest will likely speed up VC investment, he said.

Gulf countries like Qatar are investing in start-up ecosystems. The Gulf state announced a $1 billion ""Fund of Funds"" at the Web Summit in Doha last month, but Nahlawi said that ""only time will tell"" whether such investments will translate into an upward trend in VC investment this year. The Qatar Investment Authority's $1 billion deployment looks to help the country develop a vibrant VC and start-up market.

Between 2016 and 2023, 187 start-ups were founded in Qatar, and there have been 224 venture capital transactions in the country, according to the report.",al-monitor.com,news,Al-Monitor,,0.1058823529411765,448872283,1,https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2024-03/53554357200_2f4e944e4e_k.jpg?h=238fa094&itok=ukyebl8d,eng-9414894

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

There's more good news for Lechlade Community Library.

To help with the annual operating costs of the Library, the Gloucestershire County Councillor for Fairford and Lechlade-on-Thames, Dom Morris has announced that a one-off grant of £2,000 will be paid to the Library alongside the existing annual £10,000 at the start of this financial year and is to be used at the discretion of the Library volunteers to assist with any increased costs.

Cllr Morris said: ""The extra funding has come from a Conservative and Green budget amendment.

""The funding settlement for community libraries is set every four years and is due for review in 2025.

""Any permanent change to the annual grant will be made as part of this review process next year.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

China's cabinet on Tuesday unveiled new steps to arrest a slowdown in foreign investment, including expanding market access and relaxing some rules.

Overseas firms have turned sour on China since it enacted ultra-strict COVID curbs during the pandemic then suddenly abandoned them in late 2022, with concerns over the business environment, a shaky economic recovery and rising geopolitical tensions with the West weighing on confidence.

A series of prolonged regulatory crackdowns on sectors from technology to education have also rattled domestic and foreign investors, adding to unease over policy transparency in China.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last year that American businesses had told her that China was becoming ""uninvestible.""

In 2023, foreign direct investment into China shank 8% year-on-year.

Of the foreign investment in the first two months, 71.44 billion yuan, or a third of the total, went into China's high-tech industries, including high-tech manufacturing, the ministry said.

The legislation passed 74-24 shortly after 2 a.m. ET and capped off months of bipartisan dealmaking to fund the government through Sept. 30.

The bill unveiled Thursday funds the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, State, Education, and the legislative branch. It covers roughly 70% of the federal government and, with its passage, brings a close to the fiscal 2024 appropriations process, nearly six months after it began.

The upper chamber hit a stalemate Friday evening as Republicans demanded multiple amendment votes related to immigration and the border in exchange for speeding up the process. Cooperation from all 100 senators was required to come to an agreement in order to fast-track the massive spending package ahead of the Friday night deadline.

Government funding formally lapsed at midnight, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor about 15 minutes before the shutdown deadline to announce a deal had been reached on amendment votes and final passage.

The White House's Office of Management and Budget called off formal shutdown preparations shortly after midnight because ""there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday.""

Lawmakers have struggled to get over the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by a divided Congress that required several short-term, stopgap funding bills to keep agencies funded.

The bipartisan compromise legislation had been touted as a win by both Republican and Democratic leaders. However, the vote in the House on Friday angered many Republicans over the contents of the bill and how quickly it moved.

Groups in the county can apply for up to £8,300 from the Prime Foundation's annual fund.

The foundation was established to improve education, health, and social wellbeing at community levels.

Causes where Prime, a health and care property developer, has erected new facilities form the core targets for the funding.

The grants also serve to support initiatives close to the foundation's birthplace, Worcestershire.

In the previous year, three community initiatives, including STEPWAY, a charity dedicated to veterans and their families, have received funding.

Using the funds it was able to build a large shed on a pontoon with the aid of the acquired funding - offering safekeeping for machinery, as well as quieter office spaces.

Stepway's CEO, Dawn Turner, said: ""The funding received from the Prime Foundation has transformed and enhanced support services at the Stepway community garden.

""The office and workshop will benefit veterans, family members and the local community.""

Unfortunately, vandalism befell the shed last year, which consequently led to multiple acts of aid, including the foundation's financial aid for the installation of monitoring equipment to enhance site security.

The Worcester Child Contact Centre, another beneficiary of the fund, had its facilities upgraded.

The funding saw the development of a parent-child reading zone full of books, toys, furniture, games, and crafts.

Lastly, the Lido Park Tennis Club had an influx of equipment which sparked the start of a club for homeschooled children and teens in Droitwich Spa.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

Yellen stressed that this funding would position the United States as the principal supporter of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).

The PRGT offers zero-interest rate loans to assist low-income countries in stabilising their economies, fostering growth, and enhancing debt sustainability.

The bill's passage, secured with a Senate vote post-midnight, ensures the United States fulfils a commitment made by President Joe Biden and other leaders from the Group of 20 major economies over two years ago.

The commitment pledges $100 billion to support low-income and vulnerable countries grappling with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and facing macroeconomic challenges.

The PRGT serves as the IMF's primary mechanism for providing zero-interest loans to low-income nations, facilitating economic programs and catalysing additional financing from various sources, including donors, development institutions, and the private sector.

Throughout the pandemic, the IMF reports having provided over $30 billion in interest-free loans through the PRGT to more than 50 low-income countries, mitigating instability in regions ranging from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal.

With demand for PRGT lending expected to soar to nearly $40 billion this year, notably surpassing historical averages, Yellen hailed the development as a crucial step in fulfilling the United States' commitment to supporting low-income nations.

She underscored the urgency of addressing economic scars from the pandemic, high debt vulnerabilities, climate risks, and spillovers from ongoing global conflicts.

Kevin Gallagher, director of Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, highlighted the importance of the long-awaited US funding, particularly amidst soaring interest rates in poorer countries, particularly in Africa, exacerbating existing debt burdens.

However, Congress declined to authorise Treasury's proposals to allocate some funds to the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust, designed to aid countries in addressing climate change and other pressing challenges.

Yellen reaffirmed Washington's enduring support for the IMF, recognising its pivotal role in the international monetary system through policy guidance, capacity building, lending, and stress upon governance and economic reforms.

""I anticipate further collaboration with the IMF to address the needs of low-income countries,"" Yellen stated.

The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

The vote was 74-24. It came after funding had expired for the agencies at midnight, but the White House sent out a notice shortly after the deadline announcing the Office of Management and Budget had ceased shutdown preparations because there was a high degree of confidence that Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it on Saturday.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations,"" the White House statement said.

Prospects for a short-term government shutdown had appeared to grow Friday evening after Republicans and Democrats battled over proposed amendments to the bill. Any successful amendments to the bill would have sent the legislation back to the House, which had already left town for a two-week recess.

But shortly before midnight Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a breakthrough.

""It's been a very long and difficult day, but we have just reached an agreement to complete the job of funding the government,"" Schumer said. ""It is good for the country that we have reached this bipartisan deal. It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it.""

While Congress has already approved money for Veterans Affairs, Interior, Agriculture and other agencies, the bill approved this week is much larger, providing funding for the Defense, Homeland Security and State departments and other aspects of general government.

The House passed the bill Friday morning by a vote of 286-134, narrowly gaining the two-thirds majority needed for approval. More than 70% of the money would go to defense.

The vote tally in the House reflected anger among Republicans over the content of the package and the speed with which it was brought to a vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought the measure to the floor even though a majority of Republicans ended up voting against it. He said afterward that the bill ""represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.""

In sign of the conservative frustration, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., initiated an effort to oust Johnson as the House began the vote but held off on further action until the House returns in two weeks. It's the same tool that was used last year to remove the last Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy of California.

The vote breakdown showed 101 Republicans voting for the bill and 112 voting against it. Meanwhile, 185 Democrats voted for the bill and 22 against.

Rep. Kay Granger, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee that helped draft the package, stepped down from that role after the vote. She said she would stay on the committee to provide advice and lead as a teacher for colleagues when needed.

Johnson broke up this fiscal year's spending bills into two parts as House Republicans revolted against what has become an annual practice of asking them to vote for one massive, complex bill called an omnibus with little time to review it or face a shutdown. Johnson viewed that as a breakthrough, saying the two-part process was ""an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory.""

Still, the latest package was clearly unpopular with most Republicans, who viewed it as containing too few of their policy priorities and as spending too much.

""The bottom line is that this is a complete and utter surrender,"" said Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.

It took lawmakers six months into the current fiscal year to get near the finish line on government funding, the process slowed by conservatives who pushed for more policy mandates and steeper spending cuts than a Democratic-led Senate or White House would consider. The impasse required several short-term, stopgap spending bills to keep agencies funded.

The first package of full-year spending bills, which funded the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture and the Interior, among others, cleared Congress two weeks ago with just hours to spare before funding expired for those agencies.

When combining the two packages, discretionary spending for the budget year will come to about $1.66 trillion. That does not include programs such as Social Security and Medicare, or financing the country's rising debt.

To win over support from Republicans, Johnson touted some of the spending increases secured for about 8,000 more detention beds for migrants awaiting their immigration proceedings or removal from the country. That's about a 24% increase from current levels. Also, GOP leadership highlighted more money to hire about 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Democrats, meanwhile, are boasting of a $1 billion increase for Head Start programs and new child care centers for military families. They also played up a $120 million increase in funding for cancer research and a $100 million increase for Alzheimer's research.

""Make no mistake, we had to work under very difficult top-line numbers and fight off literally hundreds of extreme Republican poison pills from the House, not to mention some unthinkable cuts,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on that committee, appealed to her GOP colleagues by stating that the bill's spending on non-defense programs actually decreases even before accounting for inflation. She called the package ""conservative"" and ""carefully drafted.""

""These bills are not big spending bills that are wildly out of scope,"" Collins said.

The spending package largely tracks with an agreement that then-Speaker McCarthy worked out with the White House in May 2023, which restricted spending for two years and suspended the debt ceiling into January 2025 so the federal government could continue paying its bills.

Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers that last year's agreement, which became the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will save the federal government about $1 trillion over the coming decade.

In his regular daily press conference held at the port of Coatzacoalcos in the eastern state of Veracruz, the Mexican president described the measure of the Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) as ""a good decision,"" which will benefit the economy in general.

The central bank announced on Thursday the decision to lower the key interest rate to 11 percent, the first cut in three years, as the board ""acknowledged the disinflationary process under way since the last time the reference rate was adjusted.""

""It helps people, businessmen invest, and it helps all of us Mexicans,"" the president said.

Lopez Obrador added that in terms of public finances, lowering the cost of credit would help lower the variable interest rate on government debt, as 70 percent of the total amount is recorded in pesos rather than in other currencies.

The president stressed that the Mexican currency was not immediately affected by Banxico's measures.

Senators missed a midnight deadline to pass the $1.2 trillion package keeping the lights on in several key government agencies -- but Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said a series of votes expected soon would halt any action on winding up government operations.

""It wasn't easy, but tonight our persistence has been worth it... It is good for the American people that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to finish the job,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor after hours of tense negotiation that spilled into Saturday morning.

A day of high-stakes drama began on Capitol Hill when the House of Representatives passed a $1.2 trillion, six-bill package Friday lunchtime representing the largest and most contentious section of federal funding.

With cash running out at midnight for three-quarters of the government, including defense and homeland security, the Senate was thrust into a race against the clock to advance the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk.

But the budget negotiations looked like breaking down, with both sides pushing to tweak the legislation to reflect their campaign messaging and priorities ahead of November's presidential election, when Biden faces Trump.

Senators were preparing to adjourn with no deal on holding a vote, which would have prompted the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin scaling back operations in key federal agencies on Saturday morning.

But a deal came together just as the midnight deadline arrived and the Senate is now expected to sweep procedural hurdles out of the way to approve the package in the coming hours.

- Shutdown preparations 'ceased' -

""OMB has ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the president will sign the bill on Saturday,"" the White House said in a statement.

""Because obligations of federal funds are incurred and tracked on a daily basis, agencies will not shut down and may continue their normal operations.""

Hours earlier Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had angered his own right flank by relying on Democratic votes to advance the package to the Senate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close ally of Trump, told reporters she had filed a ""motion to vacate"" the speaker's chair over Johnson's endorsement of the funding package, thrashed out over weeks of tense negotiations between the parties.

The resolution, a rare maneuver that requires a simple majority to pass, comes after the same move led to the removal of previous speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall -- and weeks of infighting as Republicans rejected several potential replacements before settling on Johnson.

The timeline for next steps on Greene's resolution was not immediately clear, although a vote to remove Johnson couldn't take place until April at the earliest, with the House now on a two-week recess.

Greene told CNN ""quite a few"" Republicans were supporting her effort.

Senate leaders were seeking an agreement on a sped-up timeline to green-light the legislation, which has already been delayed by six months of haggling in a Congress divided almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats.

But the upper chamber insists on arcane procedural rules that can delay votes by days and can only be sidestepped if all 100 members agree.

The shutdown would have affected about 70 percent of government agencies and departments, as the first 30 percent -- covering agriculture, science, veterans' programs, transport and housing -- passed without major drama last month.

Five of the six bills covering the rest of federal spending were also straightforward, but disputes over the funding of homeland security delayed the release of the deal, originally expected last weekend.

Republican hard-liners were angered by a lack of stricter border security provisions in the package, as well as the overall price tag and the elevated speed with which the deal has been negotiated.
