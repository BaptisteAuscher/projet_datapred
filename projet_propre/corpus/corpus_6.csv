Emin Gün Sirer, the visionary co-founder of the Avalanche blockchain, has issued a stark warning about emerging deceptive trends within certain layer-2 (L2) solutions, which he believes are jeopardizing the integrity of the cryptocurrency markets. In a detailed exposition on X, Sirer elucidates the perils these ""trash"" projects present, alongside educating his audience on identifying their common pitfalls and red flags.

The crypto pioneer has expressed his dismay at the surge of substandard L2 projects, branding them as the next major threat to the crypto ecosystem in the wake of the notorious heist led by Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX founder and CEO. According to Sirer, the lax launch protocols for L2 solutions provide a fertile ground for unscrupulous entities to spawn projects devoid of any real value, thus endangering investor security.

Sirer points out several indicators of potential risk within these L2 solutions. A primary concern is the misalignment between the projects' narratives and their technological underpinnings, where grandiose marketing claims fail to match up with the actual technical delivery. This discrepancy often manifests in projects that rely on centralized sequencers without robust fraud-proof mechanisms, starkly contradicting the foundational cryptocurrency principles of decentralization and security.

Further, Sirer warns against L2 solutions that initiate token sales with the sole intent of fundraising, lacking any tangible application within the network. Such practices hint at potential investment traps. Alarmingly, instances where project founders offload their native tokens prior to a project's launch emerge as a significant red flag.

Adding to the list of concerns, Sirer sheds light on the issue of low-float tokens within L2 projects, which can lead to token value inflation through manipulative practices reminiscent of those employed by Sam Bankman-Fried. He also urges investors to scrutinize the moral fiber of project founders, suggesting that personal misconduct should weigh heavily in any investment decision.

In a bid to assist investors in navigating the crowded L2 landscape, Sirer proposes a straightforward test to discern genuine and profitable ventures. He encourages investors to focus on the prevailing ""blockers"" in the crypto space, such as scalability and performance, which were once major issues until resolved by blockchains like Avalanche and Solana. According to Sirer, the current challenges lie in supporting multiple use cases on a single platform and bridging the gap with traditional finance.

Despite the risks outlined by Sirer, the Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystem has witnessed remarkable growth, with its total value locked (TVL) surpassing $27 billion. Notably, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now commands a 49.17% market share among L2 networks, significantly outpacing its closest competitor, Optimism Mainnet. This expansion underscores the critical role of discernment and due diligence for investors navigating the complex and evolving crypto landscape.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,-0.04313725490196074,448989232,1,https://btc-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/png-27.png,eng-9421693

BBC NI presenters' long-term contracts are among those the broadcaster is threatening to cut unless they agree to cover the cost of a multi-million pound tax settlement, according to reports.

It is understood ultimatums have been issued to freelance presenters in the latest twist in a seven year row about employment status.

The presenters have been told they owe thousands of pounds to the BBC, which settled a tax case on their behalf.

However, according to the Sunday Times, the presenters argue that the BBC had no right to pay the money and they were never made aware that the debt was being paid.

The have received legal advice that the broadcaster may have acted unlawfully, the report said.

The dispute relates to the employment status of presenters who were not full-time staff but instead had freelance contracts.

The arrangement was mutually beneficial as it enabled the freelance presenters to pay less tax and the BBC to save on national insurance contributions and paying other employee-related benefits.

To comply with a new law introduced in 2003, the BBC introduced a general policy of hiring freelancers on contracts longer than six months or worth more than £10,000 only if the individual had a personal services company.

Several presenters, including Samira Ahmed, who hosted Newswatch, claimed they were forced to set up PSCs. However, HM Revenue & Customs became concerned that many self-employed workers using the companies were disguised employees and put pressure on the BBC over its employment arrangements.

A BBC statement said: ""We have followed HMRC guidance throughout this process to ensure we meet our legal obligations alongside providing support for affected presenters.""",irishnews.com,news,The Irish News,,-0.0117647058823529,448989006,1,https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/EOGO66PCUZP47OY7VNIU6IE5MI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2c73adc923df3f6bad7c5db38b55d0d778744fd994ba5057479e2abd64ee5f26&width=1200&height=630,

One of the positions of need is wide receiver after trading Diontae Johnson away in the first week of free agency. There are a few WRs they have brought in for pre-draft visits and several top names that they held formal meetings with at the combine. Among those is Florida WR Ricky Pearsall Jr.

He reportedly came in for a pre-draft visit the week of March 18th. Teams only get 30 pre-draft visits, excluding local prospects, so any name that pops up on our pre-draft visit tracker should turn some heads. Last year, four names from the list ended up getting drafted and one more was signed later in the season. They didn't have a heavy presence at Florida's pro day, but Pearsall proved much of what he needed to at the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine, and he chose to not workout at the pro day as a result.

I got to speak with Pearsall in a media session at the combine and learn more about him as a prospect. He was asked what kinds of things he is still working on to improve his game.

""I work on all kinds of things. I think I've gotten better at using my hands,"" Pearsall said. ""Obviously I trust myself with my game strength, but being able to find things that you need to work on I think is really important moving forward.""

""Going out there and failing a bunch of times throughout my career, learning from my failures,"" he said. ""You can't let a failure go to waste. I truly believe that. So, just working on my craft each and every day, whatever that means. Hitting on all cylinders of that.""

Being a student of the game and constantly working to improve is one of the things that sets great NFL players from good ones. Pearsall certainly showed that improvement over his college career, increasing his production over his last three seasons and ending with 1,027 total yards and six touchdowns on 65 receptions in his final year at Florida.

He also showed improvements in his blocking abilities over that time. For a full breakdown with clips of his college tape, check out my scouting report on him. He is a very willing blocker, and that is more than half the battle at the wide receiver position. He has a competitive edge to him and gives his all in every phase of the game. His blocking abilities are still a work in progress, but he fits into the blocks well. The issues come when he needs to sustain a block. He was asked about that willingness to throw his body around for his teammates.

""Just being selfless, those guys in the locker room, developing relationships with them each and every day,"" Pearsall said. ""I think that helps motivate me to block harder out there for them. They do it for me, I gotta do it right back.""

The Steelers figure to run the ball a lot in 2024 with the two-headed backfield of Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren and Arthur Smith's offensive system works well with receivers who are willing to make a block out on the perimeter. That can be the difference between a five-yard gain and a 20-yard gain sometimes.

Speaking of the Steelers, he was asked about meeting with the team. He did not have a formal meeting with them at the combine, but he did have some informal conversations, and he definitely talked to them at the Senior Bowl.

""It was kind of crazy, 'cause I got done with my meeting at the Senior Bowl and I turned around and he's like, 'Ricky,' and I turned around and I saw him and I was like, 'oh what's up coach,'"" Pearsall said of taking a minute to realize that he was speaking with Mike Tomlin. ""It was an honor to meet him, but yeah he's a really good dude, too.""

He had one incredible catch in college last season that went viral in sports circles on social media. It was a one-handed grab up the middle of the field, and he secured it even though he received a big hit from the safety immediately after. Here it is, posted by Field Yates on X.

He was asked about the aftermath of making such an incredible play.

""It got to the point where I had to put my phone on do not disturb for a little bit, 'cause obviously that brought some attention,"" he said. ""I think the most important people were in my family and my foundation, my friends, I appreciate them reaching out to me.""

He played a lot of snaps in the slot at Florida. Smith's offensive system in Pittsburgh, if it follows his history of usage elsewhere, might not get a ton of useage from a slot receiver. Pearsall was asked if he is comfortable lining up outside.

""I'm a receiver. I know how to get open,"" Pearsall said. ""Whatever that means, I think it means I can play both.""

One of the big questions I had in watching his tape was his high-end athleticism to be able to turn short gains into big ones, or stretch the defense vertically down the field. He more than proved that at the combine with one of the best all around performances at the position.

Some items like fines and penalties create differences of a permanent nature, which have an impact on one tax period while others, like the pattern of allocation of assets, generate differences of a temporary nature, which have an impact in multiple tax periods. Only temporary differences lead to deferred tax, which is the tax that will be settled in the future tax period.

The International Accounting Standard 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12) deals with deferred tax. The UAE has already adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); and the para 47 of the IAS 12 states ""Deferred tax assets and liabilities shall be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period"".

Cabinet Decision No. 116 of 2022 that was issued on 30 December 2022 (effective Feb 1, 2023) and enforced within 15 days from its publication (January 16, 2023), requires that a standard rate of nine per cent will apply to taxable income exceeding a threshold of Dh375,000, and a rate of zero per cent will apply to taxable income not exceeding that threshold. Following the issuance of the cabinet decision that provides the rate and tax threshold, the tax law is deemed ""enacted"" as of January 16, 2023. Consequently, companies are required to evaluate the implications of deferred tax and calculate the estimated deferred tax for reporting periods ending on or after January 16, 2023 onwards.

The computation of deferred tax is contingent upon the basis -- accrual or realisation -- adopted by the company for tax purposes. If the company uses the accrual basis for tax purposes and the financial statements are already prepared on an accrual basis, then there will generally be no variance between the carrying amount and tax base for most items, provided that the balances in the balance sheet reflect the fair market value. If the balances in the balance sheet are not carried at the fair market value as mandated by tax law to be carried forward at an arm's length price (transitional provisions of the law), deferred tax will arise unless the difference is permanent in nature.

For instance, if the fair market value of a carried forward building is Dh20 million and is reported in the balance sheet at the same value, there will be no temporary difference, thus no deferred tax implications. Permanent differences such as exempt income, and non-allowable expenses (e.g., fines, penalties, 50 per cent entertainment expenses, bribes, illicit payment, nonbusiness expenses, and expenses related to exempt income) will not result in deferred tax as they are permanent in nature.

Keeping in view the adjustments as outlined in Article 20(2) of the law, required to convert the accounting profits into taxable profits, it is evident that some items like depreciation, amortisation, provisions, etc., as presented in the financial statements, are allowable for tax purposes, unless stipulated otherwise by the Minister under Article 20(2)(i) of the law.

When a taxable person adopts the realisation basis for tax purposes after preparing their financial statements on accrual basis, the carrying values of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements will differ from the tax base. The figures in the financial statements are displayed on an accrual basis, while for taxation purposes on the realization basis/cash basis. These temporary differences lead to deferred tax unless they are of a permanent nature as described earlier.

For instance, if the written down value of a plant and machinery in the financial statements is Dh20 million (cost of Dh25 million less accumulated depreciation of Dh5 million), and the same is carrying amount for tax purposes, whereas the tax base is Dh25 million on realisation principles. This difference in the carrying amount and tax base creates a deductible temporary difference of Dh5 million, that will lead to deferred tax asset.

In a nutshell, when accrual basis is used with balances reflecting at fair market value in financial statements, temporary differences are generally not generated for most items. However, 16, necessitating thorough analysis.

Don't Waste Your Money on a Sporty AWD Model | Gear Patrol,"Generally speaking, electric vehicles come in two flavors: single-motor and dual-motor.

Dual-motor EVs are more popular. They feature all-wheel-drive and come with more power, more torque and often some straight-line speed numbers that are seriously spellbinding.

By comparison, the less potent single-motor variations can seem downright pedestrian, but don't be fooled. They may be the better overall option for most people. Here is why.

No matter how fast you'd like to go (or how fast the manufacturer says you can go), there's only so much power you can deploy safely (and legally) on public roads. How much difference will that extra 34 horsepower from the Polestar 2 Performance Pack bumping it to 455 hp make? Most owners will never discover that in everyday driving.

The single-motor EV may have all the torque most drivers will ever use. And with immediate torque delivery from the electric powertrain, it will feel pretty quick.

This is typically structured as long-term support through standing contributions and donations that are built into your estate. And to make philanthropy most successful, it's important to incorporate it into your overall financial planning. That will help ensure that both you and the beneficiary get the maximum value from your giving. If you want to make philanthropy part of your financial plan, you may consider working a financial advisor. Here are a few things to think about.

The basic definition of philanthropy is charitable giving. Any donation to an altruistic or selfless cause is philanthropic. However, from a financial planning standpoint, it's helpful to think of philanthropy as the structural side of giving. If charity is an individual donation, philanthropy is a practice and plan for ongoing donations.

Practicing effective philanthropy can be complicated. Mechanically, the steps needed to give money to charity are straightforward. Every organization will have a different process for taking funds, but it is typically as easy as sending a check or submitting a payment through their website.

It's everything around giving that can be a challenge. Ideally, a philanthropic relationship is long-term. You want to help support an organization for years to come. Generally, the best place to start, is by looking at the charity's plan: What will they do with this money? What is their plan for growth? How are they using their donations for immediate giving and long-term development?

With philanthropy, it's easy to simply give as you think of it. You might like to support your university or a specific organization. So you give when they come around to ask for donations. This approach isn't bad, but it's far less effective than it could be. Instead, work this giving into your overall financial plan. Budget for regular donations, and plan for that giving ahead of time.

Taking a premeditated approach will also help considerably with your personal finances, including liquidity and wealth management. For example, by planning for giving ahead of time, you can keep your money invested until its needed and then ensure that it's liquid in time for your donation.

A financial plan will also maximize the value of your giving. Organizations can do far more with structural philanthropy than they can with ad hoc charity. Planning around future cash flow empowers organizations to invest, build and hire, and improve how they fulfill their mission overall.

This is an area where you may want to work with a chartered advisor in philanthropy (CAP). Ideally, a plan for giving will encompass years of financial management. For the right organization, you may want to think about this like setting aside a college fund or building a retirement. You want to work with your advisor to create a long-term plan that will let you build wealth around ongoing contributions, so that both you and the organization can know what to expect in years to come.

While the best tax deduction rarely leaves you wealthier than saving the money, a tax deduction does make giving less expensive. So you should not leave that money on the table.

If you're retired, make sure to look at qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs. This is a process by which your donations count toward your retirement portfolio's required minimum distribution, allowing a tax-free RMD. And this can save wealthier households significantly on their portfolio taxes.

Beyond that, plan your charitable contributions around your maximum tax benefits each year. For example, if a little extra giving could push you down into a lower tax bracket, it may be worth boosting your donation. Or look into donor-advised funds, which allow you to make a large, tax deductible donation into a fund that can then distribute its assets over time.

If you're liquidating assets to make your donation, prioritize those that would trigger higher capital gains taxes (for example those with the lowest cost basis).

To claim charitable tax deductions you must line-item your taxes, so most of this planning isn't valuable for anyone who takes the standard deduction. However, for households who file a Schedule A, making the most of your taxes can vastly reduce the effective costs of philanthropy.

Your immediate instinct may be to give cash, and that describes most philanthropic or charitable donations. But many organizations, particularly large or sophisticated ones, operate their own portfolios as well.

For these groups, appreciable assets are often one of the most valuable forms of giving. A donation of securities or other investment products can allow the group to build its wealth over time, funding operations far into the future.

Increasingly, one of the most common requests from large and established organizations has to do with a donor's will. This is because estate planning can be one of the most valuable ways to give to charity. You can use your estate to pass down not only cash and portfolio assets but also real estate or other forms of property. Some donors, depending on the needs of their family, can even name an organization as the beneficiary under their life insurance policy.

Depending on your situation, estate planning can often be a good way to make a high-value donation to a worthy cause. As with building a long-term plan, speak with your financial advisor about this, because when it comes to funding causes that you care about, estate planning can be the single best thing you can do.

Philanthropic giving is an excellent way to support causes and institutions that you care about. It's important to establish your philanthropy with a financial advisor, because long-term planning will maximize the value of your donations both to yourself and the recipient.

Terms are chosen carefully. Legal ""loopholes"" or ""dodges"" are to blame, not illegal ""shelters"" or ""evasion."" These semantic decisions suggest that political will, or the lack thereof, stands in the way of ensuring major earners and corporate interests pay their fair share.

That isn't to say there aren't occasional tax arrangements that venture into illegal tax evasion territory. But in the main, the cause of many of these zero-tax fiscal years isn't illegality, but perfectly legal leveraging of disparate elements of tax policy.

The policy architecture of our US and internationals tax systems -- with myriad deductions, credits, incentives, and room for manipulation -- provides a fertile ground for legal tax avoidance that sounds like tax evasion when expressed in simple terms to the general public.

Outrage sparked by stories of corporations legally using the tax system to minimize their liabilities is misdirected if it solely vilifies the companies for acting within the confines of established tax policy. Demand for policy reform should match such backlash.

The real path to change lies in electing officials who have the political will to overhaul the underlying policies -- not in expecting corporations to pay more taxes than they are legally required to.

Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) increased the standard deduction, lowered the corporate and estate tax rates and increased the child tax credit, among other things.

While some people may be affected more than others, a number of tax breaks are set to expire at the end of December 2025 and revert to pre-TCJA rules.

""As crazy as it may sound, December 31, 2025, will be here soon,"" tax attorney Adam Brewer, with AB Tax Law, told Nexstar. ""If Congress doesn't take action to extend the cuts or pass new tax cuts, then the average American can expect to see their tax bill increase slightly in tax year 2026.""

Some residents of high-tax states like California, New York and Massachusetts could actually benefit thanks to the scheduled expiration of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, Brewer said.

SALT allowed taxpayers to deduct certain taxes paid to state and local governments - including property taxes and either state income or sales taxes, but not both - on their federal income tax returns.

""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) significantly increased federal standard deduction amounts (thereby reducing the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions) and capped the total SALT deduction at $10,000,"" according to the Tax Policy Center. ""As a result, the share of filers claiming the SALT deduction fell to 9 percent, with the estimated revenue costs dropping to $13.5 billion in 2020.""

The standard deduction will be roughly half of what is now, adjusted for inflation, if the TCJA expires.

Deductions eliminated by the TCJA include the mortgage interest deduction and most miscellaneous deductions, such as investment/ advisory fees, legal fees, and unreimbursed employee expenses.

""These will once again be allowed, starting Jan. 1, 2026, under the previous rules, to the extent they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income,"" according to Joshua Youngblood, senior tax adviser with the Youngblood Group.

If Congress fails to pass a tax bill in time, one of the changes that will affect the average American is the expiration of the TCJA's lower tax rates.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the tax rate for nearly all income brackets.

""Those married filing a joint return in a 12% tax bracket ($22,001 to $89,450) will increase to 15%,"" Youngblood said, citing one example. ""Those in a 22% tax rate ($89,451 to $180,000) will increase to 25% from 22%.""

Families will also see the child tax credit, which was doubled to $2,000 under the TCJA, revert to $1,000 per child.

One of the major changes that will affect many small businesses and the self-employed is the elimination of the qualified business income (QBI) deduction.

The QBI ""is a deduction of up to 20% for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations,"" according to Youngblood. ""This also includes sole proprietorships.""

Self-employed people who might qualify for the deduction include gig economy workers, artists, Etsy sellers, contractors, restaurateurs, freelancers and various small business owners, according to tax services company Jackson Hewitt.

One business-related TCJA change that won't expire at the end of 2025 is the flat 21% corporate tax rate. Before the 2017 tax code change the top rate was 35%, according to Youngblood.

Despite the broad changes to the tax code, Brewer says he's not recommending that his clients put a lot of energy into planning just yet.

""When we have the results of the presidential election, hopefully in November or December of this year, then a clearer picture of future tax rates may begin emerge,"" Brewer told Nexstar.

If the TCJA tax bill appears likely to expire, both Brewer and Youngblood say some taxpayers may want to realize any sizable investment gains before the tax rates increase.

""Given the complete dysfunction in Congress,"" Youngblood said. ""I think it is wise to at least look at some planning in the event there are no changes.""

Along with taking a look at any rapidly growing investments, Youngblood also recommends that business owners work with a tax adviser to review the structure of their businesses.

""Often, people think a C Corporation is only for large businesses, and that is not true,"" Youngblood said. ""It can make sense for a small business.""

Another planning opportunity, he said, is to create a plan to maximize QBI deductions before the deduction expires.",wkbn.com,news,WKBN,,0.1137254901960785,448985903,1,https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/03/GettyImages-1441371670-2.jpg?strip=1&w=640,

She knew the time of her death in advance, ­having ­arranged to go to the ­Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. She knew too she had options - options that many people who don't have the considerable sums of money needed to ­follow her example do not.

Paola had terminal bowel cancer. She wasn't afraid of death, she said in a short film she made before travelling. She was afraid of dying in pain. She had already ­undergone ""brutal surgery"".

I had a friend who chose the same route.

She told me that had she understood how profoundly painful and distressing such major surgery would be, she wouldn't have gone ahead with it. As it was, it only allowed her a number of painful months ­before she, too, died.

As it happens, the latest attempt to bring an assisted dying bill before the Scottish Parliament should be formally introduced by LibDem MSP Liam McArthur before Holyrood goes into its Easter recess at the end of this week.

The late Margo MacDonald, who had Parkinson's disease, tried in vain to ­introduce assisted dying in 2010. The cause was picked up by Patrick Harvie in 2013. He was also unsuccessful.

Margo left us 10 years ago but remains one of the few politicians for whom a Christian name suffices for identification.

There are good reasons to suppose that McArthur's bill has a rather better chance of passing into law. For one thing, the medical profession's trade bodies mainly pronounce themselves neutral when once they were hostile.

The public too is supportive. During the three-month consultation process, more than three-quarters of the respondents were ­supportive of the bill.

Many of those opposed cited religious reasons, arguing that only their god should determine when we die. I'm not a ­believer, but I find it difficult to suppose a loving god would argue in favour of bad, painful death.

The Right To Life organisation mounted a campaign to oppose the bill. They might have been more successful had they not sent all the same similarly worded ­sentiments from the one email address.

It meant that these particular ­respondents could not be assumed to be individuals with a discrete opinion on the matter, rather an orchestrated response ­involving a circulated template.

I think it perfectly fair and ­reasonable that health professionals with a ­conscientious objection to assisted ­dying should not have to be part of the process in the same way as anti-abortionists' ­convictions should be respected.

Ditto parliamentarians in any of the UK parliaments.

What does not seem either fair or ­reasonable is that the views of less than a quarter of the public should be superimposed on the rest of the citizenry.

The responses to the consultation ­exercise often contained heart-rending tales of those who had to stand aside whilst those they loved died in pain and distress. I can relate to that. One of the last things my late mother said to me was, ""Nobody should have to suffer pain like this"". It haunts me to this day.

In the event, she died in hospital, thanks - I concluded - to what is known as ""­double effect"" palliative sedation. In plain ­English, given enough pain relief to hasten death.

Most people would like to fall off their perch suddenly and in their own bed. Most people don't. Invariably, they will contract some illness for which the ­treatment can involve unwanted side effects.

Usually, they spend their final hours in the embrace of the health service.

People opposed to allowing folk to ""take back control"" of their lives and their death cite many reasons - none of which seem to have happened in those many ­jurisdictions which now allow their citizens to determine the time and the method of dying.

None of these countries or states seem to have experienced an upsurge in the numbers taking advantage of the law in question. What seems to be the case is that those who have life-limiting ailments can have the comfort of knowing there is a legal backstop which they can utilise should their situation worsen.

That legal security blanket allows them to face the future without the gnawing fear of having to cope with what might become unbearable pain.

And that can and does happen, despite the very best efforts of those charged with dispensing palliative care to terminally ill patients. Sometimes the medicine isn't up to the task at hand. Sometimes the ­patient is beyond taking it.

Other opponents worry that some ­people might try to hasten their own ­demise rather than become a burden on their family or the health service. That particular concern is purely ­hypothetical and, again, does not seem to have any statistical basis where assisted dying is ­already available.

The disabled community has its own set of fears, worrying that they might be valued less by a society which practices assisted dying. They have high-profile champions like Olympic medallist Tanni Grey-Thompson - though I venture to ­suggest that particular baroness may have faced different challenges from those she now represents in this debate.

We certainly need, as a society, to give our disabled citizens a much better deal - and not least those who save the Government many billions by caring for them.

Curiously, whilst many respondents quite rightly want to see robust safeguards attached to any legislation, others worry that a diagnosis of terminal illness likely to result in death in a matter of months doesn't include those whose lives have become nigh-intolerable as a result of progressive disease.

Going down that road would be much more problematical, I'm guessing - not least as the imperative of keeping on ­living ­often seems to outweigh what ­others would regard as a loss of those qualities which make life desirable.

Was it the campaign to help other MND victims which kept the late ­Doddie Weir going long after he was ­incapable of ""­normal"" life? Or, more probably ­perhaps, was it down to the character and ­personality of the person concerned?

Art doesn't always imitate life, but sometimes it is a useful way of illustrating it. Many thousands of people who didn't read Andrew O'Hagan's masterful Mayflies were introduced to the assisted dying debate by the television mini-series based on it.

It concerned two lifelong friends, one of whom decided to take the same route as Paola Marra. And when Tully decides to take that final step, he challenges his pal ""Noodles"" to both accept the decision and celebrate it.

Both the book and the TV adaptation are tear-jerkers, but much leavened by a rich vein of humour and liberal use of the Scottish demotic.

Paola said that the most difficult part of the last few bureaucratic months, as she dealt with the paperwork necessary to progress her Swiss trip, was having to say farewell to her many friends.

Canadian by birth, she had lived for 35 years in the UK, so there would be no shortage of them.

In fact, she said, there were many people, she couldn't meet because of an increasingly packed diary. People will say she was brave. And she undoubtedly was.

But, just as importantly, she was ­pragmatic. She used what she knew would be a limited time to make sure her beloved dog had a new home, and her ­beloved friends felt valued.

The pity of it is that the one thing over which she had no control was being able to stay in her adopted home since it would have been illegal in the UK to arrange to end her life at a time of her choosing.

Hopefully Liam McArthur's bill will change that, as might similar legislation being proposed for the Commons. The Scottish Parliament likes to think itself progressive.

Among the speakers was K.R. Satyanarayana, President of the Hoysala Sangha, who expressed concern over the underutilisation of Mysore Airport. He highlighted that the Airport, once bustling, now operates only a handful of flights, rendering it almost redundant.

With just two flights currently in operation, Satyanarayana urged Yaduveer, if elected, to promptly address this issue and revitalise Mysuru's presence on the global air travel map, thus facilitating both domestic and international travel.

Another attendee advocated for improved & faster ambulance services in Mysuru, while others voiced concerns over inadequate waste disposal management & persistent issue of black magic practitioners in the city.

They called upon law enforcement agencies to take decisive action to protect residents from the fear and harm associated with black magic practices. Additionally, some audience members raised alarm over the reckless burning of dried leaves and trees, which poses hazards to nearby residents.

Waste segregation and disposal

Addressing the public's complaints and grievances, Yaduveer acknowledged the ongoing efforts by launching special drives and conducting awareness campaigns to educate people about proper waste segregation and disposal.

He emphasised the importance of changing the public mindset towards waste disposal and urged for total cooperation in waste management, including supporting Pourakarmikas in their tasks.

Presenting his vision for the city, Yaduveer proposed a weekend initiative focused on the rejuvenation or conservation of a lake or a monument. He expressed willingness to extend this initiative to more days if there is sufficient public support.

Highlighting the contributions of his forefathers, the erstwhile rulers of Mysuru, Yaduveer drew parallels between their works and Prime Minister Modi's developmental programmes and schemes. He noted Modi's vision for India in 2047, the centenary of independence, and called for public support in realising this vision for a robust India.

In his address, former MLA Ramdas set a target of winning at least 370 seats in the LS polls and urged people to elect Yaduveer with a significant margin to enable him to serve effectively.

Wadiyars' rule and Modi's rule

Radha Mohandas Agarwal, the State BJP in-charge of the election campaign, underscored the revered administration of the erstwhile Mysuru rulers, which was widely lauded across the country during the pre-independence era.

Highlighting the Mysuru Maharajas' commitment to education, healthcare and other public welfare measures for the betterment of people's lives, Aggarwal emphasised Yaduveer's candidacy as a means to carry forward PM Modi's vision of a fully developed India. He urged the electorate to vote for Yaduveer with such a significant margin that it became a matter of national recognition for Mysuru.

Yaduveer was honoured at the event, which was attended by dignitaries including Vijaya Vittala Educational Institutions Hon. Secretary R. Vasudev Bhat, Mysuru (Rural) District BJP President L.R. Mahadevaswamy, City BJP President L. Nagendra, State BJP General Secretary M. Rajendra, former MLA N. Mahesh and others.

Visit to Pinjrapole

In the morning, Yaduveer paid a visit to the Mysore Pinjrapole Society situated at the foot of Chamundi Hill, where he performed 'Gau Puja,' expressing reverence for the sacred cow. He then proceeded to feed the cattle with offerings such as jaggery and sugarcane.

To mark his birthday today, Yaduveer was felicitated by Pinjrapole Society with a 'Tulabhara' ceremony, where he was weighed against bundles of jaggery.

""These will once again be allowed, starting Jan. 1, 2026, under the previous rules, to the extent they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income,"" according to Joshua Youngblood, senior tax adviser with the Youngblood Group.

If Congress fails to pass a tax bill in time, one of the changes that will affect the average American is the expiration of the TCJA's lower tax rates.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the tax rate for nearly all income brackets.

""Those married filing a joint return in a 12% tax bracket ($22,001 to $89,450) will increase to 15%,"" Youngblood said, citing one example. ""Those in a 22% tax rate ($89,451 to $180,000) will increase to 25% from 22%.""

Families will also see the child tax credit, which was doubled to $2,000 under the TCJA, revert to $1,000 per child.

One of the major changes that will affect many small businesses and the self-employed is the elimination of the qualified business income (QBI) deduction.

The QBI ""is a deduction of up to 20% for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations,"" according to Youngblood. ""This also includes sole proprietorships.""

Self-employed people who might qualify for the deduction include gig economy workers, artists, Etsy sellers, contractors, restaurateurs, freelancers and various small business owners, according to tax services company Jackson Hewitt.

One business-related TCJA change that won't expire at the end of 2025 is the flat 21% corporate tax rate. Before the 2017 tax code change the top rate was 35%, according to Youngblood.

Despite the broad changes to the tax code, Brewer says he's not recommending that his clients put a lot of energy into planning just yet.

""When we have the results of the presidential election, hopefully in November or December of this year, then a clearer picture of future tax rates may begin emerge,"" Brewer told Nexstar.

If the TCJA tax bill appears likely to expire, both Brewer and Youngblood say some taxpayers may want to realize any sizable investment gains before the tax rates increase.

""Given the complete dysfunction in Congress,"" Youngblood said. ""I think it is wise to at least look at some planning in the event there are no changes.""

Along with taking a look at any rapidly growing investments, Youngblood also recommends that business owners work with a tax adviser to review the structure of their businesses.

""Often, people think a C Corporation is only for large businesses, and that is not true,"" Youngblood said. ""It can make sense for a small business.""

Donate today

A new rule that will drastically limit emissions from New York City's coal and wood-fired stoves goes into effect next month, and one councilmember hopes to ease the burden it imposes on pizzerias.

The rule requires restaurants with coal or wood-fired stoves to add a filter system that will reduce their emissions by 75%. It applies to just over 100 eateries across the city, many of which are pizzerias. The filters cost around $20,000. In response, Councilmember Justin Brannan said he'll introduce legislation to give those restaurateurs a tax credit to install the filters.

""If the goal here is truly to reduce the emissions produced by these old school ovens and not to raise revenue by issuing more fines to our beloved small businesses, then let's help these pizzerias comply instead of setting them up to fail,"" Brannan said in a statement. ""Since only a handful of businesses will be impacted by the new rule, I'm confident we can come up with a solution so nobody gets burned.""

A tax credit would also require legislation in Albany.

The pollution is significant even when compared to natural gas, which is more commonly used in commercial kitchens. Burning wood produces two-and-a-half times more carbon emissions than gas, while coal produces about double the emissions of natural gas.

Wood-fired pizzeria owners who spoke to Gothamist were not thrilled with the cost of the filters, but acknowledged their pies cause pollution.

Mathieu Palombino, the owner of Motorino, said he burns a cord of wood every week at just one of his three locations. A cord is equal to roughly 5,000 pounds of wood, and can produce nearly 13,000 pounds of carbon dioxide when burned.

""We're throwing a forest inside these ovens, literally,"" Palombino said.

Palombino said he is considering switching to natural gas stoves at two other locations, and added that the cost of switching to gas is about the same as installing the new filters. He said he didn't taste any difference between gas- and wood-fired pizzas.

""There's the poetry of being wood-fired, but it really doesn't make a difference,"" Palombino said.

Research shows that commercial kitchens are a significant source of pollution in New York City. The city's NYC Community Air Survey found particulate matter, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and black carbon are at elevated levels in areas around the five boroughs with high concentrations of restaurants.

Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, said restaurants are the fastest-growing source of fine particulate matter in the city.

""We know that these [restaurants] are emitting a lot and contributing to the city's pollution,"" she said.

New York City pizza historian Scott Wiener said the filter system's cost makes it very unpopular among pizzerias.

""It definitely will be a burden for pizzerias,"" said Wiener, who runs Scott's Pizza Tours.

Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, agreed.

""The city should provide financial support to assist them with compliance or to find out if they are eligible for a variance,"" Rigie said.

Coal and wood-fired pizza restaurant owners have a little more time to buy the filters.

Although the law goes into effect on April 27, the Department of Environmental Protection said it won't begin issuing fines until 2025.

""All New Yorkers deserve to breathe healthy air, and wood- and coal-fired stoves are among the largest contributors of harmful pollutants in neighborhoods with poor air quality,"" wrote DEP spokesperson Ted Timbers.",gothamist.com,news,Gothamist,,0.3411764705882352,448985430,1,https://cms.prod.nypr.digital/images/344080/fill-1200x650|format-webp|webpquality-85/,

Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) increased the standard deduction, lowered the corporate and estate tax rates and increased the child tax credit, among other things.

While some people may be affected more than others, a number of tax breaks are set to expire at the end of December 2025 and revert to pre-TCJA rules.

""As crazy as it may sound, December 31, 2025, will be here soon,"" tax attorney Adam Brewer, with AB Tax Law, told Nexstar. ""If Congress doesn't take action to extend the cuts or pass new tax cuts, then the average American can expect to see their tax bill increase slightly in tax year 2026.""

Some residents of high tax states like California, New York and Massachusetts could actually benefit thanks to the scheduled expiration of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, Brewer said.

SALT allowed taxpayers to deduct certain taxes paid to state and local governments - including property taxes and either state income or sales taxes, but not both - on their federal income tax returns.

""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) significantly increased federal standard deduction amounts (thereby reducing the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions) and capped the total SALT deduction at $10,000,"" according to the Tax Policy Center. ""As a result, the share of filers claiming the SALT deduction fell to 9 percent, with the estimated revenue costs dropping to $13.5 billion in 2020.""

The standard deduction will be roughly half of what is now, adjusted for inflation, if the TCJA expires.

Deductions eliminated by the TCJA include the mortgage interest deduction and most miscellaneous deductions, such as investment/ advisory fees, legal fees, and unreimbursed employee expenses.

Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) increased the standard deduction, lowered the corporate and estate tax rates and increased the child tax credit, among other things.

While some people may be affected more than others, a number of tax breaks are set to expire at the end of December 2025 and revert to pre-TCJA rules.

""As crazy as it may sound, December 31, 2025, will be here soon,"" tax attorney Adam Brewer, with AB Tax Law, told Nexstar. ""If Congress doesn't take action to extend the cuts or pass new tax cuts, then the average American can expect to see their tax bill increase slightly in tax year 2026.""

Some residents of high tax states like California, New York and Massachusetts could actually benefit thanks to the scheduled expiration of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, Brewer said.

SALT allowed taxpayers to deduct certain taxes paid to state and local governments - including property taxes and either state income or sales taxes, but not both - on their federal income tax returns.

""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) significantly increased federal standard deduction amounts (thereby reducing the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions) and capped the total SALT deduction at $10,000,"" according to the Tax Policy Center. ""As a result, the share of filers claiming the SALT deduction fell to 9 percent, with the estimated revenue costs dropping to $13.5 billion in 2020.""

The standard deduction will be roughly half of what is now, adjusted for inflation, if the TCJA expires.

Deductions eliminated by the TCJA include the mortgage interest deduction and most miscellaneous deductions, such as investment/ advisory fees, legal fees, and unreimbursed employee expenses.

""These will once again be allowed, starting Jan. 1, 2026, under the previous rules, to the extent they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income,"" according to Joshua Youngblood, senior tax adviser with the Youngblood Group.

If Congress fails to pass a tax bill in time, one of the changes that will affect the average American is the expiration of the TCJA's lower tax rates.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the tax rate for nearly all income brackets.

""Those married filing a joint return in a 12% tax bracket ($22,001 to $89,450) will increase to 15%,"" Youngblood said, citing one example. ""Those in a 22% tax rate ($89,451 to $180,000) will increase to 25% from 22%.""

Families will also see the child tax credit, which was doubled to $2,000 under the TCJA, revert to $1,000 per child.

One of the major changes that will affect many small businesses and the self-employed is the elimination of the qualified business income (QBI) deduction.

The QBI ""is a deduction of up to 20% for pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations,"" according to Youngblood. ""This also includes sole proprietorships.""

Self-employed people who might qualify for the deduction include gig economy workers, artists, Etsy sellers, contractors, restaurateurs, freelancers and various small business owners, according to tax services company Jackson Hewitt.

One business-related TCJA change that won't expire at the end of 2025 is the flat 21% corporate tax rate. Before the 2017 tax code change the top rate was 35%, according to Youngblood.

Despite the broad changes to the tax code, Brewer says he's not recommending that his clients put a lot of energy into planning just yet.

""When we have the results of the presidential election, hopefully in November or December of this year, then a clearer picture of future tax rates may begin emerge,"" Brewer told Nexstar.

If the TCJA tax bill appears likely to expire, both Brewer and Youngblood say some taxpayers may want to realize any sizable investment gains before the tax rates increase.

""Given the complete dysfunction in Congress,"" Youngblood said. ""I think it is wise to at least look at some planning in the event there are no changes.""

Along with taking a look at any rapidly growing investments, Youngblood also recommends that business owners work with a tax adviser to review the structure of their businesses.

""Often, people think a C Corporation is only for large businesses, and that is not true,"" Youngblood said. ""It can make sense for a small business.""

Another planning opportunity, he said, is to create a plan to maximize QBI deductions before the deduction expires.",thehill.com,news,The Hill,,0.1137254901960785,448984848,1,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1441371670-2.jpg?strip=1&w=640,eng-9414915

The 2024 tax-filing season kicked off on February 19, and the filing deadline for 2023 tax returns, together with payment of tax payables, is April 30. Individual taxpayers should prepare early and take advantage of the deadline to avoid penalties (5%) and interest charges (10%).

More importantly, taxpayers must know how to get their money back through various tax exemptions, benefits, credits, and refunds.

The basic personal amount (BPA) changes yearly, and for the 2023 taxation year, the new BPA has increased by 4.1% to $15,000. All individual taxpayers can claim this non-refundable tax credit to reduce their overall tax liability.

However, the federal government adjusted the federal income tax brackets by 4.7% to account for inflation. The tax due at the lowest income bracket, or income of up to $53,359, is 15%. Income above $235,657 is taxed at 33%, the highest of five income brackets.

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) offers substantial tax relief. This tax-free monthly payment indirectly covers the cost of raising children. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recalculates the child tax benefit yearly. For the 2023-2024 benefit year, taxpayers or families can receive up to $7,437 per child under six and $6,275 per child aged six through 17.

According to Employment and Social Development Canada, the new child tax benefit represents a 6.3% increase from the previous year and should make a real difference.

The claimant must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident caring for or raising at least one child under 18. You can check with the CRA for other eligibility requirements or concerns.

Did you contribute to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) on or before February 29, 2024? If you did, the contribution is tax-exempt, and the CRA will deduct the taxes you paid from your tax bill. However, if you missed the deadline, remember you have 60 days from year-end to make RRSP contributions.

For 2024, the RRSP contribution limit is 18% of earned income reflected in the 2023 tax return or up to $31,560. Assuming you made RRSP contributions but didn't reach the maximum, the unused contribution carries over to the following year.

The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) annual contribution limit increased to $7,000 2024. Unused contribution rooms also roll over each year. Since all earnings, dividends, and gains inside a TFSA are tax-free, it offsets tax payables or serves as instant tax refund.

National Bank of Canada (TSX:NA) is an eligible and ideal holding in the tax-advantaged account. The $38.23 billion bank pays a decent 3.8% dividend. At $112.34, you can buy 62 shares with the $7,000 limit. Your investment will transform into a $66.50 quarterly passive income.

Canada's sixth-largest bank is a solid investment like its larger peers. Moreover, current investors enjoy an 11.62% year-to-date gain, which is the best performance among the Big Six. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, net income increased 5% to $922 million despite the 39.5% year-over-year increase in provision for credit losses to $120 million.

Some accountants or groups petition for an extension, but the CRA usually denies them. The 2020 COVID year was the only recent exception.

Frequently championed by Democrats, state tax credits for movie and TV productions are intended to juice local economies by creating jobs and boosting revenue for small businesses that provide services like catering and transportation. That, in turn, is supposed to generate more tax dollars.

But despite the $25 billion spent so far, states are seeing paltry returns on their investment -- sometimes less than 20 cents on each dollar given away, according to studies cited in a New York Times report.

A recent report prepared for state auditors in Georgia estimated that the tax revenue returned on each dollar spent on incentives was 19 cents. A similar report from New York determined the return was between 15 cents and 31 cents.

Sometimes, the losses are far worse, the Times reported.

When Michigan offered tax incentives to Hollywood, the Detroit suburb of Allen Park sold $31 million in bonds to turn a site that had once been occupied by an auto parts manufacturer into a movie studio that it hoped would employ thousands. But the project fell apart in 2010, and the city was forced to slash the pay of its police officers and firefighters to pay for the fiasco.

""The city got taken advantage of,"" Sgt. Grant Peace, a firefighter who took a 10 pay cut, told the Times. ""And it hurt our pocketbooks.""

Michigan stopped offering the giveaways about a decade ago after a state economist determined that ""the film incentives represent lost revenue"" and that their economic benefits were ""negligible.""

But that isn't stopping some Michigan Democrats from trying to revive the Hollywood boondoggle.

""We're not on an even playing field,"" state senator Dayna Polehanki (D) told the Times. She is one of the sponsors of legislation that would bring back Michigan's incentive program, though in a form that Democrats say will be more fiscally responsible.

But there's still plenty of skepticism about the efficacy of such programs.

""You could find almost an unlimited number of better uses for the same dollars,"" Michael Thom, a tax expert at the University of Southern California, told the Times.

HES-1 has several well conserved domains, from Drosophila to mammals, and is expressed in a variety of tissues, in both embryos and adults. The most described function of HES-1 is as the primary effector protein in Notch signaling, as an inhibitor of differentiation, where expression of HES-1 maintains precursor cells undifferentiated and in a proliferative state. In breast cancer cells, exogenous expression of HES-1 abolishes the estrogen-induced proliferation, whereas endogenous HES-1 expression is repressed in response to estrogen. These background data suggest that breast cancer cells need to repress HES-1 expression in order to proliferate in response to estrogen. The general aim of this thesis was to determine the role of HES-1 in estrogen- and retinoic acid-regulated proliferation of human breast cancer cells. In study I, we show that HES-1 is a mediator of retinoic acid-induced inhibition of proliferation in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Increasing levels of retinoic acid caused increasing expression of HES-1, followed by decreasing proliferation. By stably expressing a dominant negative HES-1 in MCF-7 cells the endogenous activity of HES-1 was inhibited and the cells become unresponsive to retinoic acid. In study II, we show that exogenous expression of HES-1 causes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We found the cell cycle factor E2F-1, critical for G1 to S-phase progression, to be regulated by HES-1, via a cis-element in the 5 regulatory region of the E2F-1 gene. HES-1 was shown to mediate the negative regulation on E2F-1 expression induced by retinoic acid, as indicated by the lack of the negative effect when expressing the dominant negative HES-1. We also found that HES-1 antagonizes the effect of another mitogen, heregulin-beta1. The heregulin-beta1 induced E2F-1 expression and the subsequent proliferation were inhibited by overexpression of HES-1. In study III, we investigated the mechanism by which HES-1 is regulated in response to estrogen and retinoic acid. There is a retinoic acid response element 18 kb upstream of the HES-1 gene that was bound by retinoic acid receptor alpha and activated transcription in response to retinoic acid. Results from a whole-genome estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding site mapping experiment, show ERalpha binding 23 kb downstream of HES-1 gene. ERalpha binds and regulates transcription via a novel cis-element, containing one consensus estrogen response element and a half site. ChIP assays revealed that ERalpha, coactivators and corepressors were recruited to this cis-element in response to estrogen. Importantly, a decrease in acetylation of histone H3 and H4 and a decrease in recruitment of RNA POL II were observed, indicating a repression of HES-1 expression in response to estrogen. In study IV, we show that retinoic acid mediates the induction of HES-1 gene expression via the transcription factor SOX9. We found SOX9 bound to a cis-element 3.7 kb upstream of HES-1 gene in response to retinoic acid. This cis-element regulated transcription induced by retinoic acid. In conclusion, these results establish HES-1 as a mediator of the cell cycle arrest induced by retinoic acid, and suggest HES-1 to be an important regulator of proliferation of breast cancer cells.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.4196078431372549,448983039,1,,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

South Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.",easternmirrornagaland.com,news,Eastern Mirror,,0.4745098039215687,448982386,1,https://easternmirrornagaland.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/202403243136544-1024x1024.png,

Florida has plenty of sun and a few incentives to make buying solar panels a bit easier. While it's not on CNET's list of the seven best states for solar incentives, Florida encourages solar panel installations in a couple of ways.

Florida legislates both sales tax and property tax exemptions for solar panels, continues to mandate net metering policies for excess solar generation and is one of only three states that offer property-assessed clean energy (PACE) loans for solar. Florida's state-based solar programs are also reinforced by a host of local and municipal-based incentives.

Some critics have challenged solar policies in Florida. The state legislature passed a law to end net metering but was rebuffed by the governor's veto. PACE loans have come under fire for their lack of transparency. It's more important than ever for Floridians to know what's going on with solar panel incentives in their state.

Depending on where you live in Florida, you can still get good money back for installing solar panels or a solar water heater. Learn everything you need to know about solar incentives in Florida.

Note: All of the solar incentives listed below are for residential electric customers in Florida. There are different solar incentives for businesses, schools and other organizations. The incentives are current as of March 22, 2024.

* Estimated value calculated by using a national average of $24,000 for installing solar panels and 0.98% for average Florida property tax

There aren't currently any state tax credits for solar panels in Florida right now, but there are other tax incentives and sources of financing for solar installations that are available to everyone in Florida.

Solar panels and other renewable energy investments like wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps are exempt from property tax assessments in Florida. That means that even if the value of your home increases from the installation of solar panels, you won't have to pay more in property taxes because of it.

The average property tax in Florida is 0.98%, according to AARP. There are lots of different ways to calculate the value of adding solar panels to a house but using a $24,000 average cost of installation, that property tax exemption will save Floridians who install solar panels about $235 per year.

Florida is only one of 13 states that offer sales and property tax exemptions for solar panels. A 2022 Florida law stipulates that solar panels and solar energy equipment are exempt from state sales tax.

Since Florida state sales tax is 6%, the exemption on solar panels and equipment will save homeowners $1,440 on an average $24,000 solar panel installation.

Florida is one of three states (along with California and Missouri) that allow property-assessed clean energy loans for solar panels. PACE loans allow homeowners to install solar panels with no upfront cost. Instead, a lien is placed on the property for the value of the solar panel installation, and homeowners pay off the money as a line item in their property tax bills. Terms for PACE loans are usually five to 20 years.

PACE loans don't require a credit check and are an easy way to make renewable energy improvements, but PACE programs in Florida have come under fire due to a lack of state oversight. Since PACE loans require a lien on the property, there's an additional risk of foreclosure for nonpayment. Some lenders -- particularly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- won't issue mortgages for properties with PACE liens, meaning you'd need to pay off the loan completely to sell your house.

The Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) encourages underserved communities to install solar panels by providing advantageous financing for solar installations. Borrowers get a fixed rate of 7.99% to 8.25% for loan amounts of $3,000 to $25,000 over terms of three to 10 years.

There is no minimum credit score or minimum income required to be eligible for a SELF loan, but you must be current on your property taxes and have paid your mortgage on time for at least the past 90 days. The program occasionally offers other rates, like a 10-year loan at 6.99% offered in early 2024.

There are only a few local rebates for solar panels in Florida right now. Most local rebates are for solar water heaters or attic fans. We'll continue to update this space as new solar incentives in Florida arise.

Boynton Beach is an Atlantic Coast city in Florida offering money back for solar investment. The city currently gives $1,500 back for installation of qualifying solar panel systems. The solar installation must have at least 5kW capacity and 17.5% efficiency to be eligible for the rebate.

Is it a grant or a rebate? Does it matter? Located to the west of Tampa on the Gulf Coast, the city of Dunedin gives residents and businesses money for installing solar systems. The rebate/grant is based on solar panel system capacity. Residents can get $0.25 per watt of solar power generated up to a maximum of $2,500. Yearly funds are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, and projects must be completed and permitted by Oct. 1 each year.

Florida might only have a few rebates for solar panels, but cities and local utilities offer rebates for solar water heaters, solar pool heaters and solar attic fans. Here are all the rebates for solar appliances that we were able to find in Florida.

Serving the beach cities east of Jacksonville, Florida, Beaches Energy gives its customers up to $1,250 back for energy-efficient upgrades, including $500 for the installation of a solar water heater.

Clay Electric Cooperative provides its customers with rebates for energy efficiency upgrades like foam insulation and heat pumps. Its rebate for solar water heaters is based on the capacity, paying $0.01 per output BTU for a maximum rebate of $600.

Located an hour north of West Palm Beach, publicly owned Fort Pierce Utilities provides customers with rebates for Energy Star appliances, insulation and other efficiency upgrades. Qualifying solar water heaters can get a $450 rebate.

Jacksonville-based JEA gives its residential customers a wide range of energy efficiency rebates, including $400 for those who convert from an electric water heater to solar.

Along with rebates for efficient refrigerators, ceiling fans and dishwashers, Keys Energy gives its residential customers $450 for solar water heaters.

South of Daytona Beach, the coastal utility of New Smyrna Beach only offers customers a few efficiency rebates, but one of them is for solar attic fans. Qualifying purchases can get 25% back of the installation cost, up to a maximum of $150.

Ocala Electric customers who make the switch from an electric water heater to solar are eligible for one of the utility's many efficiency rebates. Qualifying solar heaters can get $450 back.

OUC offers up to $900 back as an energy efficiency rebate for installing solar water heating. Customers must use one of OUC's ""preferred solar contractors"" to be eligible for the rebate, which doesn't include solar pool heating.

Along with special financing for solar water heaters (see below), Tallahassee also provides a rebate of $450 for switching from electric to solar. The rebate shows up as a credit on customers' electric bills.

For financing solar panels, Florida residents have several local loan options, along with the statewide PACE and SELF loans mentioned above. The following cities and local electrical providers offer special loans for solar panel installations or solar water heaters.

Clay Electric offers fixed-rate loans for 24 different energy-efficiency home improvements, including solar water heaters and solar pool heaters but not solar panel installations. Customers can borrow between $1,000 and $10,000 at rates of either 5% or 8%, depending on their credit rating. Loan terms depend on loan amounts, but the maximum repayment period is seven years.

Way down south in the Florida Keys, FKEC gives homeowners simple-interest loans of up to $35,000 for installing solar panels. The loan must be repaid within 10 years through monthly bill payments, and homeowners must have a 12-month clean billing history to qualify.

Lakeland Electric provides interest-free loans from $500 to $5,000 for renewable energy improvements including solar panels and solar water heaters to customers who have been in good standing for at least one year. The utility will place a lien on the property until the loan is repaid via monthly billing. The loan excludes the value of any tax credits or rebates on the solar panels, including the federal solar tax credit.

West of Fort Lauderdale, the city of Lauderhill offers interest-free loans of $400 to $2,500 for Energy Star appliances, as well as solar panel installations and solar water heaters. The loans must be paid back within two years. For solar panels, loan checks will be made payable directly to contractors.

Tallahassee Utilities provides 5% loans for 25 different energy-efficiency projects, including the installation of solar panels. You can get a maximum of $10,000 loan at a term of up to 10 years for solar panel projects that satisfy an energy audit. The city also provides loans for installing solar water heaters.

As with most other states, the biggest incentive for installing solar panels in Florida might be the federal solar tax credit, officially called the residential clean energy credit. It gives homeowners who install solar panels 30% of their cost back at tax time, a $7,200 value based on an average installation cost of $24,000.

There's no maximum to the credit although it is nonrefundable -- you can't receive more money than you owe in taxes. To claim the federal solar tax credit when you file your tax return, use IRS Form 5695 (or let the best tax software handle it for you).

Florida has required net metering programs for solar energy customers since 2008. Net metering is the practice of paying customers back for excess solar energy that is put back into the electrical grid.

The net metering law for Florida applies to the state's four major investor-owned utilities -- Duke Energy, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities and Tampa Electric Company. These companies must give customers credits for excess solar energy that are equal to their retail rates for electricity. Those credits can roll over monthly to pay future electric bills. At the end of the year, the utilities must pay customers for their unused credits based on an ""avoided cost"" rate that is lower than the retail rate.

Most regional and municipal electric utilities in Florida have net metering policies of their own, although they are not required to by law. Here is a collection of several local electric providers in Florida that provide net metering with links to their policies and rates.

The future of net metering in Florida remains uncertain. In 2022, state legislation to eliminate net metering passed both houses of the legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Florida does not have any laws requiring utilities to provide community solar programs to their customers. Community solar allows energy consumers to access solar power without installing solar panels on their homes. Instead, participants join solar projects that generate electricity for multiple homes using large-scale solar installations located elsewhere.

The following utilities provide solar programs that operate similarly to community solar projects. Some programs are currently full but offer waitlists for when spots become available:

The Florida Municipal Solar Project is a joint community solar effort between the Florida Municipal Power Agency and 16 public power companies across the state -- Alachua, Bartow, Fort Pierce, Havana, Homestead, Jacksonville Beach, Key West, Kissimmee, Lake Worth, Mount Dora, New Smyrna Beach, Newberry, Ocala, Orlando, Wauchula and Winter Park -- but only a few of those utilities currently offer community solar programs for their customers:",cnet.com,news,CNET,,0.3254901960784313,448982356,1,https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/ae3db0bfeddc2e4bd8f1387fabf0cc413af252a5/hub/2023/06/23/a7d8ba0e-1652-4e33-9db8-1ffe376a7d1d/florida-residential-solar-panels-gettyimages-1308882367.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,

Vakil Batirshin has massively swollen lymph nodes said to be caused by radiation-related illness. He lives in Ozersk - code named City 40 in Russia - which was built in total secrecy around the huge Mayak nuclear power plant by the Soviets in 1946.

For the first eight years after City 40 was built, Ozersk residents were forbidden from communicating with the outside world. Like Chernobyl, it was designed as a place to house the scientists working at the plant who - unbeknownst to the world - were leading the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons programme during the Cold War era.

Get the latest news on the Daily Star homepage.

Locals were told they were ""the nuclear shield and saviours of the world,"" and everyone on the outside was an enemy.

They also kept it a secret that the extreme exposure to radiation was affecting the health of the city's inhabitants. They started to get sick and die and the authorities were clandestine about the mortality rate.

However, the city's graveyard with all its young victims tells the story.

Ozersk, nicknamed ""The graveyard of the Earth,"" was surrounded by guarded gates and barbed wire fences and did not appear on any maps.

Its inhabitants' identities were also erased from the Soviet census to guard their secret.

The Mayak nuclear plant went through Russia's biggest nuclear disaster when the facility allegedly dumped 200million curies worth of radioactive material into the environment around Ozersk.

The residents also suffered the Kyshtym disaster in 1957, the worst nuclear disaster the world had seen before Chernobyl.

Radiation bathed the city when a cooling system exploded at Mayak with the force of 100 tons of dynamite.

One of the nearby lakes has been so heavily contaminated by plutonium that locals have renamed it the ""Lake of Death"" or ""Plutonium Lake"".

In an interview which resurfaced earlier this week on X (formerly Twitter), Vakil Batirshin struggles to speak, his neck is painfully swollen from lymph nodes that have grown to triple their normal size.

His exact diagnosis remains steeped in mystery as doctors say it can be hard to trace any one condition to radiation.

But asked if he has any doubt his symptoms are related to radioactivity, he said: ""Well, when I lived in my home village, I didn't have anything. Everything was great.

""When I came here, it all started.""

Another resident, Gilani Dambaev is riddled with diseases doctors think are linked to a lifetime's exposure to excessive radiation. He and his family have government-issued cards identifying them as residents of radiation-tainted territory.

He said: ""Sometimes they would put up signs warning us not to swim in the river, but they never said why. After work, we would go swimming in the river. The kids would too.""

Although the secret is now out and Ozyorsk resembles ""a suburban 1950s American town"" according to The Guardian, residents know their water is contaminated, their crops are poisoned, and their children may be sick.

Half a million people in Ozersk and its surrounding area are said to have been exposed to five times as much radiation as those living in the areas of Ukraine affected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

But most refused to leave, because while the Soviet population were suffering from famine and living in extreme poverty, the city was regarded as a paradise as authorities gave them private apartments, plenty of food, good schools and healthcare, and a plethora of entertainment and cultural activities.

Even still, residents opt against leaving. The Guardian reported that ""it is prestigious to live in Ozersk.""

Residents describe it as a town of ""intellectuals"", where they are used to getting ""the best of everything for free"".

Living in Mayak's nuclear shadow and resigned to her fate, one said: ""I don't hope for anything anymore. If we get sick, we get sick.""

Some locals, however, claim that long term dumping by the nuclear plant's management continues today.

The government has started resettling residents to new homes away from the river, but the process only began in 2008.

No. 1 Gamecocks, Tar Heels meet again in NCAA Tournament","COLUMBIA -- Courtney Banghart put it simply.

""This game has been played,"" North Carolina's coach said. ""I don't love it for the first two rounds, because there's so many good teams out there.""

South Carolina and the Tar Heels tangle again on Sunday in the NCAA Tournament's Round of 32, a rematch of a Nov. 30 game in Chapel Hill. That day, the Gamecocks pulled away in the fourth quarter to win, 65-58.

It's not exactly a unique matchup. The two teams play a lot, USC scrimmaging the Tar Heels in preseasons past, playing at Carmichael Arena in November and now meeting for the third time in the last four NCAA Tournaments, and fourth in the last nine.

""I like it as far as familiarity,"" USC coach Dawn Staley said. ""I also don't like it, in that I'd like to play somebody else.

""North Carolina is going to be a challenge for us, no doubt about it.""

The Gamecocks are favored, as they'll probably be throughout the tournament considering they're 33-0 and the No. 1 overall seed. But that means precisely nothing now.

That matchup in Chapel Hill, even though it was a loss, let UNC (20-12) know it could hang with the Gamecocks. If Te-Hina Paopao has a 3-pointer rim out, maybe UNC wins that game.

Banghart didn't say that she didn't want to play USC again because of the immense challenge; to the contrary, she listed teams they could have played instead. ""Iowa. That would have been neat,"" she said. ""We haven't played UCLA ... we scrimmaged them.""

But USC is the draw, and the Gamecocks and Heels were each remembering the game in the Triangle.

""Our defense kind of ignited our energy in that game. I think we out-rebounded them that game,"" said UNC star Deja Kelly. ""We matched their intensity and their aggressiveness and that obviously lit a big fire under us.""

""We (weren't) really prepared for the physicality,"" USC center Kamila Cardoso said. ""Now we are.""

It was a battle (45 combined fouls, including technical fouls on Kelly and Ashlyn Watkins). As Kelly remembered, UNC won the rebounding game. The Gamecocks could not operate in the lane and were losing every race for every loose ball.

But Bree Hall had a team-high 15 points and Paopao drilled two 3s in the fourth quarter to put the Gamecocks ahead for good. UNC's Maria Gakdeng already labeled this a ""revenge game,"" but Alyssa Ustby demurred.

""I don't think it needs to be any more than the next team in the tournament,"" she said.

Each team has changed a lot since that day. The Tar Heels played three point guards on Nov. 30 who will not be available Sunday, leaving the job to Kelly. Also in Chapel Hill, USC freshman phenom MiLaysia Fulwiley played less than four minutes, Staley displeased with what she was doing on the court.

""I sat there and watched the whole game and it looked like a very physical game. I wasn't really aware of the defense, I wasn't aware of anything,"" Fulwiley said. ""I thought I knew everything but I really didn't. I feel like I'm just more ready now.""

Fulwiley scored 17 points in USC's tournament-opening romp over Presbyterian (another rematch from the regular season). Ustby and Kelly had 29 combined points (Ustby had 17 rebounds) as the Tar Heels just escaped Michigan State.

Hall did not play, sitting out with a mysterious ailment as a precaution. She declined to say what it was on Saturday and said USC is taking it day by day, but Staley said she expects her to play.

This game is also in Columbia, in an 18,000-seat building that should be mostly full. Each coach would like a different opponent but national TV will be broadcasting (ABC), and the winner advances to the Sweet 16.

The loser goes home.

""If you beat them, you have to beat them. They're not going to give you anything easy,"" Staley said. ""So it should be a battle.

And, like all teachers, they dealt with the COVID-19 disruptions in their profession: trying to engage and teach to camera-off students over Zoom.

But while a new survey indicates that teachers, in general, are not OK -- student behavior issues, chronic absenteeism, and learning loss are pushing morale underwater -- Black teachers have a better attitude than White teachers about their work.

""Black teachers report the strongest morale, while teachers who are White or of two or more races have more negative morale,"" according to the first-ever Education Week 2024 Teacher Morale Index. On a scale of -100, which is a completely negative attitude, to +100, which is a completely positive outlook, overall teacher morale is -13, but Black teacher morale hovers at around +10, according to the survey.

""The teaching profession -- a workforce of three million -- is at an inflection point that could shape the course of the profession for the next generation of educators and students,"" according to the survey report. ""For the last few years, teachers have reported high levels of burnout and disillusionment -- borne initially from the hardships of teaching in a pandemic and exacerbated by the escalating academic, social, and mental health needs of students.""

The survey doesn't pinpoint why Black teachers feel more positively about their work. But some experts believe that teaching -- historically held in high esteem by the Black community, and one of few professions open to Black people during the Jim Crow era -- may be seen as more of a calling than just a job.

""In my opinion, Black teachers may be experiencing higher morale than their peers given the underlying purposes and motivations behind their work, but also community empowerment and racial uplift,"" says Sonya Douglass, founding director of the Black Education Research Collective at Columbia University Teachers College.

""The Black freedom struggle for equal education has always been just that -- a struggle,"" she says. ""So one could argue that challenging circumstances or environment might not have the same impact on Black teachers as their non-Black colleagues.""

Hiewet Senghor, founder of the nonprofit Black Teacher Collective, agrees, noting that Black teachers are just 7 percent of a workforce dominated by White women. But she also points out that the 10 percent positive morale of Black teachers isn't all that high, and they likely experience the same frustrations and burnout rates as their White peers.

""A more asset-based idea would be that Black teachers oftentimes have developed skills and capacity to make a way out of no way or make a dollar out of 15 cents,"" Senghor says. ""So they have better adaptability and problem-solving skills to work through the same challenges that teachers used to serving in less resource-starved schools do.""

The data illustrates the point. White teachers not only ""sharply outnumber educators of other races and ethnicities, but they also tend to work in different school environments,"" according to a 2021 study by the Pew Research Center.

The highest percentage of Black teachers -- 14 percent -- work In Title I schools, where 75 percent or more students receive free or reduced lunches, according to the Pew study. By comparison, according to the study, schools where 25 percent or fewer students qualify for subsidized lunches have a Black teacher workforce of just 2 percent.

In schools where at least 90 percent of students were minorities, 20 percent of teachers were Black, according to the study. Yet in schools where at least 90 percent of students were White, ""nearly all teachers (97 percent) also were White,"" the survey said.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis looked at national school funding data and found that schools with a 10 percent higher share of Black students than the district average spend $140 less per student on instruction.

Senghor said it's been established that Black teachers work longer hours for less pay than their White counterparts, in part because their roles often include informally guiding and mentoring Black students -- even if they work in majority White schools. Black women in the classroom, Senghor says, ""have historically engaged in ""other mothering,"" while Black male teachers often take on role modeling for Black boys.

It tends to happen ""outside formal teaching responsibilities, and the failure to recognize and compensate Black teachers for this is a significant barrier to Black teacher retention,"" she says. ""In my experience, Black teachers know this tax is a part of the experience, but their commitment and belief in the importance of Black teachers being there for Black students serves as a motivation to continue on.""

Ultimately, experts say, the best way to improve teacher morale, generally, is to improve working conditions, as well as offer more classroom and administrative support. But Douglass and Senghor agree that district and school administrators must recognize Black teachers' special role in the profession.

""Historically, Black teachers viewed education as a way to not only teach children and youth, but as central to community empowerment, racial uplift, and liberation,"" Douglass says. ""As Malcolm X said, 'Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.'""",afro.com,news,AFRO,,0.003921568627450966,448981319,1,https://i0.wp.com/afro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ruben-rodriguez-IXTvnOOSTyU-unsplash-scaled.jpg?fit=675%2C1200&ssl=1&w=640,

The International Maritime Organization held its latest round of negotiations to discuss how to move forward on the climate regulation of the shipping industry, which accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions.

Thirty-four countries from high- and low-income states expressed backing a universal greenhouse gas price, reflecting a significant upswing in support from the last round of talks in 2023.

Campaigners attributed building momentum for the policy to support from Caribbean Island states and said it now appeared likely that the measure would be adopted by the IMO next year.

The latest round of talks marked the first convention of the IMO since maritime nations agreed on a new greenhouse gas strategy in July last year.

The revised policy, backed by 175 countries, targets to slash shipping emissions by 30% by 2030, by at least 70% by 2040 and to get to net zero by the middle of the century.

As part of that agreement, the IMO agreed to implement some form of an emissions price in 2025, seeking to help close the price gap between fossil fuels and green energy and to use the revenue generated to fund an equitable transition.

However, there are other proposals to incorporate a potential levy as part of other measures. At least 14 countries continue to favor this approach.

""The UN is on the edge of adopting the world's first-ever global emissions price, but the policy will only be as successful as countries make it to be,"" said Sandra Chiri, shipping emissions international outreach manager at the Ocean Conservancy, a U.S.-based advocacy group.

""The March talks at the IMO gave us hope that a clear majority of countries -- those in the Caribbean, the Pacific, Africa, but also the EU and Canada -- have seen the huge opportunity of pricing shipping emissions for the industry's clean transition and for making sure that all developing countries are part of and benefit from it.""

Chiri said in a statement that it was ""regrettable that a small but persistent minority"" sought to water down the proposal. The shipping sector, which transports more than 90% of global trade, is regarded as one of the hardest industries to decarbonize, partly owing to the vast amounts of dirty fossil fuels the ships burn each year.",endtimeheadlines.org,news,End Time Headlines,End Time Headlines,0.3333333333333333,448981312,1,https://endtimeheadlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shutterstock_1417504214.jpg,

I believe that there is a design flaw in how the mortgage credit is being processed. I applied for the credit on behalf of my sister-in-law and submitted her mortgage interest certs through Revenue myAccount. Her Revenue 2023 statement of liability was issued but the credit was not applied by Revenue.

She did not pay tax in 2023 due to other personal credits. She has a single-parent child carer tax credit that negated the PAYE tax due in 2023

She had two calls with Revenue to tell her over the phone that it was rejected. This is a single person of two children who is doing her best to pay her mortgage during a period of 10 rate increases in 18 months. The Government promoted this as a cost of living measure to help families in 2024. She, of all people, is who this credit should be targeted towards.

I do not think the interest relief should be based on your income or tax. It should be based on the increase of interest paid in one year compared to another. This scheme should not have gone through Revenue as it is not an income-based credit. Is there anything she can do at this point.

Mr F.H.

You highlight a very unfortunate situation. As you point out, your sister-in-law sounds precisely like the sort of person that this tax credit was supposed to be helping. However, as it is framed, she does lose out.

When you say there's a design flaw here, I think you might be wrong. It is certainly designed in a way that will mean it is absolutely no use to your sister-in-law but, as I understand it, the Government, or at least those drafting legislation on its behalf, designed it very specifically to be a tax credit which means it automatically (by design) rules out those who do not pay tax.

Tax credits and tax reliefs work in different ways. The situation is further confused by the Government calling this both a relief and a credit, and by the previous experience of mortgage interest relief when it applied between 2004 and 2021, where it was treated as a relief and not a credit.

Tax credits essentially reduce the amount of income tax you pay. Revenue applies them after your tax has been calculated so if there is no tax outstanding, the credit falls unused.

Tax reliefs on the other hand generally operate earlier in the calculation, reducing the amount of income tax is taxable in the first place or else making you eligible for a repayment of tax already paid.

A third way they operate is what used to happen the last time we had mortgage interest relief. In this case, the relief was applied at source by the lender to reduce the homeowner's interest bill on the mortgage.

It can be easy to confuse the two. And, in this case, it seems the Government itself is none too clear about what it is doing as the measure was described as mortgage interest tax relief in Minister for Finance Michael McGrath's budget speech and subsequently, when it fact it is constructed as a tax credit.

At the time, he said he was ""acutely conscious of the impact of rising interest rates and mortgage costs on many households"" and, as you say, presented the measure as part of a package of ""cost of living"" measures designed to ease the burden on hard-pressed families.

The 2023 Finance Act (no 2) - the legislation giving effect to those Budget 2024 measures - didn't help by referring to ""Mortgage Interest Relief"" but then determining that it would be known as ""mortgage interest tax credit"".

Even when he announced the scheme open for applications on January 31st by the Minister, it was referred to as mortgage interest relief.

In another sign that the Government is less than certain what it is proposing here, the Minister estimated back at budget time that 165,000 mortgage holders would benefit. By January 31st, that number had jumped by more than a quarter to 208,000 mortgage holders ...but the Minister and his department did not upgrade the expected bill for the measure from the €125 million announced in the budget speech.

But what counts is what is in the law. And section 13 of the Finance (no 2) Act 2023 adds a new section 473 C to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which says:

""An individual (referred to in this section as the 'claimant') who proves that during the qualifying period he or she paid qualifying interest and makes a claim in that regard shall be entitled to a tax credit (to be known as the 'mortgage interest tax credit') equal to the lesser of:

(a) an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the specified amount, and;

(b) the amount which reduces the claimant's income tax to nil.""

That last bit is where your sister-in-law gets caught.

Someone may come back to put me wise on this but I do not see why the special once-off support for mortgage holders announced in the last budget could not have been applied in a similar manner. But it wasn't.

As framed, the mortgage interest tax relief is available to homeowners who at the end of 2022 had a mortgage on their principal private residence (family home) with a balance of between €80,000 and €500,000 outstanding, and who were up to date with the local property tax bills.

It looked at the interest element of those homeowners' mortgage bills in 2023 and measured it against what they had paid in interest in 2022. Homeowners were entitled to 20 per cent of the increase in their interest bill back up to maximum relief of €1,250.

Where the homeowner was not paying the mortgage for the whole of 2022 or 2023, the benefit was worked out pro rata.

I'm assuming from your reference to her mortgage interest certificates that she certainly qualifies in terms of facing higher mortgage interest charges and was not on the same fixed rate through this period.

But here's the rub. In order to claim the relief, homeowners had to file a tax return for 2023 - even if they did not usually file a tax return as a PAYE taxpayer.

This appears to have been a deliberate choice by Government because the more natural approach, as with mortgage interest relief in the past, would be to assess it purely against the mortgage interest, or the increase in mortgage interest - as done with previous mortgage interest relief schemes. They chose not to do this - meaning that your sister-in-law and anyone else not actively paying tax gets no benefit even though they are, if anything, more challenged by the increases in mortgage interest over the past couple of years.

I suspect they were simply working under the impression that any family juggling a mortgage tax would have exposure to income tax and decided that was the easiest and cleanest way to operate what is intended as a temporary once-off credit for last year. It does also fit with a pattern to trying to gently force more and more PAYE taxpayers into filing annual tax returns.

It possibly never crossed their mind that someone who would benefit from the measure - and who certainly finds themselves under cost of living pressure as a single mum of two suffering the same increase in mortgage rates as others - might not have an offsettable tax liability.

The bottom line here is that your sister-in-law did not pay income tax last year because she had offsetting tax credits as a result of her single parent status. And because there is no outstanding tax bill after those credits are applied, there is nothing left against which to offset this mortgage interest tax credit.

You have already pursued some political channels. Given the wording of the law, I think that is the only approach that has any potential to address your sister-in-law's situation but I would not limit yourself to Opposition figures. You are more likely to get action by pressing Government TDs, starting with those in your sister-in-law's constituency.",irishtimes.com,news,The Irish Times,,0.3568627450980393,448981312,1,https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/eb6l8Q2w_jwn7RPnOtTeyUKovn4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/JOJBGFKDXRDLXNPDKTDLXBFCS4.jpg,eng-9414915

""This decision at the highest level of heads of state and government is a brilliant incentive for further reforms and catching up so BiH can enter the convoy which Ukraine and Moldova joined a little earlier, Plenkovic said in an interview with the Mostar-based HerceBosna Radio-Television.

He said that before the European Council session, he lobbied with officials of the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Luxembourg who had reservations about BiH's progress towards EU membership.

European Council President Charles Michel played an extremely constructive role in approving the opening of negotiations with BiH, he added.

Earlier in the day, Plenkovic received BiH Foreign Minister Elmedin Konakovic, congratulating him on the European Council's decision and saying that he was personally very happy about it.

Plenkovic is confident that BiH can accelerate progress towards the EU by delivering on reforms.

""The election law is the foundation. For me, as prime minister and HDZ president, it's key to resolve the issue of legitimate representation of Croats in the BiH Presidency because this anomaly has existed since 2006. That's not good. It's a message of disrespect for a constituent people and a distortion of the spirit, letter and agreement from Dayton.""

Plenkovic also stood up for the president of the HDZ BiH party, Dragan Covic, whom the US administration has criticised for insisting on establishing in Mostar a gas company that would build and manage a pipeline connecting BiH to Croatia. US officials insist this should be done by the Sarajevo-based BH Gas.

Croatia's strategic interest is to capitalise on its LNG terminal by enabling BiH to diversify its gas supply routes and to protect the interests of Croats in BiH at the same time, Plenkovic said.

""Whichever solution is found in BiH, it should be a solution under which Croats, as an equal constituent people - since gas is coming from Croatia to the area where Croats live in Bosnia and Herzegovina - must have a key role. There is no doubt about that for us. That's why we supported Dragan Covic.""

Speaking of voting in Croatia's 17 April parliamentary election abroad, Plenkovic said Croatian President Zoran Milanovic ""chose a bizarre date to hamper the voting of Croats outside Croatia.""

""I'm confident that many more Croats will go to the polls and vote for the HDZ,"" he said, adding that he expects his party to win all three seats in the constituency for the diaspora as it did in 2020.",n1info.ba,news,N1,,0.2784313725490195,448980409,1,https://n1info.ba/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/23/1706042213-2024-01-23T133813Z_1557210243_RC2MN5AW4991_RTRMADP_3_BOSNIA-EU-VON-DER-LEYEN-1200x800.jpg,

The Biden administration's pursuit of increased government revenue has turned its gaze skyward, with a keen focus on corporate jets as a potential source of additional tax revenue, as was recently reported in the New York Times. This scrutiny of private air travel represents a broader effort to compel large corporations to pay their fair share in taxes and to curtail tax evasion among the wealthy.

For years, private air travel has been synonymous with opulence and extravagance, drawing the ire of Democrats who seek to eliminate tax incentives that facilitate its use, according to the NYT report. From celebrities such as Taylor Swift to Fortune 500 CEOs, the perception of luxury associated with corporate jets has made them a prime target for reform.

At the heart of the issue are tax loopholes that have long favored corporate aviation over commercial airlines, allowing companies to write off the cost of jets more expeditiously and pay reduced fuel taxes, the NYT report noted. President Biden has seized upon this issue, incorporating plans to address corporate aviation taxation into his $5 trillion proposal for tax increases.

Speaking at his State of the Union address and a campaign event in Philadelphia, President Biden emphasized the need for big companies to contribute their fair share to the tax system, signaling his administration's intent to close loopholes and ramp up scrutiny of executives who utilize company planes for personal travel.

Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen echoed this sentiment at a Senate hearing, commending the Internal Revenue Service's efforts to combat abuse of corporate jet write-offs through a new initiative, as per the information provided in the NYT report. However, these proposals have elicited swift opposition from the corporate aviation industry, which argues that they unfairly penalize American companies reliant on private planes for essential business operations.

Ed Bolen, president and CEO of the National Business Aviation Association, expressed concerns over the lack of justification for targeting the corporate aviation sector for tax increases. According to the NYT report, he emphasized the importance of understanding the rationale behind these proposals and urged a more thorough examination of the facts.

While the likelihood of the budget's approval by Congress remains uncertain, the proposed measures signal a concerted effort to level the playing field and ensure that wealthy individuals and corporations contribute their fair share to federal investments and deficit reduction.

At the heart of the budget proposal are two key initiatives that would impact jet users. Firstly, there's a plan to incrementally raise the tax on jet fuel over five years, with the aim of reaching $1.06 per gallon from the current rate of 21.8 cents per gallon. The NYT report explained that the revenue generated from this increase would be directed towards the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which supports federal investments in airport and airway infrastructure. The Biden administration argues that the current tax rate fails to adequately capture the contributions of private jets, which represent a significant portion of flights handled by the Federal Aviation Administration but contribute disproportionately less to the trust fund.

The second proposal targets a tax break enjoyed by companies that purchase corporate jets, allowing them to deduct the cost of their planes more quickly than commercial aircraft. Under current regulations, businesses can write off the expense of a corporate jet over five years, compared to the seven-year period applicable to commercial airplanes, the report in the NYT said. The budget proposes aligning the tax treatment for corporate and commercial jets, introducing a seven-year ""bonus depreciation"" period for both categories of aircraft.

According to estimates from the White House, these proposals have the potential to generate $4 billion in revenue over a decade, signaling a significant contribution to deficit reduction efforts and investments in the American people.

Michael Kikukawa, a White House spokesman, emphasized the administration's commitment to creating a more equitable tax system, stating, ""This is about leveling the playing field for the middle class by making big corporations and the wealthy finally pay their fair share,"" according to the NYT report. Kikukawa highlighted the importance of cracking down on wealthy tax cheats and closing loopholes for corporate jet purchases as part of broader efforts to address fiscal disparities.

The White House's proposals coincide with recent initiatives from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) aimed at curbing abuses in corporate jet ownership. The information contained in the NYT report indicated that the IRS's crackdown targets companies that exploit loopholes in the tax code to claim excessive deductions on airplanes used for personal travel by executives, signaling a coordinated effort to ensure compliance and fairness in tax enforcement.

This heightened scrutiny of corporate jet usage comes amid concerns over potential tax evasion and the misuse of deductions related to private air travel.

Under current tax regulations, companies are permitted to deduct the expenses associated with maintaining corporate jets if they are used for business purposes. However, there have been instances where executives, shareholders, and partners have utilized company planes for personal trips while still claiming full deductions for these expenses, as per the NYT report. This practice has raised red flags within the IRS, prompting a comprehensive audit initiative to ensure compliance with tax laws.

The IRS audits will not only focus on companies and their corporate jets but also extend to the wealthy passengers who benefit from these flights. As was noted in the NYT report, the agency contends that individuals utilizing corporate jets for personal travel should report such trips as income, thereby closing potential loopholes in the tax code and preventing revenue loss.

Daniel Werfel, the IRS commissioner, highlighted the importance of enhanced technology in facilitating these audits during a speech at American University. According to the NYT report, he emphasized that the agency's upgraded digital infrastructure enables more rigorous analysis of flight data, allowing for a more comprehensive examination of inappropriate write-offs for personal use of corporate assets, including corporate jets.

However, not everyone is convinced that the IRS audits will yield the anticipated results in terms of recovering missing tax revenue. Ryan DeMoor, head of aviation tax at MySky, expressed skepticism, noting that many executives are required to utilize corporate airplanes, even for personal travel, the report added. DeMoor argued that finance departments tend to err on the side of caution when reporting aviation taxes due to the potential risks and costs associated with inaccuracies.

""They're falling into the fat-cat executive trope out there, which is just not the case,"" DeMoor asserted, as was reported by the NYT. He challenged the notion that Fortune 500 companies would jeopardize their reputations by attempting to save a nominal amount of tax money on flight expenses.

As the IRS ramps up its efforts to combat tax evasion related to corporate jet use, the debate surrounding the taxation of private air travel is likely to intensify, with stakeholders on both sides advocating for their respective positions on compliance, fairness, and the integrity of the tax system.",thejewishvoice.com,news,The Jewish Voice,,0.3960784313725489,448980245,1,https://thejewishvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Israel-Biden-Slams-article-1.jpg,

City commissioners recently approved the company's request to extend a previous payment-in-lieu-of-taxes deal to 50 years. That'll allow the company behind Annika Place to apply to Michigan State Housing Development Authority for a loan to build 52 more one- and two-bedroom apartments next door. Out of those, 19 will be set aside as permanent supportive housing for people who need it, including those in chronic homelessness.

It's the second time in as many years the company asked for, and got, a tax break from the city for what it's calling Annika Place II. Patterson told commissioners MSHDA previously rejected the company's request for Low Income Housing Tax Credits the agency awards on a competitive basis to a limited number of projects each year.

So the company is trying a noncompetitive route, Patterson said. They're still Low Income Housing Tax Credits, but they offer investors a smaller tax break than competitively awarded ones. Projects that use noncompetitive credits need money to fill a large financing gap since they bring in only 44 percent of investor equity compared to competitively awarded ones.

Enter Goodwill of Northern Michigan, which will put up $400,000 in money from Grand Traverse County's American Rescue Plan Act funds, Patterson said Friday.

That, plus a trio of mortgages from MSDHA, should be enough financing, including money specifically for filling financing gaps in permanent supportive housing projects -- another ARPA-funded program.

""That came at a critical time, because there was a big gap that MSHDA was wondering if they had enough money and loans to help us, and that $400,000 helped us to get closer,"" Patterson said.

Dan Buron, with the nonprofit, said county leaders agreed to reallocate the funding so the developer can complete the project. Project-based vouchers will help tenants in the 19 permanent supportive units to make the rent.

""That is a rare thing to have, and it's very important for this community and for our efforts to end chronic homelessness,"" Buron told commissioners.

The project offers a glimpse into the complex world of financing affordable housing. Projects require funding ""stacks"" from investors, housing agencies and more to be built, property tax breaks to secure that funding and, in many cases, rent subsidies for tenants.

Both phases of Annika Place have project-based vouchers for permanent supportive housing, Patterson said. The Traverse City Housing Commission administers these vouchers, which are attached to a particular housing unit. These vouchers are ultimately funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and allow tenants to pay 30 percent of their month's income for rent, whatever that might be.

While MSHDA generally funds vouchers for permanent supportive housing, Traverse City Housing Commission agreed to put up its project-based vouchers from HUD for Annika Place, Patterson said.

Tenants who aren't applying for permanent supportive housing must earn between 30 and 80 percent of area median income, Patterson said -- between $26,970 and $71,920 for a family of four, according to MSHDA.

Those tenants can also use Housing Choice Vouchers, but it's not required, Patterson said. It's another form of subsidy that lets renters make income-based rent payments, and which they can bring with them wherever they're accepted. These are funded through HUD and administered locally through Traverse City Housing Commission and, in Bellaire, Tip of the Mitt Housing.

Patterson said he's hoping he'll know if MSDHA will approve loans for Annika Place II within a few weeks. The developer wants to start construction at 1020 Hastings Street, west of Garfield Avenue and Annika Place, in the summer.

""We've talked to MSDHA about our timeline, and winter is coming,"" he said, laughing as the snow fell on Friday.

If approved and constructed, the company would pay 6 percent of net shelter rents to Traverse City instead of property taxes, city Attorney Lauren Trible-Laucht said.

That's the cost of rents paid, minus that of certain utilities. Patterson said the 50-year term aligns with the length of the MSHDA loans, and the developer must keep the entire building as affordable housing for the length of that mortgage.

The city previously granted a 16-year PILOT, likely to be renewed since financing would have required affordable housing over 45 years.

Meanwhile, construction continues at the first phase of Annika Place. Patterson showed city commissioners a video demonstrating the panelized building methods that can cut up to six weeks off build times. By sourcing these panels from an offsite factory, contractors can simultaneously lay the foundations while the factory starts making panels.

That also saves the company money, since for Annika Place II the company has to comply with prevailing wage laws for onsite construction work, Patterson said.

Annika Place should be ready for its first tenants in April, with all 53 units already leased, Patterson said.

The company also has a 260-applicant waitlist, and they'll get a shot at an apartment in the second phase.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo! Finance,,0.2392156862745098,448979929,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

This initiative falls under the Government Services Quality Charter, designed to elevate the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, guaranteeing a seamless and user-friendly experience for all customers.

In a press release today, the FTA revealed the successful implementation of three transformative strategies aimed at improving services for ""Tax Refund for UAE Nationals Building New Residences"", ""Issuance of Tax Certificates"" and "" Excise Goods Registration Inquiry Response.""

H.E. Khalid Ali Al Bustani, the Director General of the Federal Tax Authority, emphasised that this initiative reflects the FTA's commitment to elevating service standards to meet the highest global benchmarks and practices set forth in the Government Services Quality Charter.

Al Bustani explained, ""The FTA has significantly ramped up its efforts to execute a comprehensive plan in line with the Government Services Quality Charter. It has implemented effective transformation measures to expedite the completion of three priority services, minimising required documentation to deliver tangible outcomes swiftly and enhance customer experience.

He further added, ""In order to simplify procedures and enhance integration with other systems and entities, the FTA has refined the process for 'Issuance of Tax Certificates' to expedite their issuance and improve customer experience. This includes issuing the Tax Residency Certificates to enable applicants to benefit from tax treaties in which the UAE is a party, and the Tax Residency Certificate for Domestic purposes. Additionally, the FTA issues certificates for business activities. In terms of the chat service, the Authority has enhanced the 'Excise Goods Registration Inquiry Response' service to improve customer experiences and provide information about the services offered by the Authority through electronic systems to partners via a single channel.""

The Federal Tax Authority highlighted significant enhancements in three key services. These include cutting the processing time for the ""Tax Refund for UAE Nationals Building New Residences"" from 25 to 20 minutes. The number of steps was reduced from 6 to 5, and the fields were brought down from 35 to 28. Moreover, the FTA has also revamped its website's search feature to incorporate a direct service application link on the most visited pages for easier access. The number of mandatory fields in the application process was reduced, thereby expediting applications by utilizing essential information from the UAE Pass.

The number of necessary documents for the 'Issuance of Tax Certificates' service has been cut down from 6 to 5, while reducing the number of fields from 12 to 9. The key service enhancement measures include refining the search feature on the Authority's website for easier access to the service login link, automating data verification through electronic linkage, enabling the request for multiple certificate copies, integration with the UAE Pass, and providing Electronic Seal on the Digital Certificate for authenticity and validation.

The Federal Tax Authority clarified that for ""Excise Goods Registration Inquiry Response"", the service application time has been reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes, and the service delivery time has been cut from 2 days to 5 minutes. Key enhancements to the service include providing immediate responses to customer inquiries without redirecting them to the FTA's partners' websites, saving customers' time in accessing inquiry services, and offering information about the services provided by the FTA through its partners' platforms.",zawya.com,news,Zawya.com,,0.388235294117647,448978661,1,https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/NmU0NDI4YTgtMmEyNC00/8/directorgeneralh-e-khalidalbustani-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2,

In a 28-page decision, the SC sitting en banc reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals (CA), which had found the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) liable to pay the Bulacan provincial government a share in the use of water from Angat Dam.

""All told, the Court finds that the CA erred in affirming the RTC Decision which found petitioner liable to pay respondent a share in the utilization and development of national wealth,"" according to the decision, written by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting.

The Supreme Court said water impounded in a dam ceases to a natural resource, and thus cannot be subject to the tax on national wealth.

The tribunal decided otherwise, noting that the MWSS does not generate income or derive profit from the use and development of dam water. the MWSS was created for regulatory purposes, it added.

Diversification has become a key strategy for farm businesses in recent years, during a challenging period of high costs, volatile weather, political upheaval and a post-Brexit overhaul of subsidy payments.

One of the most common alternative income streams has been holiday lets, making use of vacant properties or converting unused agricultural buildings such as barns and cow sheds.

In his Spring Budget, chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that the Furnished Holiday Lettings tax regime will be abolished from April 2025, eliminating the tax advantage for landlords who let out short-term holiday properties over those who let out residential properties to longer-term tenants.

Chris Solt, agricultural partner at Norfolk-based accountancy firm Lovewell Blake, said the changes could prompt farmers to consider generating residential revenue instead.

""This relief essentially allowed the property owners to treat these as a business rather than an investment, resulting in tax advantages, provided they meet certain criteria including availability, actual bookings and the extent to which they are furnished,"" he said.

""The same restrictions on mortgage interest relief which apply to regular residential rents will also apply to furnished holiday lets from 2025, which could limit the interest some owners will be able to set off against profits if they used a mortgage for purchase or conversion.

""Currently where there is joint or shared ownership, the profits of a furnished holiday let can be split at the owners' discretion, rather than based on actual ownership percentages. This allows profits to be allocated to reward those who run the business. Rental incomes can be varied but owners will need to sign a Deed of Trust and a tax election.

""When it comes to selling a property which has been used as a furnished holiday let, there are advantageous capital gains tax reliefs available which cannot be used against regular residential lettings, such as business asset disposal relief, rollover relief and holdover relief.

""From April 2025, farming businesses may consider whether the profits currently generated from furnished holiday lets could be generated from long-term residential lettings, which require minimal owner input (compared to the bookings, changeover days, welcome packs, and so on involved with holiday lettings), without there being any difference in tax treatment.""",edp24.co.uk,news,Eastern Daily Press,,0.5215686274509803,448978314,1,https://www.edp24.co.uk/resources/images/14417247/,

WATERLOO -- The Waterloo Community School District may increase its tax collections by as much as 7% but, due to a new state law, residents will have an extra chance to voice their opinion.

The Board of Education will hold a 6:30 p.m. public hearing Monday for the maximum property tax levy at the Education Service Center, 1516 Washington St.

The state changed the process for taxing entities' budget hearings so now they must have two opportunities for public comment on proposed taxes. The public hearing must be a separate from a regular meeting. It will take place after Monday's regular school board meeting.

The district's maximum property tax askings could be $39.4 million - $2.6 million, or 6.9%, more than the current year. This is the most the district can ask for. The published amount can only remain the same or decrease.

The district's current property tax rate of $13.36 per $1,000 of taxable value could grow to $13.98, a 62 cent increase.

However, individual residential and commercial property owners could see a decrease in the school district portion of their tax bills for the fiscal year starting July 1. Due to recent changes in the state rollback (which determines the percentage of property value to be taxed), owners of property with an assessed value of $100,000 would pay $648 annually under the proposal. That's $82, or 11.2%, less than last year.

A final decision will be made on the property tax rate following the hearing at a later date.

Prior to the proposed budget hearing, during the regular meeting at 5 p.m., the school board could approve a purchase of more than $1 million for new student and teacher Chromebooks as well as carrying cases. This includes 3,585 computers and 2,445 cases.

The laptops would go to all sixth and ninth graders along with students at Poyner and Orange elementary schools because their computers are at the end of their life span.

The Arizona Daily Star Sportsmen's Fund raises money so children from low-income households and active military families can attend summer camp at little or no cost to their families.

Since 1947, the Sportsmen's Fund has helped pay for 44,007 children to go to camp. We're one of the oldest 501(c )(3) charities in Arizona and one of the most efficient, with 97 cents from every dollar going to send kids to camp.

We send local kids to weeklong YMCA, Boy Scout and Girl Scout overnight camps, as well as overnight camping at Camp Tatiyee for school-age children with special needs. Our goal is to raise $225,000 to send more than 500 kids to camp. So far, we've received 424 donations totaling 70,761.69, or about a third of our goal.

Nearly all of these donations were in response to the envelope placed in Star last month. More donations will be published in the coming week.

In January, the Angelos family agreed to sell the baseball team to private equity billionaires David Rubenstein and Mike Arougheti for $1.725 billion. The deal was structured such that the incoming ownership group would initially own 40% percent stake of the team and buy the Angelos' remaining interest following the death of Peter Angelos.

Now that Angelos has passed away, the option to acquire his stake in the Orioles can be exercised (it was only exercisable upon his demise) and the option holders, the buying group, can thus succeed to majority ownership of the team. For tax purposes, it was critical that the option only be exercisable upon his death. This restriction allowed the basis of Angelos' stake to be stepped-up to its date of death value. Accordingly, there will be no gain recognized upon the sale of his stake by his estate (or his heirs) since the selling price thereof and its basis will have been brought into equilibrium.

Says tax expert Robert Willens: ""His (Angelos') advisors structured the deal with precision and their handiwork allows the family to sidestep what probably would have been over $250 million in federal and local taxes.""

The sale to Rubenstein and Agougheti was approved by the Maryland Stadium Authority last week. The Stadium Authority owns Camden Yards, home of the Orioles, and recently approved to use $400 million in public money for ballpark improvements. The sale, which included the team's stake in its regional sports network, MASN, still needs to be approved by at least 23 of MLB's 30 owners.",forbes.com,news,Forbes,,-0.003921568627450966,448977521,1,https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6600131f8cd223fdce79386f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds,eng-9420620

A law to tax motor vehicles has finally landed in the Riigikogu. While some changes may still be introduced, it is likely people will have to pay a tax when first registering a vehicle in Estonia plus an annual usage tax. Seldom has a law sparked more debate and vocal protest in Estonia.

It is surprising that while plans to lay down a relatively modest car tax have resulted in ferocious protests and public debate, the January VAT hike from 20 percent to 22 percent failed to provoke a similar reaction. The higher VAT rate and the new car tax are estimated to yield more or less the same amount in tax revenue. Why is the car tax such a massive problem in a situation where higher taxation of staples - such as potatoes, rye bread and milk - is not seen as a concern?

President Alar Karis has said: ""Even the authors of the car tax do not seem to understand why it is needed. Here it is aimed at protecting the environment, while it's aimed at generating tax revenue elsewhere - it is confusing.""

If we ask whether the car tax aims to protect the environment or whether it's simply a way to collect more money as taxes, the answer could be that it's both, as is often the case with environmental or so-called win-win taxes.

Tax theory

According to tax theory, a government looking for additional tax revenue should tax products in the case of which demand (or supply) is non-elastic, meaning that changes in price do not greatly affect quantities sold.

The logic is simple. If the government taxes a product demand for which is elastic, the tax will work to drive away consumers, which will hurt sales and through it tax receipt. Taxing products with elastic demand also impacts consumer well-being by forcing them to drop products they like in favor of those they do not.

While taxpayers are expected to pay taxes, taxes that alter behavior constitute excess tax burden.

How a tax can alter behavior and result in excess tax burden can be explained using a simple example.

Let us imagine the government is weighing whether to tax apples or bananas. If the government decides to tax apples, those who love apples will switch to bananas because apples are now hugely expensive. In the end, the government generates very little revenue and apple fans are negatively impacted by having to eat bananas, which they don't like. According to tax theory, higher taxes should hit non-elastic demand products.

This logic applies to ordinary goods, while it does not always apply in the case of products that have a negative environmental impact. Economists say that a product has a negative external effect if it affects people other than those buying and selling. If I drive my car in Tallinn, it takes up space, emits CO2 and other pollutants, which have a negative effect on Tallinners and possibly beyond.

Economic theory tells us that products with negative external effects should be taxed to motivate the polluter to dial back their harmful action. Such taxes are referred to as corrective taxes as their aim is to offset harmful external effects.

If I have to pay more to use my car, I may drive less often or sell my car and use a bike instead. Such corrective taxes are most effective when applied to products with very elastic demand. While they will not generate much in terms of revenue, pollution will fall.

I believe the attentive reader has noticed that economic theory recommends applying very different tax policy to products that do not pollute and those that do. In the first case, governments should tax non-elastic demand products, while in the second case, it should be those with elastic demand.

This leads us back to the possibility of environmental taxes serving as win-win taxes. If demand proves elastic, pollution will fall. If demand is non-elastic, the government will generate revenue without resorting to excessive tax burden.

This can be applied to the taxation of vehicles in Estonia.

If demand for cars is very elastic, the car tax will not generate much revenue, while it will lower the number of cars, which will reduce gridlock and air pollution in major cities and help lower CO2 emissions.

If demand for cars is highly non-elastic, the tax will not alter behavior and the additional tax burden cannot be considered excessive. Taxing cars also makes sense from the perspective of social structure. Statistics shows that poverty is widespread among pensioners, while many pensioners do not own a car and are therefore not affected.

The example of Denmark

Interest groups have suggested that laying down a car tax makes Estonia look like a third world country. That is clearly not the case. Almost all European countries tax vehicles, while some of them sport very high tax rates.

I come from Denmark, which is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. In Denmark, the tax on new gasoline cars is around 100 percent of the cost of the vehicle to which a green usage fee is added, which comes to a lot of money in the case of ""thirsty"" gasoline cars. High taxes mean that cars tend to be much smaller in Denmark than they are in Estonia and many young people cannot afford to buy a car. Even so, most people in Denmark own a vehicle.

I believe that the taxation of cars will work similarly in Estonia. People will buy smaller cars, families may share a vehicle and some might start to drive less. Our cities will become a little more environmentally friendly and it is hoped that fewer people will be killed or maimed in traffic.

No one likes paying taxes, while those who pay the car tax can at least take solace in knowing that additional revenue is not created through even higher taxation of potatoes, bread and milk.",news.err.ee,news,ERR,,-0.02745098039215688,448976844,21,https://s.err.ee/photo/crop/2024/03/22/2318499h65ddt24.jpg,eng-9421578

The tax proposed by the party would be ""more targeted"" than a rise in valued-added tax (VAT), for example, and ""minimal"", he told the Le Matin Dimanche newspaper on Sunday.

""It will affect companies that carry out a lot of financial transactions. It also has the advantage of not affecting private individuals,"" said Pfister.

+ Swiss vote: 'yes' to higher pensions, 'no' to retiring later

The politician from Zug says he is also open to an increase in VAT or employee contributions. ""At this stage, anything is possible,"" he says. But ""thinking we can finance a 13th pension by saving here and there is an illusion,"" he continued, stressing that this would not be ""painless"".

An additional 13th state pension payment will also have to be paid to beneficiaries of invalidity insurance (AI), Pfister said.

""This is a direct consequence of the people's decision. To do otherwise would be to discriminate against AI pensioners,"" he said.

It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.In a report released Wednesday, the U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said some 62 million tons of ""e-waste"" was generated in 2022, enough to fill tractor-trailers that could be lined up bumper to bumper around the globe. It's on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.Metals -- including copper, gold and iron -- made up half of the 62 million tons, worth a total of some $91 billion, the report said. Plastics accounted for 17 million tons and the remaining 14 million tons include substances like composite materials and glass.The U.N. says 22% of the e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022. It is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade because of ""staggering growth"" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, growing ""electronification"" of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure, the agencies said.They said some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well as rare Earth metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers.

United Nations agencies have warned that waste from electronics is piling up worldwide while recycling rates remain low and are likely to fall even further.

The agencies were referring to ""e-waste,"" which is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery, including cellphones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels. It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.

In a report released Wednesday, the U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said some 62 million tons of ""e-waste"" was generated in 2022, enough to fill tractor-trailers that could be lined up bumper to bumper around the globe. It's on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.

Metals -- including copper, gold and iron -- made up half of the 62 million tons, worth a total of some $91 billion, the report said. Plastics accounted for 17 million tons and the remaining 14 million tons include substances like composite materials and glass.

The U.N. says 22% of the e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022. It is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade because of ""staggering growth"" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, growing ""electronification"" of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure, the agencies said.

They said some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well as rare Earth metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers. Currently, only 1% of the demand for the 17 minerals that make up the rare metals is met through recycling.

About half of all e-waste is generated in Asia, where few countries have laws on e-waste or collection targets, according to the report. Recycling and collection rates top 40% in Europe, where per-capita waste generation is highest: nearly 18 kilograms (39 pounds).

In Africa, which generates the least of any of the five big global regions, recycling and collection rates hover at about 1%, it said.

""With less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling.""

For some, e-waste represents a way to earn cash by rummaging through trash in the developing world to find coveted commodities, despite the health risks.

At the Dandora dumpsite where garbage collected from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi ends up -- even though a court declared it full over a generation ago -- scavengers try to earn a living by picking through rubbish for e-waste that can be sold to businesses as recycled material.

Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.

""When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health,"" he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he ""can't come to work because of chest problems.""

However, Okoth said they don't have any other options: ""We are now used to the smoke because if you don't go to work you will not eat.""

Recycling plants, like Nairobi's WEEE center, have collection points across Kenya, where people can safely get rid of old electric equipment.

""We take inventory of the items,"" said Catherine Wasolia, WEEE's chief operating officer, to check for data on submitted devices and wipe them clean. Then they test each to assess if ""it can be reused or repurposed.""

There's also a growing perception within the fintech industry of regulatory obstacles impeding sectoral growth.

Some fintech firms also put their support on record by writing to the finance minister and RBI governor after the central bank barred Paytm Payments Bank from accepting deposits.

While both self-regulatory organizations (SROs) -- Digital Lenders Association of India (DLAI) and Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) -- collectively representing around 120 fintech firms, do not have enforcement powers, they are of the opinion that the draft guidelines released by RBI on 15 January could help them enforce decisions among member firms.

To clear the air, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, in a media interaction, said that the central bank's actions were against a regulated entity (Paytm Payments Bank) and not against any fintech.

Shiv Chatterjee, co-founder, DMI Finance, a non-banking financial company, and an executive committee member of DLAI, believes RBI is apprehensive about trusting digital lenders to act responsibly, considering that there have been numerous instances where, knowingly or unknowingly, entities have clearly flouted norms.

""DLAI has tried, not always successfully, to highlight such instances, whenever it sees emerging practices that look antithetical to the regulations,"" he added.

The core businesses of DMI Finance, which acquired lending fintech ZestMoney in January, is corporate lending, housing finance, digital consumer and small business finance.

The challenge, however, is to enforce action against serial violators, said experts. In fact, on 15 January, RBI said fintechs were reshaping the landscape of financial services, but they must ensure a balance between facilitating innovation and meeting regulations, to protect consumers.

Self-regulation within the fintech sector, RBI said, is a preferred approach for achieving the desired balance.

Despite lacking enforcement powers, DLAI maintains a code of conduct, and is trying to standardise the norms, while considering RBI's suggestions. Chatterjee hopes that RBI will approve the SRO initiative in the early part of the next financial year.

""For the SRO, we are hoping that enforcement powers are not limited to just naming the entities that are non-compliant. It would be more effective if it has a more constructive role in shaping the sector, and inculcating compliance as a cornerstone of good behaviour,"" Chatterjee said

RBI has also been urging fintechs to look seriously at self-regulation. Calling it a ""critical issue"", Das said in September that fintechs ""need to evolve industry best practices, privacy and data protection norms in sync with the laws of the land, set standards to avoid mis-selling, promote ethical business practices, and transparency of pricing"". ""I would like to use this opportunity to urge and encourage fintechs to establish an SRO themselves.""

In fact, according to experts, the RBI draft guidelines explicitly state the importance of SROs for fostering the development of the fintech ecosystem.

""We were formed like an SRO for fintech lending and are working like one. Regulatory recognition is vital to legitimacy, credibility and enforcement. SRO recognition will incentivise membership to cooperate with information sharing and align with self-regulatory norms,"" said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer, FACE.

FACE has an oversight mechanism for its members, comprising 80% of digital lending business volumes, according to its website. The organization utilizes members' loan apps, websites, and social media platforms to pinpoint deficiencies in customer protection norms, such as consent, disclosures and complaint resolution.

""We encourage members to report unhealthy or non-compliant practices in the market or competition, and we independently verify the evidence. We also use customer complaint data, actual complaints, and surveys to understand customer challenges and act on industry-level customer issues,"" said Saxena.

In the third quarter of FY24, 37 fintech members of FACE had disbursed loans of ₹35,999 crore through non-banking entities, or in collaboration with other lenders, up significantly from ₹23,141 crore a year ago.

United States District Court Judge Mitchell S. Goldberg also ordered Fecondo to pay restitution. The announcement came from United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero.

Fecondo admitted guilt in 2022, acknowledging her failure to remit approximately $600,000 in employment taxes to the IRS for the years indicated in the indictment, as well as her failure to file both corporate and personal income tax returns. As the president and sole owner of Joseph Silvestri & Son, a mushroom farm business in Garnet Valley, Fecondo was responsible for collecting and paying over employment taxes. Despite withholding taxes from employees' wages, she did not forward these to the IRS.

From 2013 through 2016, Fecondo withheld but did not remit a total of approximately $1,255,068.94 in employment taxes. It was not until July 2017, after being contacted by the IRS regarding her failures, that she filed the overdue tax forms without remitting any of the owed taxes. Fecondo also failed to file her personal income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 and did not file corporate tax returns for JSSI for those years.

U.S. Attorney Romero emphasized the impact of Fecondo's actions on honest taxpayers, especially during tax season, stating that her sentence serves as a stern warning against tax fraud.

And that's especially true when it comes to sales tax.

In all, 45 states and the District of Columbia assess sales taxes on most purchases. There are, of course, exceptions -- and those vary from state to state, too.

Confusing, isn't it? GOBankingRates turned to the Tax Foundation for answers about state tax rates to find out where you'll pay the highest amount on your purchases. Keep reading to see why that list isn't exactly what it seems.

Five states do not assess a statewide sales tax, and they run from coast to coast. If you live in Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire or Oregon, you won't pay a state tax on your purchases.

Among the states that assess a retail tax, Colorado's rate is the lowest at 2.9%, per the Tax Foundation, meaning you'll pay $2.90 in state tax for every $100 you spend.

The other nine:

So, in which states can residents expect to pay the highest state taxes on retail purchases? These are the top 10 -- plus one more for a tie -- and they come with a caveat:

So what's the caveat? State taxes don't represent the only retail taxes assessed. In 38 states, local sales and use taxes are allowed to be assessed by counties and municipalities and added to the state tax, according to the Tax Foundation. And depending on where you're spending your money, the local taxes could equal or exceed the state tax.

In Albany County, New York, for example, the state rate of 4% is compounded by a 4% local tax. In Seattle, Washington, effective April 1, shoppers will have to figure in a local rate of 3.85% on top of a state rate of 6.5% for a total of 10.35%. That means a $100 purchase in Albany will total $108. In Seattle, prepare to pay $110.35 for that same $100.

And in Colorado, that low state tax rate of 2.9% isn't all you'll pay when you buy something. Colorado allows local governments to charge a sales and use tax that averages 4.907%, the Tax Foundation reports.

Even in Alaska, which doesn't charge a statewide tax, local taxes come into play. Alaska law allows for a local tax that averages 1.821 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. With that rate, Alaskans would pay $1.821 in retail taxes on every $100 purchase, adding $1.82 to a $100 total at checkout.

The five states that have the highest average combined local and state taxes, per the Tax Foundation, are:

The House passed the Protecting American Energy Production Act by a vote of 229-118, which would block a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing.

The bill specifically limits executive power and states, ""The President may not declare a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing unless such moratorium is authorized by an Act of Congress.""

The House also passed the ""Restoring American Energy Dominance Act,"" sponsored by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. The bill would stop the Bureau of Land Management from increasing royalty rates charged to companies drilling on public lands.

The House also has plans to take up several other energy-related bills and resolutions against President Joe Biden's ""radical, anti-energy agenda.""

Legislation on the agenda would repeal the greenhouse gas reduction fund, make it easier to build energy projects in wetlands and curb legal challenges from environmental groups.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, both Republicans from Louisiana, were among the leaders in putting together energy week. Both said they want to protect American energy dominance.

""People know they are paying too much because of the far-left agenda,"" Scalise declared in announcing energy week.

""We're bringing bills on the House floor next week that will promote American energy to lower costs for families who recognize this,"" Scalise said.

He planned to introduce his anti-carbon tax resolution.

Also on the agenda is legislation to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act's greenhouse gas reduction fund, ease approval requirements for pipelines and reduce the timeline for approval.

A list of the bills and resolutions considered are:

The package included in energy week brought support from industry leaders.

""This package of bills is an important step in pushing back against the anti-energy and anti-consumer Biden Administration and its war on U.S. domestic energy,"" said Karr Ingham, economist and president of Texas Alliance of Energy Producers.

""It is critical for our industry, our nation, and the world to promote and expand abundant, affordable, and reliable petroleum energy production and support efforts to maintain our economy. We applaud the U.S. House of Representatives for promoting sound energy policy and working to pass this important legislation,"" Ingham said.

The in-office service day for veterans will be held from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday, April 2 at the county assessor's office in the San Juan County Administration Building, 100 S. Oliver Drive in Aztec.

Staff members from the assessor's office and the New Mexico Department of Veterans Affairs will be on hand to help veterans and unmarried spouses of veterans file for property tax exemptions and 100% permanent and total service-connected disabled property tax exemptions, according to a news released issued by the county.

County officials say the exemptions will be granted to qualified applicants on the spot. Under state law, honorably discharged veterans who quality for the exemption can claim a $4,000 reduction off the taxable value of their primary residence, county spokesman Devin Neeley said. Those with a 100% permanent and total service-connected disability are allowed to waive their entire property tax bill.

Neeley said approximately 2,800 San Juan County veterans have earned the exemption, with about 100 new exemptions approved each year. The exemptions remain active each year unless a veteran moves, Neeley said.

PCC Kim McGuinness, who is also the Labour Party's candidate for North East mayor, confirmed last month that she would be imposing a 7.7% increase on the council tax police precept paid by households in Tyne and Wear and Northumberland. The results of a public consultation on the plans, which Ms McGuinness said were needed to ""rescue"" her force from needing to make more than £4 million of cuts and deliver new investment in frontline policing, showed majority support among those who took part.

But the PCC's office has now been accused of disproportionately targeting residents for responses in areas where crime numbers are lower. The results of a freedom of information (FOI) request show that households in North Tyneside and Northumberland, the two local authority districts in the Northumbria force area with the lowest rates of crime, received notably more letters from the PCC directing them to take part in an online survey.

A total of 38,438 letters were sent to Northumberland and 31,212 to North Tyneside. But only 20,000 were sent to Newcastle, 11,700 to Gateshead, 10,000 to Sunderland, and just 9,750 to South Tyneside.

Dan Dowling, a Northumberland resident who sent the FOI, said the discrepancy ""doesn't seem fair at all"". The PCC's office told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that its letter deliveries were done ""in the most cost-effective way"" and that its critics were spouting ""wild theories"".

Mr Dowling, of Haydon Bridge, said: ""The council tax precept was going up in all areas, so that means more people in North Tyneside are deciding what happens in Sunderland than the people who live there. That's not right.""

Independent councillors from around the region have alleged that the figures were ""skewed"" in favour of low-crime districts and to areas north of the Tyne. Marc Donnelly, an independent councillor in Newcastle, accused the PCC of being ""selective in where the letters were sent, to whom they were sent... and most likely taking into account crime statistics and figures"".

The crime rates in North Tyneside and Northumberland to the year ending September 2023 were 87 and 76 incidents per 1,000 population, according to the Office for National Statistics, while the other four council areas within the force boundary had a rate of 100 or above. A report from January detailing the results of the PCC's survey showed the highest number of its 1,337 responses did come from North Tyneside and Northumberland, with 276 each.

That report admits there was a ""slight under-representation of respondents from Sunderland and Newcastle, but over-representation of respondents from North Tyneside"".

North Tyneside independent councillor Cath Davis said there were ""real questions to be answered"". She added: ""If you're going to do a public consultation it needs to be fair and transparent and this one doesn't seem to stand up to scrutiny.""

Durham Council independent Alan Shield, whose patch is outside the Northumbria force area, claimed that the results indicated ""a serious element of misrepresentation"" that ""smacks of trying to influence the results"".

A spokesperson for the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, responded: ""121,000 letters were sent to Northumbria residents with deliveries booked in the most cost-effective way for maximum reach. North of Tyne we were able to distribute the consultation by adding letters onto pre-existing deliveries, which kept costs down. In other areas, there were no pre-existing deliveries available for us to add to, meaning we had to pay for new deliveries which is more costly, and therefore impacted distribution numbers. Deliveries were simply about getting maximum reach for our money, despite what wild theories are suggesting.""

Amongst the broad spectrum of India's NRI network, gulf countries continue to acquire the largest concentration, along with other countries like Singapore, the US, Canada, the UK, etc. With a plethora of NRIs moving abroad in search of better job opportunities and education, it is important to note that NRIs are taxed in India on the income generated within the country itself.

Following the steady influx of NRIs, a recent survey by SBNRI, a one-stop investment platform for NRIs and OCIs, unveiled the nuances of navigating taxes for NRIs and OCIs in 2024. In tandem, the government of India continues to work on making the process of taxation as seamless as possible for NRIs, but despite their strong efforts the taxation landscape for NRIs continues to be permeated by a series of bottlenecks.

Within the tax landscape, 14.11% NRIs from Australia followed by 13.10%, and 8.06% from the UK and US respectively consider double taxation as the biggest challenge when it comes to filing taxes as an NRI and OCI. At the same time, 12.10%, 9.05%, and 6.02% of NRIs from the US, UK, and Australia found accessing taxation documents from abroad to be the most challenging concern for filing taxes as NRIs.

Amidst the rising challenges for filing taxes as NRIs, Mudit Vijayvergiya of SBNRI, commented, ""While, the process of filing taxes for NRIs has been subjected to multiple revisions, aimed at making it more streamlined and simpler, the proliferation of tax-related issues has only grown further. Having witnessed NRIs grapple with the complex nuances of the taxation process, it's paramount to partner with experts who can guide them through this journey, mitigating any sort of disparities.""

Against the challenging taxation backdrop, the survey also unveiled that 10% of US-based NRIs, followed by 7% from Australia, Canada, and Singapore respectively report only the income earned in India to the Indian Tax Authorities. On the contrary, 6% from Canada, 4% from the US and Singapore respectively, and 3% from Australia revealed that they reported both income earned in India and abroad to the Indian Tax authorities.

While filing taxes is a plaguing issue for NRIs and OCIs, the ascent of tax-savings option is a lucrative opportunity for every NRI. Approximately, 7% of UK and Australia-based NRIs respectively, along with 5% from Canada and Singapore alike, leverage tax-savings options available to them. In contrast, only 2% from Australia, 4% from Canada and Singapore respectively, and 6% from the UK are unaware of the tax-savings options.

Navigating beyond the fragmented tax landscape for NRIs, the survey also revealed that 5% of NRIs from Singapore, 4% from the UK, and 2% from the US don't file tax returns in India. Amongst the ones that do file tax returns in India, only a fraction of them choose to do it themselves by filling out forms. While the majority, namely 12% from the UK, along with 10%, and 7% from the US and Singapore respectively hire a tax professional or advisor to do the same on their behalf.

With an increasing number of NRIs, SBNRI's survey also explored the primary reason for Indians living abroad, with 11% from the UK, and 9% from Canada, followed by others choosing to live abroad primarily for better employment opportunities. Additionally, higher education appeared to be the primary reason, with 9%, 6%, and 5% from Singapore, Canada, and UK respectively choosing the latter.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.1607843137254903,448974887,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108750299,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-48660,overlay-etnri/photo.jpg",

However, Sean Nalewanyj of realscienceathletics.com challenges this popular belief, suggesting that traditional ab routines might not be the most efficient way to sculpt your midsection.

The Problem With Traditional Abs Workouts

Ab workouts, particularly those found on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, have amassed millions of views, highlighting the widespread desire for a lean and toned abdomen.

Despite their popularity, Nalewanyj argues these routines offer more allure than actual results. The fundamental issue lies in the misconception that specific ab exercises can directly burn belly fat and reveal a chiseled six-pack. This belief persists despite the well-established fitness principle that spot reduction of fat is a myth. Fat loss occurs across the entire body through a sustained caloric deficit, not localized exercises.

The focus on short, high-repetition ab workouts misses the mark for several reasons. Firstly, the abs are just like any other muscle group and respond best to resistance training. The pursuit of a stronger, more defined core should therefore align with principles of muscle growth and hypertrophy applied to other body parts. Instead of dedicating countless minutes to ab-centric exercises, Nalewanyj recommends a more integrated approach to fitness that includes compound exercises offering indirect stimulation to the abdominal muscles.

For those looking to enhance their abdominal strength and appearance, a shift towards exercises that provide optimal hypertrophy stimulus is crucial. This means selecting a few key movements that effectively engage the abs, pushing close to failure within a typical hypertrophy rep range, and incorporating progressive overload over time. Exercise selection can vary, but should include movements that target the rectus abdominis through spinal flexion, as well as isometric exercises like planks for core stability.

Don't Treat the Abs Differently

Nalewanyj emphasizes the importance of not treating the abs differently from other muscle groups. The idea of needing high volumes of dedicated ab training is a misconception. A well-rounded fitness program that includes some direct ab work, ideally once a week, is sufficient for most people. Rep ranges can vary, but a focus on form, technique, and a mind-muscle connection is essential to ensure the abdominal muscles, rather than the hip flexors or lower back, are doing the work.

In conclusion, achieving a defined midsection is less about the quantity of ab-specific exercises and more about the quality of your overall fitness approach. It involves maintaining a healthy diet to achieve a low body fat percentage and applying solid muscle-building principles to ab training.

By reevaluating the effectiveness of traditional ab workouts and adopting a more comprehensive fitness strategy, individuals can work towards a stronger, more defined core without falling prey to the allure of quick-fix ab routines.",boxrox.com,news,boxrox.com,Robbie Wild Hudson,-0.08235294117647063,448974825,1,https://image.boxrox.com/2022/11/No-to-Sit-Ups.jpg,

West Fargo Commissioner Roben Anderson said he was not proposing Monday, March 18, to discuss the merits of the program that is automatically renewed in West Fargo but rather to create a motion that requires the commission to reconsider the abatement program and have a discussion of it.

The abatement program gives buyers of new homes a two-year property tax break. The program is automatically renewed and has been since it was implemented in 2008.

""In addition to the many comments we've had from taxpayers and the discussions we've had, the commission is an entirely different commission, and the city is different than it was 16 years ago,"" Anderson said. ""In my opinion, the commission should be reviewing these abatements and other incentives regularly.""

Anderson said Monday the discussion was not about whether the exemption should exist or not, but if it should be automatically renewed each year without review or commission discussion.

""This is ongoing; we don't ever address it, haven't been addressing it since 2008,"" Mayor Bernie Dardis said. ""The purpose of this would be to prove there is a renewal process and discussion by the commission.""

Anderson said that based on rough estimates, about $238,000 in West Fargo tax dollars were not collected in 2023 due to the abatement program. The total taxes not collected by Cass County, the West Fargo School District and West Fargo Parks was just under $900,000 in 2023.

Anderson said an annual renewal process to the abatement program could be worked into the budgeting process so that it is not forgotten at any year.

""The commission should be discussing this exemption and other things regularly,"" Anderson said.

The program is similar to the one in Horace, which caused strife among Horace city leaders after the Horace City Council voted to suspend the program for 6 months in January 2023 but then reversed the decision in June and brought the program back.

""We need to be very careful in reference to other communities that we stay competitive with them,"" Commissioner Mark Simmons said. ""That is my biggest concern, that we stay competitive with them.""

""The renewal would allow the commission to discuss and evaluate the exemption based on economic conditions, growth strategies, what neighboring cities are doing,"" Anderson said.

The proposal failed by a 3-2 vote. Anderson and Commissioner Mandy George voted in favor of the discussions while Dardis, Simmons and Commissioner Brad Olson voted no.",inforum.com,news,INFORUM,,0.08235294117647052,448974779,1,https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/c3c181b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F52%2F676834034a5a990f069b497d0c58%2F111622.N.WF.Logo.06.jpg,

When you move into a place with roommates or start to live with family again, you have a choice as to how you want to approach your groceries.

You and the people you live with could all share your groceries and split the bill; you could share only basic items like bread, milk, and eggs, or you could not share any food at all, and each person has to fend for themselves.

One woman recently moved in with her boyfriend's family and has been contributing to their grocery bills but feels as though she doesn't get to eat as much as she should due to his brother's big appetite.

She and her boyfriend, John, are in their early 30s and working while they're in graduate school. Because they're both students and on tight budgets, she and John decided to live with John's family, which includes his mom and 19-year-old brother, Luke.

She's been living with John's family for eight months and sends rent money to his mom. Luke doesn't work or have a driver's license, so he spends most of his days at home, doing whatever he wants.

Luke also works out a lot, which means he has quite an appetite and eats a lot of food in the house. However, that's begun to bother her as she and John share groceries with his family.

""Everything is fair game, including whatever food John and I buy,"" she said.

""While we will split the Costco bill with his mom, I still feel like we're spending more money on food since it feels like we aren't feeding only ourselves. It feels like I'm spending so much money on food that I'm not able to enjoy [and] I'm not responsible for feeding Luke.""

She thinks she could subtly solve this issue by buying labels and putting them on food she buys for herself so no one touches it. However, John believes it would be better if she spoke up and asked his family to save some more food for her.

And that's especially true when it comes to sales tax.

In all, 45 states and the District of Columbia assess sales taxes on most purchases. There are, of course, exceptions -- and those vary from state to state, too.

Confusing, isn't it? GOBankingRates turned to the Tax Foundation for answers about state tax rates to find out where you'll pay the highest amount on your purchases. Keep reading to see why that list isn't exactly what it seems.

Five states do not assess a statewide sales tax, and they run from coast to coast. If you live in Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire or Oregon, you won't pay a state tax on your purchases.

Among the states that assess a retail tax, Colorado's rate is the lowest at 2.9%, per the Tax Foundation, meaning you'll pay $2.90 in state tax for every $100 you spend.

So, in which states can residents expect to pay the highest state taxes on retail purchases? These are the top 10 -- plus one more for a tie -- and they come with a caveat:

So what's the caveat? State taxes don't represent the only retail taxes assessed. In 38 states, local sales and use taxes are allowed to be assessed by counties and municipalities and added to the state tax, according to the Tax Foundation. And depending on where you're spending your money, the local taxes could equal or exceed the state tax.

In Albany County, New York, for example, the state rate of 4% is compounded by a 4% local tax. In Seattle, Washington, effective April 1, shoppers will have to figure in a local rate of 3.85% on top of a state rate of 6.5% for a total of 10.35%. That means a $100 purchase in Albany will total $108. In Seattle, prepare to pay $110.35 for that same $100.

And in Colorado, that low state tax rate of 2.9% isn't all you'll pay when you buy something. Colorado allows local governments to charge a sales and use tax that averages 4.907%, the Tax Foundation reports.

Even in Alaska, which doesn't charge a statewide tax, local taxes come into play. Alaska law allows for a local tax that averages 1.821 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. With that rate, Alaskans would pay $1.821 in retail taxes on every $100 purchase, adding $1.82 to a $100 total at checkout.

The five states that have the highest average combined local and state taxes, per the Tax Foundation, are:

If you plan to spend money on vacation or in an unfamiliar spot, it helps to check out the sales tax first to prevent sticker shock, especially if you're from a no-sales-tax state. Specific information for cities, towns and counties usually is available on the website of state taxation departments.

Critics say it is an unauthorized expansion of the EPA's regulatory authority. But proponents said it's important to control pollution from methane emissions.

Led by the attorneys general of Texas and Oklahoma, 26 states are suing the EPA over a final rule published March 8 that, in part, sets new regulations for existing methane infrastructure.

Twenty other states, including Colorado and the District of Columbia, filed a motion to intervene in the case in support of the new federal regulation Tuesday.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the new rule must be defended in a Monday news release announcing the state's intervention in the Texas case.

""These protections must remain in place at the federal level for effective oversight of methane emissions from surrounding states; that's why we are committed to defending the federal methane rule,"" Weiser said in the release.

""I'm not sure really why Colorado needs to weigh in on this particular EPA rule, since Colorado already had strict methane rules without it,"" said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance. ""Perhaps the state senses vulnerability to all the overregulation of the Biden administration or just wants a hand in ensuring that other states' equally hamstring their oil and natural gas industries.""

""Companies have reduced methane emissions significantly over the last several years, but regulators like to take credit for that with yet more regulation,"" Sgamma said.

Texas believes the EPA is regulating outside of its statutory authority.

""The EPA is once again trying to seize regulatory authority that Congress has not granted,"" said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in an online letter. ""I am challenging this blatant overreach by the Biden Administration and will continue to defend vital sectors of the Texas economy.""

The new rule from the EPA regulates methane emissions from both new sources and existing infrastructure, something the EPA has never done before. This raises the question of whether the EPA has legal authority to expand its statutory mandate without asking Congress for permission.

The ""major questions"" doctrine states that federal agencies must have explicit permission to newly regulate politically and economically significant issues, rather than assuming they have unbridled regulatory authority.

In 2022, EPA passed a rule that critics said expanded its regulatory authority over coal-fired powerplants to apply to all such plants, nationwide, rather than its customary statutory authority to make regulations for specific plants.

Critics said at the time that regulation would have effectively shut all coal plants down at once by imposing unachievable emissions limits.

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down that regulation, stating EPA's statutory authority was limited to making regulations applying to a specific plant regarding what technology was available and capable of reducing emissions and how the plant operators would have to comply with EPA standards.

In trying to apply one set of regulations to all coal-fired power plants in a way that would force them to close, the court said the EPA had improperly attempted to shift generation away from coal plants nationwide, and that the agency had to get explicit authority from Congress due to the enormous nationwide fiscal impacts it would cause.

The major questions doctrine is being raised here as well, given the fact that EPA has never regulated existing infrastructure in this way, Paxton said.

""EPA's new rule establishes onerous emissions standards for the oil and gas industry that would require producers to drastically update infrastructure,"" said Paxton in a March 8 press release.

Paxton said the new rule usurps the role of the states in establishing emissions standards for existing sources and forces them to adopt nationwide EPA standards.

Before now, the EPA deferred to state agencies to set pollution standards for existing infrastructure, as Colorado has done in the past few years.

The Biden administration rolled out the new regulation to coincide with climate talks in Dubai in December, but didn't publish the rule in the Federal Register until Friday -- an unusually long delay between an announcement and a required publication.

""This federal regulation simply applies paperwork differently than what CDPHE is already doing with little to no additional environmental benefit,"" said Dan Haley, president and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association. ""We're not sure why the AG's office would get involved in a suit that will only further burden a state agency that's already drowning in unnecessary legislative mandates and bureaucratic red tape.""

Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School told The Denver Gazette that the EPA often looks to states or industries for best practices to build on existing regulations.

Jenks confirmed a December statement she made to Politico suggesting that regulations in Colorado and New Mexico were ""used to guide the federal regulations.""

""I'm sure I said something like that, but I think I would back it up to say I think EPA is always looking to states or even companies in the industry, that they're regulating for best practices. (EPA does so) because then there are tested regulatory structures that they can take lessons learned from and build on those existing regulations because it can help mitigate opposition where another entity might say it's too costly or not feasible,"" Jenks said. ""If EPA can look to a state like Colorado or New Mexico or some operators that are already doing something, they can say, 'no, this is feasible because it's being done.' So, I think that was the context of my quote.""

When asked about the potential burden on oil and gas production companies, Jenks said that the question should be whether the EPA has the legal authority to require these controls. She believes the EPA does have this authority.

Jeremy Nichols, senior advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity Environmental Health Program told The Denver Gazette in a statement Thursday: ""We're pleased to see Colorado standing up to the oil and gas industry's attacks on clean air and the climate.""",gazette.com,news,Colorado Springs Gazette,Scott Weiser,0.08235294117647052,448974536,1,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/4f/34f6bdd0-716c-5978-a38d-d4bf8a6ff850/65fcbc231e99d.image.jpg?crop=1050%2C551%2C118%2C78&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,eng-9418288

In a report released this week, the United Nations International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said some 56 million tonnes of ""e-waste"" was generated in 2022 - enough to fill tractor-trailers that could be lined up bumper to bumper around the globe.

That amount is on track to reach more than 70 million tonnes by 2030.

E-waste is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery such as mobile phones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels.

It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.

According to the report, metals - including copper, gold and iron - make up half of the 60 million tonnes, worth a total of over €80 billion.

Plastics accounted for over 15 million tonnes and the remaining 12 million tonnes included substances such as composite materials and glass.

The United Nations says 22 percent of e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022.

However, that figure is expected to fall to 20 percent by the end of the decade because of ""staggering growth"" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product lifecycles, the growing ""electronification"" of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure.

That amount is on track to reach more than 70 million tonnes by 2030.

E-waste is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery such as mobile phones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels.

According to the report, metals - including copper, gold and iron - make up half of the 60 million tonnes, worth a total of over €80 billion.

The United Nations says 22 percent of e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022.

A tax expert discussed deductions and credits taxpayers can file to get the most money back on their tax returns.

To help you with your taxes, The U.S. Sun interviewed a certified public accountant, or CPA, to offer practical tips for optimizing your tax return.

Ali spoke with The U.S. Sun to provide helpful information for those looking to get the most money back on their tax return.

Ali first went into the various key deductions and credits to keep in mind when filing your taxes, which are due April 15 this year.

Depending on which credits you are eligible for, you can claim from $600 to $15,950.

Ali explained how, instead of claiming the standard deduction, you can claim itemized deductions if you qualify for them and they exceed the standard deduction amount.

For those who are self-employed, they can deduct business expenses such as home office expenses, supplies, and travel.

3. Student Loan Interest Deduction

The CPA noted that up to $2,500 of a student's student loan interest can be deducted if their income is below a certain level.

4. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

This credit is a refundable credit for low to moderate-income working individuals and families, especially those with children.

Another key credit that Ali noted was the CTC credit which taxpayers can claim for each qualifying child they have under the age of 17.

The credit amount varies up to $2,000, and a portion may be refundable as the additional child tax credit.

6. American Opportunity Credit (AOC) & Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)

The AOC credit is up to $2,500 for qualified education expenses paid for by an eligible student.

It applies to the first four years of post-secondary education and is partly refundable.

On the other hand, the LLC credit is up to $2,000 and is nonrefundable.

It can be used for undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree courses.

7. Child and Dependent Care Credit

Ali explained that this credit is for expenses paid for the care of qualifying dependents to permit you to work or actively look for work.

The credit is $600 to $1,050 per child, up to a max of two children.

8. Adoption Credit

Another noteworthy credit is the adoption credit, which is a nonrefundable credit for qualified adoption expenses up to $15,950.

9. Residential Clean Energy Credit

This tax credit is for homeowners who purchased solar panels for their homes.

The credit is 30% of the cost of the solar panel installation, up to $2,000.

Next, Ali delved into various tax credits and deductions that taxpayers often overlook.

He noted that many people miss out on this tax credit and forget about the 1098T form that they get from their educational institution.

Using this form, eligible students can claim credits such as the AOC and LLC, as well as the Student Loan Interest Deduction.

The deduction provides eligible taxpayers with up to $2,500 of the interest paid on qualified student loans during the tax year.

2. Energy Efficient Tax Credits

The Residential Clean Energy Credit is not the only energy-efficient tax credit that homeowners can claim.

Ali explained that there are tax credits for home upgrades, such as for heat pumps, windows, doors, and gas water heaters.

3. Home Office Deduction

One of the business expenses that self-employed taxpayers can deduct is for their home office.

The cost of a workspace you use regularly and only for your business can be deducted, regardless of whether you rent or own it.

4. Business Use of Vehicle Deduction

Another business expense that self-employed taxpayers can deduct regards expenses for their vehicle, such as fuel, maintenance, repairs, and insurance.

The deductions must be related to vehicle use for business purposes.

Ali next outlined a few steps that taxpayers can take to maximize the money they save on their tax returns.

1. Contribute to an IRA

He noted that taxpayers can contribute to an IRA, up to $6,000.

Doing so can maximize tax savings by reducing your taxable income for the year and allowing your contributions to grow tax-deferred until retirement.

Additionally, contributing to an IRA can make you eligible for certain tax credits or deductions.

2. Purchase a Home

If a taxpayer purchases a home, they can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes via itemized deductions.

3. Maximize 401k Contributions

Ali also suggested maximizing tax returns by increasing the amount of money you contribute to your 401k through your job.

Contributing to your 401k with pre-tax dollars means that you decrease your taxable income, resulting in a lower overall tax liability.

At a young age, I witnessed my father dying in pain from lung cancer and suffering terribly. More recently, my mom contracted pancreatic cancer, and I had her medical power of attorney.

A couple of weeks before she passed, I was sitting on the edge of her bed. She grabbed my arm and begged me to make sure her health care providers didn't do any medical interventions to keep her alive, like resuscitation, that would prolong her suffering.

This nightmare experience seared this unforgettable thought into my head: No one should have to die with that much pain.

That is why I am the proud lead sponsor of the End-of-Life Options for Terminally Ill Patients Act. I recently introduced this legislation that would allow medical aid in dying as an end-of-life care option for mentally capable, terminally ill adults in Illinois, with six months or less to live, to gently end unbearable suffering. It is 100% voluntary for terminally ill people, physicians and pharmacists.

More than 7 of 10 Illinois likely voters (71%) support passing medical aid-in-dying legislation, according to a 2023 Impact Research poll. This majority support spans the demographic, political, racial and religious spectrums, including 73% of voters with a disability, 83% of Latino voters, 69% of Catholic voters and half of Republican voters. In contrast, fewer than 1 in 5 Illinois voters (17%) oppose medical aid in dying.

The Illinois bill is modeled on medical aid in dying in 10 other states and Washington, D.C. Oregon first implemented this medical practice more than 25 years ago.

Our bill has more than a dozen requirements to prevent abuse and coercion, especially of vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities. The legislation's safeguards are especially important to me since I have lived with a disability for 35 years: multiple sclerosis.

I care deeply that our health care systems and insurance companies do not discriminate against people with disabilities or who can otherwise be discounted. This legislation ensures there would be no abuse or coercion by physicians, family members or other interested parties.

These multiple safeguards explain why 6 out of 10 Illinois physicians (62%) personally would want the option of medical aid in dying if they become terminally ill, while only one 1 of 5 (20%) would not want it, according to a 2021 Medscape/WedMD poll. There is ample proof these safeguards work.

In fact, there has not been one substantiated case of abuse or coercion in the 25 years since medical aid in dying first became available in Oregon. The Illinois State Medical Society dropped its opposition to medical aid in dying last year.

A 2019 University of Pittsburgh School of Law report concluded the experience in the numerous states and Washington, D.C., where medical aid in dying is allowed, ""puts to rest most of the arguments that opponents of authorization [of medical aid in dying] have made -- or at least those that can be settled by empirical data. The most relevant data -- namely, those relating to the traditional and more contemporary concerns that opponents of legalization have expressed -- do not support and, in fact, dispel the concerns of opponents.""

Medical aid-in-dying legislation has led to improvements in hospice care in California, Oregon and Hawaii. The use of hospice services has increased in those states. Research shows the vast majority of people who opt for medical aid in dying are already enrolled in hospice. They decide to stop treating their disease because it is incurable.

I only wish my mother and father had the option of medical aid in dying so they didn't have to suffer needlessly when death was already at their doorstep. To honor their memory, I want to ensure all Illinoisans have the option to decide for themselves when they have suffered enough at the end of life so they can die peacefully, at home, surrounded by their loved ones.

For these reasons, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this compassionate legislation.

That amount is on track to reach more than 70 million tonnes by 2030.

E-waste is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery such as mobile phones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels.

It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.

According to the report, metals - including copper, gold and iron - make up half of the 60 million tonnes, worth a total of over €80 billion.

Plastics accounted for over 15 million tonnes and the remaining 12 million tonnes included substances such as composite materials and glass.

However, that figure is expected to fall to 20 percent by the end of the decade because of ""staggering growth"" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product lifecycles, the growing ""electronification"" of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure.

It says some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements such as mercury, as well as rare metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers.

Only 1 percent of the demand for the 17 minerals that make up the rare metals is met through recycling.

To date, about half of all e-waste is generated in Asia, where few countries have laws on recycling or collection targets.

Recycling and collection rates top 40 percent in Europe, where per-capita waste generation is highest at nearly 18 kilos.

In Africa, which generates the least of any of the five big global regions, recycling and collection rates hover at about 1 percent.

""The latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow,"" said Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, head of the ITU telecommunication development bureau.

""With less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling.""

For some, e-waste represents a way to earn cash by rummaging through trash in the developing world to find coveted commodities, despite the health risks.

At the Dandora dumpsite where garbage collected from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi ends up - even though a court declared it full over a generation ago - scavengers try to earn a living by picking through rubbish for e-waste that can be sold to businesses as recycled material.

Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.

""When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health,"" he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he ""can't come to work because of chest problems.""

However Okoth said they don't have any other options. ""We are now used to the smoke because if you don't go to work you will not eat.""

The authors of the UN report have acknowledged that many people in the developing world pay their bills through harvesting such e-waste, and called for them to be trained and equipped to make such work safer.

The Regional District of Central Okanagan says it needs more time in order to comply with government legislation that would allow secondary suites or accessory dwelling units in all electoral areas.

Staff say they will not be able to meet the June 30 deadline to adopt the necessary bylaw amendments and are preparing an application to the Ministry of Housing seeking an 18-month extension to the end of December, 2025.

""Due to infrastructure and servicing limitations in the electoral areas, without robust policies and regulations, additional density may increase risks to public health, safety or the environment,"" a staff report suggests.

""Proposed bylaw amendments and associated analysis will require considerable staff resources.

""Our ability to meet the legislation compliance deadline is further limited by ongoing commitments to support residents effected by the White Rock Lake and McDougall Creek wildfires.""

Staff are asking the regional board to support its application for an extension.

Density could double

The provincial legislation would bring with it the prospect of residential density doubling within the two electoral areas.

Additionally, with approximately 25 per cent of lots within the electoral areas vacant according to BC Assessment data, a full build out could result in a 166 per cent increase in residential units.

The RDCO says it maintains a ""high degree of oversight"" on all development in those areas to ensure they are adequately serviced and align with community context.

Staff says considerable analysis is needed to determine whether current standards for onsite wastewater disposal are sufficient to manage the cumulative impact of greater density.

Current rural infrastructure and servicing standards and the RDCO's own regulatory framework may also not be sufficient for the potential density increase.

""A detailed review is needed to determine whether densification could exacerbate risks to public health, safety or the environment.""

Councillors say they have created a budget that will protect its extensive calendar of free events, award-winning environmental services and public safety programmes, despite facing budget cuts of over £111,500 over the next three years.

The move comes as the council faces an additional yearly bill of over £100,000 after being handed responsibility for almost 1,400 allotments (29 sites) by Durham County Council, without any additional financial support.

However, the council says it is committed to delivering the best for Stanley's communities, despite the steep rise in financial pressures, as it strives to deliver more for less.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

If a foreign player's contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, Japanese authorities classify them as non-residents and they pay less tax than residents, reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members and was on a multi-year contract, AFP reported.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said in the statement, obtained by AFP on Sunday.

Iniesta has now paid the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued recommendations to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to conduct an in-depth evaluation of its current tax incentive regimes.

The goal is to identify and eliminate redundant or unnecessary incentives while suggesting the adoption of more efficient tax measures, such as accelerated depreciation for necessary incentives.

This advice aims to simplify the tax system, broaden the tax base, and lower overall tax rates.

According to reports from Business Recorder, the IMF highlighted the recent amendments in the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), which, despite removing certain tax incentives, introduced new ones.

Notably, the Finance Act, 2023, introduced Section 44A in the ITO, offering tax exemptions and concessionary treatments for incomes derived from qualified investments under the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act, 2022.

This includes income for investors, shareholders, their associates, and specified companies, along with third-party lenders.

Furthermore, the IMF suggests reevaluating the current classical system of taxation, which taxes corporate profits and dividend distributions, thereby resulting in the double taxation of corporate income.

The district's proposed $45.5 million budget keeps taxes flat and would not take advantage of one of the highest state Act 1 indexes in years -- 8%. The inflation-based index is the percentage the district is allowed to raise taxes without seeking voter approval in a referendum.

The district is expecting its property tax revenue for next school year to increase by about $306,000. That's because of a $3.5 million increase in the district's assessed property value, from $123.4 million to $126.9 million, according to a presentation by business manager Jeff McVey.

The district expects revenue from real estate taxes to increase by 3.2%, from $9.3 million projected in the current school year's budget to $9.6 million in next school year's budget. That assumes a tax collection rate of 89%.

Total local revenue would increase by 2.3%, from about $13 million to $13.3 million, which also includes earned income, per capita, real estate and local services taxes; delinquent tax collection; local grant programs; and miscellaneous revenue and fees.

As proposed, the district's property tax rate would remain at 97.64 mills. It was last increased by about 1.6%, from 96.14 mills to 97.64 mills, for the current school year.

School board President Tim Beckes said budget discussions will continue. The board must approve a proposed final budget by the end of May and the final budget by the end of June.

""The board continues to work hard to put the district into a position that allows us to reinvest back into the schools and students, support programs and facilities improvements,"" Beckes said. ""All of this is done with a goal of improving our students' experience and academic outcomes.""

While New Kensington Mayor Tom Guzzo frequently touts the city's revitalization -- from new small retail businesses along its Fifth Avenue corridor to industrial operations in the manufacturing park spanning the city and Arnold -- he placed credit for the district's finances with the school board ""being very diligent and looking at all responsible cost-saving measures in their budget planning.""

""I am certainly hopeful that the expansion of our tax base with the addition of all of the new businesses in our continued revitalization is playing a role, as that is one of the desired outcomes.""

In addition to more local tax revenue without a tax increase, the proposed 2024-25 budget also includes a nearly $713,000 surplus. It projects total revenue of $46.2 million while spending $45.5 million.

That would increase the district's fund balance to about $6.1 million. The district has shown surpluses its last four school years; the last deficit, about $270,000, was in 2019-20.

The district's total projected revenue and spending are each down by about 10% over the current school year, largely because of the end of covid-related federal funding.

The budget shows the district's state revenue increasing 6.2%, from $28.7 million to $30.5 million. Federal funding will fall by about 75%, from $9.8 million to $2.4 million, due mostly to the end of covid-19 pandemic recovery funding.

Let's talk about something that might not sound too thrilling at first glance but touches every aspect of how our government spends our tax dollars: legislative fiscal notes. Yeah, I know, it sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry, but stick with me - it's actually pretty important stuff.

Now, I'm no financial wizard, but even I know to check the bill before tapping my credit card. The same goes for our state government. Before they spend on new programs or cut taxes, they must have a clear picture of the financial impact.

Enter the fiscal note -- a cost estimate attached to every bill the Legislature considers. These notes help ensure responsible budgeting and informed decision-making. And Hawaii is the only state that doesn't mandate them at all.

The most recent comprehensive report on state fiscal note practices dates to 2015. Then, 38 states and the District of Columbia prepared notes for nearly all bills. Every other state requires fiscal notes for at least some legislation. California, for example, requires a fiscal impact statement for ballot initiatives submitted to voters.

In its 2015 report, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities listed five best practices for fiscal notes: prepare notes for all proposals, employ nonpartisan staff to conduct the analysis, project fiscal impacts for four or more years, revise fiscal notes throughout the legislative process, and make each note available online.

Bills proposing implementing some version of these practices in Hawaii's legislative process have been a staple in Republican packages, at least since I was elected in 2013 and signed one. This year, Rep. Gene Ward is the only Republican to sign on to one.

Curiously, it's a proposal led by progressive Democratic Rep. Natalia Hussey-Burdick, one of Ward's ideological polar opposites. Fiscal transparency appears to be one of those rare moments when conservatives and progressives can agree.

Of the proposal, Hussey-Burdick wrote via text, ""Understanding the potential fiscal impacts of each bill is an essential element of doing the people's work. We shouldn't have to rely on speculation from special interest groups in testimony, we need an independent state agency to provide unbiased input.""

Like Hussey-Burdick, Ward also highlighted the need for transparency and greater independence. But, for Ward, fiscal notes would provide independence from other legislators.

""Bottom line: having fiscal notes would dilute the centralized power wielded by just a few Democratic leaders,"" Ward texted.

The current set-up, he said, ""allows for complete control of the outcome of the Session by the Speaker and his Majority's top leaders.""

At worst, Ward is correct, and the state doesn't have fiscal notes because it's not in the majority leadership's best interest. But, before we jump to the worst-case scenario, there are other possibilities.

Most notes are still best guesses. Despite their importance, accurately estimating the costs of proposed policies can be challenging. Factors such as uncertainty in economic conditions, behavioral responses to policy changes, and evolving programmatic details can complicate cost estimation efforts.

Producing fiscal notes would require a significant investment. Ironically, we don't actually know how much it would cost because both the House fiscal note bill and its Senate companion didn't include any dollar amounts. Yet, we can guess that the cost of setting up a new research office could be in the same ballpark as the cost of the Legislative Reference Bureau, which received $4.2 million for operations and expenses this year.

Controversially, I'd also add that creating a whole new office to produce fiscal notes is somewhat duplicative of existing efforts.

In February, the Senate Government Operations Committee heard the companion to Hussey-Burdick's bill. Of the four pieces of testimony the committee received, three individuals expressed their support, while the Department of Budget and Finance offered brief comments and pointed out that ""currently, the Senate Committee on Ways and Means and House Committee on Finance share similar responsibilities and duties as proposed by this measure.""

I think that's a point we often miss when advocating for fiscal notes. Legislators are required to pass a balanced budget, and they can't do that if they're blind to a bill's cost when it reaches the final stages of the legislative process. Sitting through budget negotiations with Ways and Means Chair Donovan Dela Cruz and then-Finance Chair Sylvia Luke, I can confidently say they had a good grip on the fiscal impacts of their committee's decisions and could explain them to me whenever I asked.

This expertise is evident in the 83-slide PowerPoint Sen. Dela Cruz produced for senators last year describing budget changes, the impact of major bills, and how the Legislature's decisions change the state's overall financial outlook.

According to Dela Cruz, he's been making these PowerPoints since his first session as the Senate Ways and Means Chair in 2018. ""Members didn't like voting on it (the state budget) without knowing the full financial plan,"" he explained in a recent interview. ""So I started doing a full presentation on the big bills that we need to pass, the budget, and the Senate position's impact on the financial plan. Now, that's all done before we vote in committee.""

For most bills, Dela Cruz said his committee often asks departments to provide fiscal information before they hear a bill and tries to add appropriation amounts to committee reports whenever they're not included in the legislation itself.

As someone who remembers former budget chairs who silently crossed bill numbers out with Sharpies on a giant easel pad to let the public know that a bill just died in a mysterious backroom, I do think the process has improved over time. That said, more needs to be done.

But, since the quest for fiscal notes has been languishing for over three decades, we need to try something different. An independent, nonpartisan office dedicated specifically to producing fiscal analyses for each bill the Legislature considers might be the gold standard, but it's a heavy lift. While I know it's an unpopular strategy in today's political environment, I think we need to take an incremental approach.

To start, the Legislature should adjust its internal rules to require some of the best practices that some chairs already employ. For example, chairs could be required to include an approximate fiscal impact, including appropriation amounts or estimated changes to state revenues, in any committee report that accompanies a third-reading bill.

In California, rulemaking agencies are required to fill out an economic and fiscal impact statement in a standardized format that identifies potential private sector impacts and costs to local governments using checkboxes. The Legislature could require committees to use a similar form for each bill that's scheduled for a hearing in its final committee. If a sponsor or chair doesn't know the exact numbers, they can fill out what they do know, and at least, the public will know what level of information legislators are working with.

And, since I suspect a lack of staff resources is the primary reason we don't get more of this information on a regular basis, both money committees need funds to hire additional permanent staff with expertise in economic forecasting. Legislators could also consider creating more positions in the five research agencies that currently exist. Adding staff to an existing agency is usually much more cost-effective than creating a new one. Plus, if the committees and agencies are already doing some of that work, it makes more sense to focus on improving the current system before we try to take the whole thing apart.

All that said, I know these changes aren't everything. Internal rules aren't laws, and legislators can always waive them.

But it's a beginning that we need. If the Legislature adopts new rules that urge chairs to make fiscal impact analyses more consistent and public, it can help build the case for bigger changes.",civilbeat.org,news,Honolulu Civil Beat,Beth Fukumoto,0.2313725490196079,448972243,1,https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2023/03/05102404/8DD93905-D094-4DD5-9EC1-C06D32577479.jpeg,

No single county, village or estate can boast of being garbage-free.

For the residents of Kitere in Migori County, garbage is a huge menace. Residents complain of strong odours from various accumulations of garbage that attract pests like rats, cockroaches and flies.

The pests are carriers of diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery. Garbage is therefore a threat to the lives of these residents who are concerned that no action has ever been put in place to contain it.

Grated, some residents are negligent and lack knowledge about the proper disposal of home waste. For example, garbage piles often conceal sharp objects and broken glasses that can cause injuries and infections or even more severe harm. Improper disposal of other types of garbage such as plastics can block drainage systems and waterways, leading to flooding.

According to the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), improper disposal of garbage can also contribute to climate change. This happens when the decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas. Burning garbage in open areas also releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causing global warming.

Improper disposal of waste also has an impact on the economy because the management and cleanup of such garbage require significant financial resources. Governments have to allocate funds for waste collection, treatment, and disposal. Improper disposal of garbage also causes habitat destruction. When garbage is irresponsibly dumped in natural habitats or water bodies, it destroys the natural ecosystem. Marine life can be affected by ingesting or getting entangled in plastic waste, leading to deaths.

Let us all dispose of our waste properly to avoid random accumulations of garbage. However, the government must also provide public disposal facilities and punish those who dispose of their garbage carelessly.

A hearing was set in Saraos' case for July 26, 2023, but process servers were unable to find Slone to serve her with the court summons.

Hilo District Judge Kanani Laubach set a second hearing for Aug. 23, 2023. Slone again was a no-show for the proceedings, and Saraos told the judge, according to court records, that she didn't want to pursue the matter further.

Laubach dismissed the case without prejudice and waived the filing fee for the small claims case, should Saraos decide to refile the complaint.

The extraction of coal produces large volumes of waste rock (WR) that are sometimes sulphide rich (principally containing iron sulphides such as pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS)), with varying quantities of trace elements such as As, Si, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo and Cr etc). Such waste is environmentally sensitive due to the risk of oxidation in presence of atmospheric oxygen and water. Sulphide oxidation may result in acidic waters (acid mine drainage, AMD), which often contains high loads of dissolved metals. Coal combustion results in large amounts of fly ash (FA), which also is of environmental concern. However, FA is alkaline and may potentially be used for neutralisation of AMD. Therefore, the AMD producing potential of WR from coal mining and the neutralisation potential of FAs from coal and biomass combustion was studied with the ultimate goal to develop a methodology to decrease the environmental problems related to these materials.WR was sampled form the Lakhra coal field in Pakistan, which has an estimated coal reserve of 1.3 Bton, from lignite to sub-bituminous in quality. The WR samples were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods and the acid producing potential was determined by static (Acid Base Accounting) and kinetic (modified humidity cells test) methods. Besides organic material, the WRs are composed of quartz, pyrite, kaolinite, hematite and gypsum with varying amounts of calcite, lime, malladerite, spangolite, franklinite and birnessite. The Lakhra WR has strong potential to generate AMD (-70 to -492 kg CaCO3/ton) and pollute natural waters by leaching of elements such as Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and SO42-. Three different FAs based on the origin, fuel type and storage methods were studied. They were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods, the leachability was studied by batch leaching tests and the potential for buffering acids and neutralisation of AMD was quantified. Fly ash from burning i) brown coal (lignite) in Pakistan (PK), ii) black (bituminous) coal from Finland (FI) and iii) biomass FA provided by a sulphate pulp and paper mill in Sweden (SE) were studied. All ashes contained quarts, PK also iron oxide, anhydrite, and magnesioferrite, FI also mullite and lime, and SE also calcite and anorthite. All ashes were enriched in As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn compared to continental crust, and all ashes had a strong neutralisation potential, the bioash, SE, in particular. The results are encouraging and suggest that it is possible to use FA to mitigate the environmental problems with coal mine WR. Methods for that will be the focus for the continued research.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,-0.1058823529411764,448971191,1,,

Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.

""When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health,"" he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he ""can't come to work because of chest problems.""

However, Okoth said they don't have any other options: ""We are now used to the smoke because if you don't go to work you will not eat.""

Recycling plants, like Nairobi's WEEE center, have collection points across Kenya, where people can safely get rid of old electric equipment.

""We take inventory of the items,"" said Catherine Wasolia, WEEE's chief operating officer, to check for data on submitted devices and wipe them clean. Then they test each to assess if ""it can be reused or repurposed.""

E-waste expert George Masila worries about the impact of electronic waste on soil.

""When you have all this e-waste -- either in the dumpsites or mercilessly deposited anywhere else -- it could have major effects on the soil,"" Masila said. ""Every year it rains and water flows and attracts all these elements that are deposited into the environment. You have water getting contaminated.""

He said greater recycling and re-use of such materials, ""are some of the things we should be considering.""

Report authors acknowledged that many people in the developing world pay their bills through harvesting such e-waste, and called for them to be trained and equipped to make such work safer.

Like other Silicon Valley giants retrenching amid financial uncertainty, Google has cut thousands of jobs since January 2023. But the company is also accelerating changes within its lavish corporate cafeterias that will both reduce costs and cut the company's food waste.

From offering smaller milk containers to cooking eggs on the spot instead of in advance, Google has found ways to put less food in the trash while trying to make sure employees don't feel cheated out of one of the company's most beloved perks.

Google's food waste goals are set on a 2025 timeline, which is tighter than the 2030 deadlines tied to many of its other sustainability efforts. The company said in March 2022 that it aimed to cut waste per employee by half and send zero food waste to landfills by 2025. By the end of 2022, it had already diverted 85 percent of waste. ""The near-term nature of it makes it challenging,"" said Kate Brandt, Google's chief sustainability officer. The company hasn't released more recent numbers but Brandt said they are ""seeing good progress.""

Serving more than 240,000 meals a day, the 386 cafes that make up Google's global food service operations outnumber the world's approximately 360 Cheesecake Factory Inc. locations. Google also operates more than 1,500 microkitchens and 49 food trucks for employees. At this scale, the tech giant is essentially running a restaurant company. That means its experiments offer clues for how other food service companies could approach efforts to trim carbon footprints or slash costs.",columbian.com,news,The Columbian,,-0.1058823529411764,448970827,1,https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/0323_fea_FOOD-GOOGLE-WASTE-GET.jpg,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

That is due to limitations on movement for people living ""perfectly legally"" on either side of the Irish border under Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangements.

The Common Travel Area, which predates either the UK or Ireland joining the EU, means British and Irish citizens can move freely and enjoy certain rights in either jurisdiction - allowing for cross-border services such as healthcare.

But for some people living in Ireland who aren't either Irish or British citizens there is an ""invisible hard border"" that means they need to go through ""often onerous visa processes"" to make even a short, local journey across the border in Ireland.

The Committee for the Administration of Justice (CAJ) say this includes the ""majority of the members of migrant communities in the border counties"", people referred to as ""visa nationals"" who are not British, Irish or EU/EEA citizens.

In a briefing document prepared for the Derry-based North West Migrants Forum charity, the CAJ explain: ""There is an invisible hard border for persons who do require prior permission to enter the UK or RoI (visa nationals), and who therefore need to pass often onerous visa processes even for a short local journey across the land border.

""The majority of the members of migrant communities in the border counties (who are not British, Irish or EU/EEA citizens) would be visa nationals.""

While the North West Migrants Forum has been campaigning for reform of the Common Travel Area arrangements more generally, the charity's director Lilian Seenoi-Barr has now warned that the rules could exclude people from cross-border health schemes - that workers from overseas are helping to fund through the taxes they pay.

""Limitations on movement as a result of the Common Travel Area (CTA) create multiple barriers for sections of society living perfectly legally on the island of Ireland,"" she said.

""But none so grave as not having cross-border access to important medical services such as the North West Cancer at Altnagelvin or the paediatric cardiac services based in Dublin.

""For example, because of exclusions thrown up by the CTA a refugee child with a heart condition in Northern Ireland may be unable to access urgent care or be accompanied by immediate family members without first obtaining a visa. This is despite them already being granted the right to live and work on this island.""

She continued: ""Just this month Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed that since 2017 a total of 1,353 oncology patients from the Republic of Ireland have received radiotherapy treatment at Altnagelvin's North West Cancer Centre.

""It is heartening to learn that hundreds of lives are being saved because of such cross-border collaboration. But it is also disappointing that certain categories of permanent residents on this island continue to be excluded when it comes to those very same services.""

She added: ""I would also point out that these exclusions go beyond health. We have families living and working here in Derry who are unable to enjoy a day out at the beach in Donegal because of CTA restrictions. These are people who pay their taxes, who pay their National Insurance, who pay their rent and who contribute fully to society.

""We have raised this unfair and unjust anomaly directly with the most senior politicians on this island and will continue to do so until it is addressed.""

In a video interview with PTI, Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems at the WEF said India has been one of the best-performing markets in the world and investors have made money here. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel Blake also struck a word of caution saying that since markets do not move in a purely linear fashion and were prone to ""ups and downs"", there was a need to educate investors. ""So this idea of being an informed investor, a diversified investor, and having access to educational resources to do that is really fundamental artificial intelligence (AI),"" he said. ""I think a combination of different policy choices that have been made make India quite an attractive investment destination. In addition to the digital public infrastructure that creates an enabling environment from a technological standpoint, you also have changes in the bankruptcy law and taxation code adding clarity,"" he said. Blake said a survey of fintech CEOs by the WEF and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had revealed that 70 per cent of the firms considered AI as a major force and could be deployed for personalisation and customisation of products and services. Blake said for sectoral regulators, AI could be helpful in the context of risk management and there was a need for them to adapt to the rapid changes in technology. ""The sophistication level of the regulatory authorities will also need to increase commensurate with the business sector and talent. Technology, and technologically savvy talent, will be at a premium. And that's true in the private sector, and that's true in the public sector,"" he said. Blake said in the Asia-Pacific region, the regulatory agencies were generally viewed as being quite skillful. ""When you look globally, obviously there are varying levels of sophistication of markets. This brings an opportunity globally to share best practices and competencies,"" he said. ""One of the things that we're looking at is how do you bring the most sophisticated actors in the financial services space from the private sector together in a knowledge exchange with some of the key supervisory bodies,"" Blake said. ""It is absolutely in the best interests of the business sector that their corresponding regulator understands as closely as they do their activities and the technologies they're using to conduct those activities. So, it is in the mutual best interest to share that information and to try and level set. That is a rather large challenge, but it's something that we as a team are looking at currently and trying to devote some time to,"" Blake said.

Today, more than 8.5 million do so.

Their numbers will shoot past past nine million from April, when another 650,000 will find themselves dragged into the income tax net, thanks to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's decision to freeze the personal allowance at £12,570 until 2028.

The state pension rises by an inflation-busting 8.5 percent in April, lifting the new state pension to a maximum £11,501 a year.

That's just £1,069 below the personal allowance, which means pensioners only need to generate a small amount of income to pay tax on it.

Pensioners normally do not need to complete a self-assessment tax return, as HMRC automatically calculates what they owe. As a result, many may not realise they have a liability until too late. Those who ring HMRC for advice face a long wait with helplines jammed.

Andrew Tully, technical services director at Nucleus Financial, said HMRC will not tax the state pension itself. ""Instead it will apply the tax to your other sources of income.""

If you are self-employed or have other earnings, such as rental income from a property, you may need to fill in a self-assessment tax return.

The onus is on pensioners to keep an eye on how much tax they owe. This can be complex, especially if they have multiple sources of income, Tully added. ""If you have too much tax deducted, you can reclaim the difference from HMRC, but only if you know it's wrong.""",express.co.uk,news,EXPRESS,Harvey Jones,-0.01960784313725494,448969686,1,https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/23/1200x630/5284091.jpg,

China is by far the world's worst GHG emitter. Its contribution to global GHG emissions is about 32 per cent. So, let's sell China our natural gas, which is a lot cleaner than the coal the Chinese currently use. And sell our LNG to other large emitters as well. This would actually help the planet and would also bring revenues to Canadians. It's called a ""win-win"" solution.

Why our PM is rejecting this ""win-win"" solution is a mystery. Perhaps saving the planet is not his real objective.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen (US$5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

If a foreign player's contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, Japanese authorities classify them as non-residents and they pay less tax than residents, reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

Talking in ARY News show 'Sawal Yeh Hai' Shabbar Zaidi said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has to put his political repute at stake for imposing tax on retailers.

""Every government has failed to impose tax on retailers. They down shutters when tax imposes over them, which results in losses,"" former chief of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) said.

It is to be mentioned here that the FBR has launched a compulsory tax registration scheme focusing retailers and wholesalers in major cities of Pakistan.

The scheme has been launched in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Quetta and Peshawar and will come into effect from April 1, as per an FBR notification.

However, traders will make their first tax payments on July 15, said the notification.

The tax collector body of Pakistan gave a month, with the last date on April 30, to traders and wholesalers to get registered.

The scheme will apply to the traders and shopkeepers operating through a fixed place of business including a shop, store, warehouse, office or similar physical place.

The FBR will launch a Tajir Dost application to create a database of traders and shopkeepers for registration and advance income tax payment.

As per the scheme, traders are bound to pay monthly advance tax on the 15th of each month.

They will have to pay a minimum of Rs1,200 per annum income tax even if their income is below the income tax threshold.

See why,"Even though several Republican lawmakers ran on promises to hammer home further personal income tax cuts during the state elections, interest to bring forth legislation this year may have been put on the back burner.

Several lawmakers told the Clarion Ledger earlier this week that a significant income tax cut bill being requested to be written before the Monday deadline is not likely to happen as the Senate and House of Representatives continue to lobby and advance other legislation such as Medicaid expansion, K-12 education funding and election reform bills, to name a few.

In 2022, the Mississippi Legislature passed House Bill 531, the largest personal income tax cut in state history. That cut began being phased in July 1, 2022, lowering individual income taxes from 5% to 4.7%. In 2025, the cut will phase the tax down to 4.4% and then again in 2026 to 4%.

In November, State Economist Corey Miller told the Joint Legislative Budget Committee that the state economy is expected to grow more than projections at the beginning of the 2023 indicated, but slower future economic growth, combined with the effects of additional decreases in the individual income tax rates, should also lead to a slowdown in general fund revenue growth.

Miller told the Clarion Ledger Monday that as of the past fiscal year, personal income tax contributed $2.5 billion to the state general fund, which lawmakers use as a funding source for various appropriations, funding and general bills.

Miller said that if the state were to implement a complete income tax cut, it would need to evaluate its current spending habits relative to its revenues on top of federal aid that Mississippi received in the form of American Rescue Plan Act money. After the COVID-19 pandemic set in, many states received hundreds of millions of dollars in ARPA funds, and Mississippi got $1.8 billion from the federal government.

""We've seen increases in spending in the past couple of fiscal years that have not kept up with the increase in revenues now that we're slowing,"" Miller said. ""That gap will probably tighten, but that is also going to depend on where the legislature decides to spend its budget.""

Miller said a cut would have relatively insignificant positive impacts on the state economy by way of sales tax. Several lawmakers including former House Speaker Philp Gunn often said that additional revenues in sales tax would more than make up for the loss in income tax. At the time of its passage, it was estimated that going down to 4% would decrease personal income tax revenues by $500 million.

""We've slowed down from where we were (in 2022),"" Miller said. ""A lot of states have implemented tax cuts during that time, and that contributes to some of this lower revenue growth. Overall, I think if we move further away from that COVID era of support, we will just see slower revenue growth than we did.""

Even though HB 531 was passed with bi-partisan support two years ago, interest for further legislation could be waning as lawmakers survey the impact the cuts have on the state's general fund.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Josh Harkins, R-Flowood, told the Clarion Ledger he wouldn't have much appetite to consider another income tax cut bill this year or until the current tax cut is fully phased in.

""We're in the process of a cut that's going to take four years when done, and when that cut is fully implemented, it will be down to 4%,"" Harkins said. ""All the tax brackets will also be fully implemented from our 2016 tax cut, phasing out the franchise tax. We have this year and two more years of implementing the tax cut we passed two years ago. I don't see a need to do anything this year. We've got cuts in place. We've got, a lot of issues in front of us. I don't see us speeding it up.""

In a written response to the Clarion Ledger, Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann echoed Harkins' views on the topic.

""Last term, the Legislature implemented the largest tax cut in Mississippi history,"" Hosemann said. ""We anticipate reviewing the income tax rate again once this cut is completely phased in. Right now, Mississippi's income tax rate is extremely competitive across the nation.""

Both Hosemann and Harkins advocated in 2022 for a phased in tax cut rather than an immediate one, which Republican Gov, Tate Reeves at the time criticized.

Reeves did not respond to requests for comments as to whether his office is lobbying the Legislature for an income tax bill this year.

Corey Custer, Reeves deputy chief of staff, told the Clarion Ledger earlier this month that Reeves is still hopeful that such legislation will still get filed, even if it isn't this year.

""Gov. Reeves believes the single most impactful act to grow Mississippi's economy, and our population would be the full elimination of our personal income tax,"" Custer said. ""The state has collected billions of dollars in excess revenue in recent years and the governor believes we should let our taxpayers keep more of their money they have worked so hard to earn.""

Custer said there is still time for an income tax cut bill to get filed, and that Reeves would prefer lawmakers to focus on that rather than more on what he calls ""government welfare"", such Medicaid expansion.

""The governor remains hopeful that the Republicans who control the Legislature will work on issues like eliminating taxes and rewarding work, while discouraging programs that increase government dependency and welfare,"" Custer said.

But Reeves isn't the only one gunning for another tax cut.

House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, R-Senatobia, said he is actively working on ways to bring forward another income tax cut, but whether that happens this year or next is still up in the air.

""I'm 110% interested in the eventual elimination of the individual income tax, I call it the tax on work,"" Lamar said. ""In the state of Mississippi, I believe we can get there in a reasonable amount of time.""

Lamar said that House leadership simply has other priorities at this time, such as a $3 billion appropriations bill that was passed last week to fund the House's replacement for the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, the INSPIRE Act, as well as Medicaid expansion.

However, Lamar said he is still dedicated to elimination of the state's personal income tax.

""The elimination of the income tax in Mississippi would be a tremendous economic boost to the workforce of our state and, in turn, our state's economy,"" Lamar said.

Republican House Speaker Jason White's office told the Clarion Ledger it received questions regarding his interest in future personal income tax cuts but did not respond by press time Friday afternoon.

The village is establishing a historical preservation commission tasked with determining which properties could be considered historic landmarks. The village will then give a tax break for renovations to those properties.

The move, part of a yearslong effort to preserve its most historically-significant structures, comes at a time when the village is facing substantial development. Awarded $10 million in state downtown revitalization money in 2022, Amityville is in the midst of a main street makeover while awaiting the opening of a 317-unit apartment complex on the former site of Brunswick Hospital.

""We're having a lot of construction right now,"" said Joe Guidice, village historian and president of the Amityville Historical Society. ""Time is of the essence to save these properties.""

The village will announce the members of the preservation commission on April 8, said Mayor Dennis Siry. Members will be appointed to one-year terms, and be charged with establishing the criteria for a ""historical"" designation and coming up with a list of potential sites, he said. Those property owners will then be approached and asked if they want the historic status.

The approach is a more tender one than originally pursued by the village, Siry said. Several years ago Amityville established a Certified Local Government, or CGL, committee and was moving toward obtaining that status. CGL is a federal program administered by the New York State Historic Preservation Office with strict requirements for historic properties that do not require approval of the owner. According to the state's webpage, as of June there are 11 municipalities on Long Island that have the status.

""We didn't want to just come in and say, 'Hey, your house is historic and you can't do this or that to it,' "" Siry said. ""We wanted to respect the rights of the homeowner, but we also wanted to do what we could to prevent anything bad from happening.""

Owners who opt in to the historic status and make approved renovations to their home will not have to pay the increase in village taxes associated with the home's rise in assessed value from the renovations for five years, according to village attorney Bruce Kennedy. After that, the taxes will increase by 20% per year for the next five years until homeowners pay the full amount, he said.

""The purpose is to encourage people who have historic properties to fix them up,"" Kennedy said.

Guidice, 69, said the historical society has been cataloging historically-significant properties and already has a list of at least two dozen.

He said he hopes the village holds meetings to inform residents about grants available to those rehabbing historic buildings and the benefits of having a historic home.

""I think the key is education and letting people know about not just the monetary benefits but the general reasons for this,"" he said.",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,0.0980392156862746,448968510,1,https://assets.projects.newsday.com/logos/nd-fb-share-logo-600x315.jpg,

Islandwide, preliminary district reports analyzed by Newsday show that property taxes would rise an average 2.67% during 2024-25. At least 35 districts project hikes of 3% or more.

In comparison, estimates of regionwide taxes were up only 2.21% at this time last year and 1.9% the year before.

Some increases in tax collections, known as levies, are running higher. William Floyd has forecast a 4.27% rise, Eastport-South Manor 4.96% and West Babylon 9.98%.

Newsday's review was based mostly on reports from more than 120 Long Island districts submitted to the state Comptroller's Office and covering nearly $9.8 billion in overall tax revenues. State law requires these projections as of March 1 each year as a kind of ""early alert"" for taxpayers. School levies account for more than 60% of homeowners' tax bills on the Island.

Districts are scheduled to report final tax and spending plans by April 26. Public voting on proposed budgets will be held May 21.

In the meantime, the financial picture for the Island's school systems for the next academic year remains in flux.

District have based tax estimates largely on Gov. Kathy Hochul's proposed state budget released in January. That plan called for a statewide school-aid increase of $825 million, or 2.4%, which was well below the inflation rate of 3.2%. At the time, Hochul said the state faced a multimillion-dollar budget deficit and needed to tighten its finances.

The governor's plan for 2024-25 came as a bit of a shock and was considered lean by education advocates, because it followed three years of record aid increases totaling more than $7 billion statewide.

Forty-four districts in Nassau and Suffolk counties would lose aid under the governor's current plan. Most other systems would gain money, but not as much as they would have, had Hochul not trimmed back a state formula governing allotment of ""foundation"" aid, the largest source of support.

More recently, the governor has taken a somewhat different position, reporting earlier this month that annual state revenues were expected to run $1.3 billion higher than originally thought. Hochul's aides have suggested that much of the extra money could be used to assist schools.

Another wrinkle for schools is that federal COVID relief payments, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, are due to dry up in the fall. That poses a particular problem for districts that used money to hire extra counselors and other workers during the pandemic and now face a potential choice between layoffs and tax hikes.

At the local level, many school officials said they're still waiting for the governor and legislators to approve an actual state budget before they make any revisions in tax plans. Most districts at this point are projecting the maximum rate hikes permitted under New York's strict tax-cap law.

""It's not surprising that the overwhelming majority of districts at this point are projecting budgets that require them to go out with their maximum allowable caps,"" said Bob Vecchio, executive director of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association. He added that budget pressures were largely due to what he called ""uncertainty created by the governor's proposal.""

A final state budget is due April 1, though negotiations over details could delay completion.

Meanwhile, education representatives continue to press for more money. Last weekend, hundreds of teacher-union representatives gathered near county offices in Hauppauge to protest what they called the ""harsh effects"" of the governor's original aid plan.

At local school board meetings, a question often raised is whether teachers might face layoffs, and students the loss of services, unless Albany comes up with more cash.

Amityville's school board on March 6 approved cutting 47 staff positions, including teachers, to fill a $3.6 million budget gap.

Then on Tuesday, Riverhead officials said they would cut nearly 38 teaching positions and 18 teaching assistant slots, while reducing the district's dual-language program. Reasons cited included a drying up of federal COVID relief money along with state underfunding.

On Wednesday, the Sachem district announced planned staffing cuts: At least 60 teachers could lose their jobs because of a nearly $12 million budget shortfall.

In Port Washington, one of the systems that would lose aid, Kathleen Manuel, the district's assistant superintendent for business, told board trustees at a March 5 meeting that the district faced a potential $5.38 million gap between spending and revenues. Manuel suggested that the district consider options for closing the gap -- for example, a tax increase beyond the 3%-plus already proposed, or dozens of staff layoffs.

Once the budget presentation was completed, a board member, Adam Block, described the options as ""soul-crushing."" Block went on, however, to sound a more hopeful note.

""I'm cautiously optimistic that the governor is going to step in, realize the box that we've been put in,"" Block said.

Elsewhere, four districts, including West Babylon, have announced tentative plans to seek bigger tax increases through voter overrides of state cap restrictions. Approval under state rules requires voter majorities of at least 60%.

The three other systems, Amagansett, East Hampton and Springs, all in the East End, have proposed rate hikes of 7.77%, 9.7% and 13.04%, respectively.

In West Babylon, a March 12 board meeting attracted dozens of residents, many of whom came to hear about the district's tax plan. Superintendent Yiendhy Farrelly told the audience that she and board members were ""exploring every area"" that could produce possible cost savings, including consolidation of bus routes, staff cuts and grant applications.

Farrelly said the district faced more than $6 million in additional costs next year as part of its proposed $139 million budget, and needed to find extra revenues either through higher taxes or other means. Some of the biggest cost items include regional BOCES services, up $4 million; employee salaries, up $2.5 million; and employee benefits, up $2.37 million.

At two points during the meeting, residents were invited to walk over to a microphone and voice their opinions about the budget or other issues. None stepped forward.

Four residents, however, told a Newsday reporter covering the meeting that they had misgivings about a large tax increase. One of them, Jennifer Trounson, a parent, voiced hope that the 9.98% figure under consideration might eventually be lowered.

""I feel that number is high and may result in a failed budget,"" Trounson said. ""But there's still time for the board to come up with their final decision.""

Farrelly later emailed a requested statement to Newsday on issues raised at the meeting.

""As we await the final NYS aid projections, the district remains hopeful and most certainly would welcome and appreciate any additional increase in state aid, which would allow us to help offset some of the budget constraints we are currently dealing with,"" the statement read in part.

In Albany, both the State Senate and Assembly have adopted separate bills that would increase state aid to schools by an additional $1.3 billion, with increases of at least 3% for every district. Points of disagreement remain between the governor and legislators, however.

Lawmakers, for example, seek to further raise income-tax rates on multimillionaires as a means of collecting more revenue. Rates on high earners in this state already rank among the nation's highest, second only to California's.

Hochul calls the latest income-tax proposal a ""nonstarter"" and warns against making the state less affordable.

For her part, the governor continues to press for elimination of ""hold harmless"" provisions in school-aid regulations that guarantee districts at least as much assistance as they received in prior years, even if their enrollments fall.

""We can't kick this can down the road, and we don't want to raise taxes,"" she stated in a recent website video. ""That leaves one choice: Find common-sense ways to reduce spending growth.""

Legislators contend that tossing out ""hold harmless"" without extensive review would amount to pulling the rug out from under districts that have come to expect such protection. Lawmakers predict, moreover, that when all the haggling is over, there will be substantially more money for schools.

Though it passed by a large and bipartisan majority in the House, enactment of this legislation, commonly referred to as the Smith-Wyden tax bill, is no sure thing. That's because members of the U.S. Senate share the same concerns about the bill that caused some House Republicans to vote against it.

A point of contention is the boosted child tax credit. By making the child tax credit partially refundable, it results in the federal government giving money to households with no income tax liability in some instances. Some House Republicans objected to Smith-Wyden's boosting of the child tax credit, with Congressman Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) attacking the proposal as ""a welfare bill in drag.""

Yet many House Republicans who share Gaetz's objection still voted for the Smith-Wyden bill. Congressman Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), a member of the Ways & Means Committee who voted for the bill, noted that he shares his colleagues' concerns about certain provisions, but added ""there's also a thing called negotiation.""

The U.S. Senate will soon take up the Smith-Wyden tax bill. If enacted, this reform will provide tens of billions of dollars worth of tax relief to individuals, families and businesses annually by restoring business cost recovery provisions that have phased out in recent years.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the 2017 tax reform bill, provided full business expensing, allowing employers to fully deduct capital expenditures, along with research and development costs, in year one. But, given the constraints of the budget reconciliation process through which the TCJA passed, full expensing began phasing out in 2022.

Businesses are now allowed to deduct only 60% of the capital expenditures that occur in 2024 and must depreciate the remaining value over multiple years. Enactment of the Smith-Wyden tax bill would mean that businesses are once again able to fully deduct capital expenditures for the tax year in which they were purchased. Smith-Wyden's restoration of of full business and R&D expensing is retroactive to the beginning of 2022.

Permanent full business expensing, along with full deductibility for R&D costs, would grow the size of the economy by 0.5% over the next ten years, according to the Tax Foundation. As home to 300 aerospace companies and 450 aerospace suppliers, along with a burgeoning automotive manufacturing industry that employs 445,000 people, North Carolina has many employers for whom full expensing is crucial.

If Smith-Wyden becomes law, it will be even more beneficial for the North Carolina General Assembly to make the state tax code conform to the federal code's treatment of capital expenditures. Research from the Business Roundtable found the states with full expensing policies had 5% wage increases for workers in manufacturing facilities compared to states without the policy.

""North Carolina has been a national model for tax reform over the past dozen years, and we should continue to make wise moves like conforming to the Smith-Wyden full expensing provision in order to remain the nation's best state to do business,"" said Brian Balfour, vice president of research at the John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh-based think tank. ""Considering that North Carolina is home to the Research Triangle, a premier global technology innovation hub located between Raleigh and Durham, the R&D expensing provision would be especially beneficial.""

Passage of Smith-Wyden is particularly important to keeping North Carolina a globally competitive destination for R&D. A report from Ernst & Young estimates that failure to reinstate full business expensing would depress U.S. economic growth by $45 billion over the next decade and reduce R&D spending by $70 billion. While failure to restore full expensing is projected to destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs, its reinstatement would create 1.2 million jobs over the next 10 years, according to EY's projections.

Aside from the boost that restoration of full expensing would have for employers, enactment of Smith-Wyden would also make extending the rest of the TCJA's temporary provisions, which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, less difficult. That is why many North Carolina employers hope that members of the U.S. Senate ultimately decide that, while Smith-Wyden has its flaws, the economic boost that full expensing would provide makes the overall package worth passing.

It's top of mind because of how the Avalanche finished last season -- both with a furious charge at the end of the regular season to claim a division title that has become a source of pride, but also an early postseason exit when some of that team's flaws were exposed. A couple of recent trends might help make the answer to that question less important.

The Avalanche has been rolling lately, buttressed by a quartet of new players, the return of Valeri Nichushkin and improved play in net from both goaltenders. In a season where the expectations were clear from the jump -- Stanley Cup or bust -- how the team is playing has been more important than the results for much of the campaign.

If the Avs are playing well without overtaxing the superstars or overplaying the starting goalie, then there's little reason to change anything.

""The important thing is to be playing the right way and you're finding ways to win hockey games consistently,"" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. ""So the confidence in your team grows and you feel good about being able to come back on teams, win home and road, etc. It's important. We're not going to empty the tank, but we're going to play to win and hopefully finish at the top of this thing.""

The second part of this is how stacked the Western Conference is. The top of the Central is the best in the league -- all three teams at the top are Cup contenders -- and the Nashville Predators have surged of late and are now the most successful fourth-place team.

Even if we allow the idea that Colorado could try to win just enough or lose just enough to manipulate its position in the standings and find a favorable first-round matchup, the reality is ... there might not be one. If the Avs win the West and earn the top seed, right now that would mean facing the defending champion Vegas Golden Knights in the first round.

If they win the Central but not the West, that likely means Nashville, a club that has beaten them twice this season and is white hot with a goalie capable of stealing games. And if the Avs don't win the division, that means a first-round dogfight with Winnipeg or Dallas.

""It's still going to get you a really tough opponent,"" Bednar said. ""You finish top of the conference or top of the division and (Vegas) is who you're seeing. That's not an ideal first-round matchup. Playing Winnipeg or Dallas isn't either. You try to take the advantages you can, which is home ice.""

The Avs have been the best team on home ice this season, so getting to play four times out of seven at Ball Arena in as many series as possible could be a worthwhile goal. A recent four-game sweep on the road has also eased whatever concerns there were about the club's road struggles.

Having Game 7 at home last season didn't matter, but this is a different team. And if the first-round opponent doesn't really matter, that small psychological advantage could be the difference.

""I remember this as an opposing player, but it was always when (the Avs) got one, immediately it was 'don't let them get two,' because three and four were coming,"" Avs forward Zach Parise said. ""The building gets going. It feels like you can't breathe, because they were all over you. That's just the way it has been here with this team. Maybe it's the altitude that plays into that, but I just remember it was always hard coming in here.""

Some of the fretting about potentially having to face Vegas is what the Knights could be if everyone is healthy and playing at a peak level. That version of Vegas is terrifying, particularly with new additions that have essentially made this a $100 million roster.

That version of Vegas also hasn't shown up at an NHL rink in months. Sure, adding Noah Hanifin and Anthony Mantha makes the Knights stronger, but Tomas Hertl hasn't played since January. Mark Stone might not be ready for the first round and also hasn't played in a month.

If Vegas gets rolling and gets everyone healthy, it might be the best team in the league. It also might not have everyone available or at 100% in round one, so maybe trying to deal with the Knights immediately is actually the best time.

Or, the best way to look at it is the Avs are almost certainly going to have a tougher path this season than they did two years ago, so focusing on themselves and the process matters even more than the results and who they may or may not have to play.

""The way we're playing now, we're using four lines, pretty balanced minutes coming out of lots of games, we're using both goaltenders. ... We are going to play to win,"" Bednar said.",timescall.com,news,Longmont Times-Call,Corey Masisak,0.5607843137254902,448968051,1,https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TDP-L-AVS-BLACKHAWKSAO2_1440xxx.jpg?w=640,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid, reports Yonhap News Agency.

The number 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

The Scottish Government has announced that tax reliefs at the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport will be extended to 2034.

The extension, by five years comes after Scottish Ministers backed proposals first set out in the UK government's Autumn Statement.

It will also apply to the Forth Green Freeport and prospective Investment Zones in Glasgow City Region and the North East of Scotland.

Green Freeports and the National Islands Plan were at the top of the agenda at a meeting of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands (CoHI) in Elgin on March 18.

CoHI is a meeting between the Scottish Government and its agencies, represented by the chairperson of each organisation.

It is held twice yearly and is hosted by a different local authority each time with the location alternating between a mainland and an island setting.

The Convention is intended to strengthen co-ordination between member organisations, the Scottish Government, and other representative bodies.

Ahead of the Convention, Deputy First Minister Shona Robison said: ""I am pleased that Scottish and UK Ministers have reached agreement on extending the tax reliefs window for Green Freeports, from 2029 to 2034.

""We strongly support firm joint action to ensure that the Green Freeports and prospective Investment Zones - and the landowners and businesses operating within them - all live up to a clear set of policy commitments, particularly in relation to our just transition to net zero and fair work principles.

""We continue to work constructively with the UK Government and the Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport consortium to get the project up and running as quickly as possible and ensure it has maximum positive impact for businesses, communities and Scotland's wider economy.""",northern-times.co.uk,news,Northern Times,,0.2862745098039217,448967498,1,https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/CXEZ8BQG0E7WG3ILVNQU.jpg,

See why,"State Economist says state revenues likely to slow down as current income tax cut gets phased in

Even though several Republican lawmakers ran on promises to hammer home further personal income tax cuts during the state elections, interest to bring forth legislation this year may have been put on the back burner.

Several lawmakers told the Clarion Ledger earlier this week that a significant income tax cut bill being requested to be written before the Monday deadline is not likely to happen as the Senate and House of Representatives continue to lobby and advance other legislation such as Medicaid expansion, K-12 education funding and election reform bills, to name a few.

In 2022, the Mississippi Legislature passed House Bill 531, the largest personal income tax cut in state history. That cut began being phased in July 1, 2022, lowering individual income taxes from 5% to 4.7%. In 2025, the cut will phase the tax down to 4.4% and then again in 2026 to 4%.

In November, State Economist Corey Miller told the Joint Legislative Budget Committee that the state economy is expected to grow more than projections at the beginning of the 2023 indicated, but slower future economic growth, combined with the effects of additional decreases in the individual income tax rates, should also lead to a slowdown in general fund revenue growth.

Miller told the Clarion Ledger Monday that as of the past fiscal year, personal income tax contributed $2.5 billion to the state general fund, which lawmakers use as a funding source for various appropriations, funding and general bills.

Miller said that if the state were to implement a complete income tax cut, it would need to evaluate its current spending habits relative to its revenues on top of federal aid that Mississippi received in the form of American Rescue Plan Act money. After the COVID-19 pandemic set in, many states received hundreds of millions of dollars in ARPA funds, and Mississippi got $1.8 billion from the federal government.

""We've seen increases in spending in the past couple of fiscal years that have not kept up with the increase in revenues now that we're slowing,"" Miller said. ""That gap will probably tighten, but that is also going to depend on where the legislature decides to spend its budget.""

Miller said a cut would have relatively insignificant positive impacts on the state economy by way of sales tax. Several lawmakers including former House Speaker Philp Gunn often said that additional revenues in sales tax would more than make up for the loss in income tax. At the time of its passage, it was estimated that going down to 4% would decrease personal income tax revenues by $500 million.

""We've slowed down from where we were (in 2022),"" Miller said. ""A lot of states have implemented tax cuts during that time, and that contributes to some of this lower revenue growth. Overall, I think if we move further away from that COVID era of support, we will just see slower revenue growth than we did.""

Even though HB 531 was passed with bi-partisan support two years ago, interest for further legislation could be waning as lawmakers survey the impact the cuts have on the state's general fund.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Josh Harkins, R-Flowood, told the Clarion Ledger he wouldn't have much appetite to consider another income tax cut bill this year or until the current tax cut is fully phased in.

""We're in the process of a cut that's going to take four years when done, and when that cut is fully implemented, it will be down to 4%,"" Harkins said. ""All the tax brackets will also be fully implemented from our 2016 tax cut, phasing out the franchise tax. We have this year and two more years of implementing the tax cut we passed two years ago. I don't see a need to do anything this year. We've got cuts in place. We've got, a lot of issues in front of us. I don't see us speeding it up.""

In a written response to the Clarion Ledger, Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann echoed Harkins' views on the topic.

""Last term, the Legislature implemented the largest tax cut in Mississippi history,"" Hosemann said. ""We anticipate reviewing the income tax rate again once this cut is completely phased in. Right now, Mississippi's income tax rate is extremely competitive across the nation.""

Both Hosemann and Harkins advocated in 2022 for a phased in tax cut rather than an immediate one, which Republican Gov, Tate Reeves at the time criticized.

Reeves did not respond to requests for comments as to whether his office is lobbying the Legislature for an income tax bill this year.

Corey Custer, Reeves deputy chief of staff, told the Clarion Ledger earlier this month that Reeves is still hopeful that such legislation will still get filed, even if it isn't this year.

""Gov. Reeves believes the single most impactful act to grow Mississippi's economy, and our population would be the full elimination of our personal income tax,"" Custer said. ""The state has collected billions of dollars in excess revenue in recent years and the governor believes we should let our taxpayers keep more of their money they have worked so hard to earn.""

Custer said there is still time for an income tax cut bill to get filed, and that Reeves would prefer lawmakers to focus on that rather than more on what he calls ""government welfare"", such Medicaid expansion.

""The governor remains hopeful that the Republicans who control the Legislature will work on issues like eliminating taxes and rewarding work, while discouraging programs that increase government dependency and welfare,"" Custer said.

But Reeves isn't the only one gunning for another tax cut.

House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, R-Senatobia, said he is actively working on ways to bring forward another income tax cut, but whether that happens this year or next is still up in the air.

""I'm 110% interested in the eventual elimination of the individual income tax, I call it the tax on work,"" Lamar said. ""In the state of Mississippi, I believe we can get there in a reasonable amount of time.""

Lamar said that House leadership simply has other priorities at this time, such as a $3 billion appropriations bill that was passed last week to fund the House's replacement for the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, the INSPIRE Act, as well as Medicaid expansion.

However, Lamar said he is still dedicated to elimination of the state's personal income tax.

""The elimination of the income tax in Mississippi would be a tremendous economic boost to the workforce of our state and, in turn, our state's economy,"" Lamar said.

Republican House Speaker Jason White's office told the Clarion Ledger it received questions regarding his interest in future personal income tax cuts but did not respond by press time Friday afternoon.

The IMF has proposed increasing the levy on petrol by Pakistani currency (PKR) 60 and reinstating the 18 per cent GST previously abolished in March 2022.

The amount of federal excise duty on petroleum products in the fiscal year 2023 was 0.7 per cent of the GDP, while for other items, it was 0.4 per cent of the GDP, mainly obtained from the federal excise duty on cigarettes.

The Petroleum Development Levy has undergone several changes in recent years, but there was a significant increase in it in fiscal year 2023.

It has been proposed to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in the country, such as yachts, while enhancing border control. This is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of petroleum byproducts from sensitive areas in particular.

According to reports, an increase in federal excise duty (FED) at a uniform rate on domestically manufactured cigarettes has been recommended by the IMF. There is also a proposal to apply the same tax rate to imported cigarettes as local cigarettes.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that the financially beleaguered nation needed another long-term bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise its fragile economy, ARY News reported.

""A new tranche of loan is likely to be received from the IMF in a few days, however, we would need another programme,"" he said while addressing the session of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) apex committee attended by civil-military leadership.

The comments came a day after the IMF agreed to a staff-level agreement with Islamabad which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion under an existing USD 3 billion standby arrangement.

He said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the review for issuance of the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion which hopefully be received by next month.

""We will succeed gradually in breaking the begging bowl and coming out of the debt trap with the reforms,"" PM Sharif said.

He also sought the support of all political parties and the provincial governments to successfully implement the agenda of macroeconomic stability in the country, ARY News reported.

Notably, the IMF mission that visited Islamabad for five days on the last review of the stand-by programme said Pakistani authorities expressed interest in yet another bailout.",industriesnews.net,news,industriesnews.net,,0.1294117647058823,448967057,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ani1711207712.jpg,

But strengthening our financial health is just as important to leading a long and healthy life. Financial stress can impact mental health, leading to conditions like anxiety and insomnia, and worsen physical health, including increasing the risks of heart disease.

Addressing financial stress can be a powerful prescription that works alongside other treatments. Providing easy access to financial empowerment services can dramatically reduce financial stress and lead to improved physical and mental health.

In fact, research shows that getting important tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit, is linked to both infant and maternal health improvements. That is why, since 2018, the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and NYC Health + Hospitals have partnered together to form medical-financial partnerships and provide NYC Free Tax Prep services for eligible New Yorkers.

Just last year, our joint efforts helped almost 2,000 clients file their taxes for free, saving them nearly $300,000 in tax preparation fees and building on research that highlights the return on investment for low-income New Yorkers. This tax season, New Yorkers who made $85,000 or less as a family in 2023, or $59,000 as an individual or couple without dependents, are eligible to take advantage of NYC Free Tax Prep and avoid costly tax preparation fees.

The city's network of NYC Free Tax Prep providers helped file more than 84,000 tax returns in 2023, saving New Yorkers more than $13 million in filing fees, but we know that thousands of eligible New Yorkers and their families are not taking advantage of this service and are not getting the fullest refund possible.

Paying for tax preparation services can be costly, and run upwards of $300, preventing many families from receiving the most money possible. We also know that some paid tax preparers take advantage of consumers by promising refund anticipation loans or express refund advances to charge hidden fees and interest to filers.

Our NYC Free Tax Prep volunteers are trained by the Internal Revenue Service to provide professional tax preparation services. These dedicated tax heroes make sure that clients receive the maximum refund possible, including the NYC Earned Income Tax Credit, which Mayor Adams expanded last tax season for the first time in almost 20 years, all at no cost. There are more than 140 sites around the city and in-person and virtual options are conveniently offered through more than 20 NYC Health + Hospitals sites. Services are available in multiple languages.

In recognizing the successes of co-locating NYC Free Tax Prep services in our public hospitals and clinics, the mayor announced earlier this year at his State of the City address that DCWP will embed Financial Empowerment Center services at select NYC Health + Hospitals sites.

NYC Financial Empowerment Centers offer free one-on-one professional and confidential financial counseling services to help New Yorkers reach their financial goals. Our counselors are trained to do a full financial health assessment to help New Yorkers manage their money, establish or improve their credit, open safe and affordable bank accounts, reduce debt (including student loan debt), create spending plans, and more.

Since their inception in 2008, NYC Financial Empowerment Centers have served more than 73,000 clients, helping them to reduce their overall debt by more than $100 million and increase their savings by more than $11 million.

Expanding access to these vital financial health services at NYC Health + Hospitals sites builds on research that highlights the health benefits of providing financial counseling at clinical centers. These counselors will offer all of the services available at Financial Empowerment Centers across the city, but conveniently located where many New Yorkers receive health care.

They add to NYC Health + Hospitals' array of interventions to identify and support patients' social needs, such as health-related social needs screening in primary care and an emergency cash transfer program for low-income COVID-19 patients at the onset of the pandemic.

Since the beginning of the Adams administration, the mayor has challenged us to collaborate to find new and creative ways to help more working New Yorkers, and to take a holistic view to improving the health and wellbeing of our neighbors. Integrating DCWP's financial health services at NYC Health + Hospitals ensures that patients get both the health and financial care they need to improve their lives and achieve their goals.

One of the few issues that nearly every American can agree on is that filing your taxes has become too complicated and too expensive, and we need a better path forward.

Luckily, for nearly three million taxpayers in New York this year, there is a solution. This filing season, the IRS is piloting a Direct File program that would allow eligible taxpayers to file their tax returns online directly and securely with the IRS for free.

Americans spend 1.7 billion hours or $31 billion annually to file their taxes, even though the overwhelming majority have simple tax cases and should be able to file in minutes and for free. Millions more find it too hard or expensive to file taxes at all, and miss out on credits they would have otherwise earned.

For far too long, for-profit tax preparers have taken advantage of our broken tax filing system in order to extract as much profit as possible from vulnerable taxpayers. Our own Attorney General Letitia James spearheaded a $141 million settlement with Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax, that put money back in the pockets of users who were tricked by the company into paying for services marketed as free. More than 176,000 New Yorkers received checks through the settlement, totaling more than $5.4 million.

It's not just the major preparers like TurboTax that are preying on taxpayers. In New York and across the country, there are a concerning number of smaller, unregulated tax preparers that deliberately target low-income and non-English speaking filers and disproportionately cluster in communities of color.

A study from the Government Accountability Office found that more than half of paid preparers lack credentials and have a significantly higher error rate, leaving customers far more vulnerable to audits. In 2016, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs issued violations to two out of five tax preparers in the city for offenses including failing to post prices, misrepresenting their qualifications, and violating other consumer rights.

A free tax filing option would save New Yorkers $150 and nine hours every tax season on average. This is especially transformational for low-income filers, as well as communities of color, who are disproportionately harmed by the complicated tax system.

For example, in 2020 one in five New Yorkers eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit did not claim it, in part because it was too complicated to file themselves, or because lack of better options caused them to use an unregulated tax preparer.

New Yorkers overwhelmingly want a Direct File tool. Recent polling from the Better IRS campaign and research firm GQR found that 94% of New Yorkers support the IRS providing a free, IRS-run digital tax service. This support holds steady across race, political party, and income, and among both upstate and New York City residents.

Taxpayers across the country also support the choice to file their taxes for free. Recent polling from Hart Research found that 88% of Americans support the Direct File pilot program, and more than 75% of respondents would likely try the free file tool. That's what this fight is really about: choice. Direct File offers a much-needed alternative for the millions of Americans seeking a free, simplified way to file taxes.

However, the for-profit tax preparation industry and their allies in Congress are pouring billions of dollars and hundreds of hours into limiting taxpayers' choices, all to protect their own bottom line. Their bad faith arguments against the program fail to hold up, especially considering that the industry has a long and well-documented history of taking advantage of American taxpayers.

In just the past few months, the Federal Trade Commission ordered both TurboTax and H&R Block to stop falsely advertising their services as free. An estimated 87 million taxpayers lose as much as $13 billion of their refunds to tax preparation fees annually because the industry makes it difficult to access the free file system.

New York taxpayers deserve better. Anyone filing in New York can check the Direct File website to see if they are eligible for the pilot program; if the pilot succeeds this year, more and more taxpayers across New York and the country will be able to access this tool in the coming years.

She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

'Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,' said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's 'still happy we have our cows.'

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third-largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

FILE - A man walks holding an umbrella past a cow at a farm adjacent to a residential apartment complex in Kochi, southern Kerala state, India, June 11, 2022.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with more than 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

'Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,' said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. 'These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,' he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

'Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,' she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

'Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,' said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

'You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,' he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

'In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,' Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

If a foreign player's contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, Japanese authorities classify them as non-residents and they pay less tax than residents, reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members and was on a multi-year contract.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said in the statement, obtained by AFP on Sunday.

Iniesta has now paid the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The Osaka regional taxation bureau declined to comment when contacted by AFP.

News agency Kyodo reported last week that South Korea goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyeon and Brazilian forward Patric had also failed to declare their income properly in Japan.

Cerezo Osaka keeper Kim has been ordered to pay 220 million yen in back taxes and Patric, previously at Gamba Osaka and currently at Nagoya Grampus, 210 million yen, Kyodo said.

Cerezo Osaka declined to comment, citing privacy concerns, while Gamba Osaka said they were ""handling the matter appropriately and under the guidance of the tax authorities and the J-League"", the report added.",guardian.ng,news,The Guardian,,-0.09019607843137256,448966039,1,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Iniesta-640x360.jpg,

She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

'Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,' said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's 'still happy we have our cows.'

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third-largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with more than 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

'Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,' said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. 'These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,' he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

'Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,' she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

'Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,' said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

The decommissioning of all units had been planned earlier. In order to save natural gas in power generation during the energy crisis, the German government had taken five units out of the so-called supply reserve. Two further units were allowed to continue operating beyond the originally planned shutdown date. All were allowed to sell their electricity wholesale. At the end of the winter of 2023/24, it will finally be over.

Units E and F at the Niederaussem power plant and unit C at the Neurath power plant in the Rhineland mining district were taken out of standby. All of them belong to the RWE energy group. In the Lusatian coalfield, units E and F at the Jänschwalde power plant, which belong to the energy company Leag, were reclaimed. In addition, two further units (D and E) at RWE's Neurath power plant were extended.

Former employees also returned from retirement to their old jobs for the reactivation of the plants from security standby. Others postponed the start of their retirement.

The seven units have a total output of around 3.1 gigawatts. By comparison, the Datteln 4 hard coal-fired power plant has an output of just under 1.1 gigawatts. According to the Federal Network Agency, electricity generation plants with a total capacity of 245 gigawatts were on the market in Germany in November. Renewable energy sources accounted for around 159 gigawatts of this.

The grid agency does not believe that the shutdowns will affect the security of supply. ""The closures have been planned and taken into account accordingly in all supply forecasts. Security of supply is still guaranteed,"" said a spokesperson. Electricity will be generated in the European network where it is cheapest. ""Germany and the other European countries benefit mutually from the most favorable generation conditions."" In each case, the cheapest generation technologies currently available would be used first, said the spokesperson.

The Federal Ministry of Economics is legally obliged to examine how much additional greenhouse gas has been emitted by the continued operation of coal-fired power plants. It must make proposals by the end of June as to what measures can be taken to offset these additional emissions./tob/DP/zb",marketscreener.com,news,Market Screener,,0.1372549019607843,448965441,1,,

The discourse around AI regulation has intensified with AI applications permeating daily life, from chatbots and translation services to recruitment processes. This comes against the backdrop of global movements towards tighter AI governance, highlighted by legislative developments in the European Union and executive actions in the United States.

As AI technologies become increasingly embedded in South Korean society, concerns over privacy, discrimination, and surveillance have sparked debate among policymakers, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the tech industry. The government's current legislative proposal to regulate AI has faced criticism for its perceived leniency towards industry growth over addressing the ethical and societal implications of AI deployment. Critics argue that the bill lacks comprehensive measures to ensure transparency, accountability, and protection against the misuse of AI technologies.

In response to the government's proposition, over 120 CSOs, led by prominent digital rights groups like Jinbonet, have vocalized their opposition. They advocate for a more stringent AI regulation framework that prioritizes human rights, safety, and democratic values. Their proposed AI bill encompasses a national supervision system, enhanced transparency, risk assessment protocols, and mechanisms for redressing violations. This initiative reflects a growing consensus among civil society actors on the need for preemptive measures to safeguard against the potential adverse impacts of AI.

The ongoing debate over AI regulation in South Korea is set against the broader context of global AI governance trends and domestic political dynamics. With the general election on the horizon, the outcome could significantly influence the future direction of AI legislation in the country. Civil society groups are gearing up to mobilize public support for their version of the AI bill, emphasizing the importance of addressing AI risks proactively.

As discussions continue, the contrast between the pro-industry stance and civil society's call for stringent regulations underscores the complexity of balancing innovation with ethical considerations. The outcome of this legislative debate will likely have far-reaching implications for the development and deployment of AI technologies in South Korea and beyond.

The discourse around AI regulation in South Korea highlights the critical need for a balanced approach that supports technological advancement while protecting against its potential downsides. As the country navigates this challenging landscape, the collaboration between government, industry, and civil society will be crucial in crafting legislation aligning with national interests and global standards for AI governance. With the general election approaching, the direction of AI policy in South Korea hangs in the balance, underscoring the importance of informed and inclusive decision-making in shaping the future of AI regulation.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.3019607843137255,448965309,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9419058

The following are some practical methods that those making more than this level can use to reduce their tax liability.

Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, ELSS funds provide tax benefits, enabling individuals to claim deductions of up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs yearly.

Individuals can receive deductions under Section 80CCD(1B) of up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs when they contribute to NPS, in addition to the Section 80C maximum.

When taxpayers invest in health insurance premiums for themselves, their families, or their parents, they can deduct up to Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 50,000 for senior citizens).

Under Sections 80C and 24(b), respectively, the principle and interest paid on home loans are deductible, offering substantial tax benefit.

To lower your taxable income, claim deductions for professional taxes you paid during the fiscal year.

Employees might receive additional tax benefits by contributing more to the VPF than the required EPF limit.

These changes, which will begin in the new financial year, will affect National Insurance, wages, benefits, and pensions, reports WalesOnline.

Many regular payments will go up, especially for households that need help the most. New work and tax laws will also start, affecting things like wages and car tax. But wages will also be increased, particularly for the lowest earners and young people.

Here's a list of all the changes happening in April and how they might change things for you.

How much could WASPI women get as Ombudsman rules on state pension age changes DWP State Pension update as thousands could be owed up to £12,000 each National living wage and minimum wage going up

From April 1, both the national living wage - the money most UK workers get paid and the minimum wage for younger workers will go up. The national living wage is now £10.42 per hour for workers aged over 23, but in April 2024 it will go up to £11.44, reports Cambridgeshire Live.

This new amount will also be for 21 and 22 year olds for the first time, making their yearly pay go up by £1,800, according to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. The national minimum wage for 18 to 20 year olds will go up by £1.11, making it £8.60 per hour. Apprentices and 16 and 17 year olds will also see their minimum hourly rates go up from £5.28 to £6.40.

Changes to car tax

Starting from April 1, car tax is going up for many drivers. This includes people with petrol, diesel, and hybrid cars.

The government says the tax, called vehicle excise duty (VED), will go up because of inflation. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said that rates ""will remain unchanged in real terms"" but the changes will ""impact"" vehicle owners. The more pollution your car makes, the more tax you have to pay.

If your car makes a lot of pollution, over 255g/km, you'll need to pay £140 more in the first year. That means the total cost will be £2,745. Cars are put into groups based on how much they pollute if they were registered after March 1, 2001.

For the most polluting cars in band M, the yearly tax will go up by £40, from £695 to £735. Band L cars will pay £35 more, and bands K and J will pay £20 more.

Even cleaner cars will cost more to tax, but not as much. If you have a big engine car (over 1549cc) that was registered before March 1, 2001, your tax will go up by £20. Smaller engine cars will see a £10 increase. If you drive an electric car, you don't have to pay any VED right now. But this could change in April 2025.

TV Licence

The yearly cost of a TV licence is set to rise from £159 to £169.50 starting from April 1. This fee is necessary if you watch or record live TV shows on any channel, whether it's on a TV, PC, laptop, tablet, or phone.

If you don't pay it, you're breaking the law and could be fined up to £1,000 if you're caught not paying for one when you should be. You also need to pay for a TV licence if you use BBC iPlayer, even if you only watch shows on catch-up. But, you don't need to pay to watch back things on Netflix, Amazon Prime, ITVX, Disney Plus, YouTube, All 4, or My5.

However, the rules change if you're watching live shows through these services, in which case you do need a TV licence.

National Insurance cut

Starting from April 6, National Insurance (NI) will be reduced by 2p, as previously announced by Mr Hunt. National Insurance is a tax on your earnings if you're employed or on your profits if you're self-employed.

From April 6, the initial rate for National Insurance will fall from 10 percent to 8 percent for 27 million workers. The chancellor says this will be worth about £450 a year to an employee earning an average salary of £35,000.

The chancellor is also reducing National Insurance for approximately two million self-employed workers, who will see their rate drop from 8 percent to 6 percent.

However, any reductions in National Insurance (NI) are likely to be significantly offset by existing policies that have frozen income tax and National Insurance thresholds - the levels at which people start paying these taxes - at £12,570. National Insurance thresholds used to increase annually, typically in line with inflation, but they are now frozen at their current levels for another four years until April 2028.

More people are being nudged into earning enough to start paying National Insurance (NI) and moving into higher tax brackets. This is particularly true as wages are set to rise in the coming weeks.

The Resolution Foundation think tank's analysis suggests that only those earning between £27,000 and £59,000 will be better off after the 2p cut comes in. This means millions of people earning below and above these salaries will still be worse off after the announcement.

State pension increase

From April 8, the state pension will increase by 8.5 percent, in line with the triple lock. This ensures pensioners' income rises in line with whichever is highest out of average earnings growth, inflation, or 2.5% per year.

The 8.5 percent figure is based on the September earnings growth figure and was confirmed by Mr Hunt in his autumn statement last year. The new weekly rates will be as follows:

Full new state pension: rising to £221.20 from £203.85 (an increase of £17.35 per week) Old or basic state pension: rising to £169.50 from £156.20 (an increase of £13.30 per week) Rise in state benefits

In the coming weeks, millions of people will see a rise in their benefit payments. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has confirmed that state benefits will increase by 6.7% from April 8.

This figure matches the consumer prices index (CPI) inflation rate in September 2023.

Almost all benefits will be affected by this increase, including universal credit, which is claimed by over 200,000 people in Wales, PIP, ESA, DLA, income support, and pension credit. You can check out all the new rates from April 2024 here, but it's worth noting that due to the way many benefits are paid each month, you might not see the full new rates reflected in your payments until a few weeks after April 8.

Around six million people in the UK claim universal credit, which is given to people on low incomes who are working or those who are out of work. State benefit rates change every year and 2024 will see most of them increase by 6.7 percent.

New flexible working rules

From April, employees will be allowed to request flexible working from their employer from day one of their job. Currently, those who have worked for their employer for 26 weeks or more have the right to ask if they can work flexibly.

But a new change in the law will make this a right that applies from the first day of employment.

A new law coming in from April will give stronger job rights to new mums and mums-to-be. This law will protect them from losing their jobs for a longer time during and after pregnancy or after periods of maternity, adoption, or shared parental leave.

Also from April, the Carer's Leave Act will allow unpaid carers to take extra unpaid time off work.

Being Greenwich, about five hands went up. I congratulated the early adopters of cleaner driving and then said, ""You know you're not paying for our highways... and that's not fair.""

It's true. Drivers of EVs are literally getting a free ride on our highways because they don't buy gasoline and therefore don't pay gas taxes, which are used to pay for the maintenance and repair of our roads.

Full disclosure: I drive a Prius hybrid that gives me double the mileage of my old Honda, so I'm half a freeloader, buying only half the gasoline I used to.

The point is... EV drivers should be paying for our roads just like everybody else. Why? Because EVs beat up our highways more than traditional internal combustion engine cars.

Due to their batteries, EVs are super heavy. A Tesla model X weighs over 5,000 pounds compared to the average American ICE which weighs 3,750 pounds. Heavier vehicles cause more damage to our roads than lighter ones and should pay accordingly.

Instead, EV buyers are given discounts. When you buy most new EVs you can get a $7500 tax credit, effectively lowering your purchase price. Many utility companies will also give you a rebate for installing a home charging system.

And don't forget that $7.5 billion in federal money is being used to build 500,000 commercial EV charging stations across the U.S., one every 50 miles on our interstates. Without those charging stations drivers won't buy EVs and we've already seen sales slow down this year as a result. In fact, it's the plug-in hybrid vehicles (that run on gasoline and electric) that are in hottest demand.

We need to encourage, not mandate by law, a conversion from gasoline to electric powered vehicles to preserve what's left of our environment.

But how to get EV owners, most of whom are presumably well-off financially if they can afford one, to pay their fair share for the roads they drive on?

Thirty states are now charging EV owners a registration fee of up to $400 to make up for their lost gasoline tax revenue. Other states are also adding a surcharge to electric bills: the bigger the EV, the more electricity it needs for the miles it drives, the more its owner will pay.

Of course, all this could change with the upcoming presidential election. The two candidates have sharply different views on EVs. But the states are still free to tax them as they wish.

As for Connecticut EV owners, good news. Our state's Special Transportation Fund has so much money from gasoline tax revenues that no EV tax is contemplated here... for now.",ctmirror.org,news,The CT Mirror,Jim Cameron,0.1529411764705881,448965175,1,https://i0.wp.com/ctmirror-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/evchargingstation-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,eng-9418000

She knew the time of her death in advance, ­having ­arranged to go to the ­Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. She knew too she had options - options that many people who don't have the considerable sums of money needed to ­follow her example do not.

Paola had terminal bowel cancer. She wasn't afraid of death, she said in a short film she made before travelling. She was afraid of dying in pain. She had already ­undergone ""brutal surgery"".

I had a friend who chose the same route.

She told me that had she understood how profoundly painful and distressing such major surgery would be, she wouldn't have gone ahead with it. As it was, it only allowed her a number of painful months ­before she, too, died.

As it happens, the latest attempt to bring an assisted dying bill before the Scottish Parliament should be formally introduced by LibDem MSP Liam McArthur before Holyrood goes into its Easter recess at the end of this week.

The late Margo MacDonald, who had Parkinson's disease, tried in vain to ­introduce assisted dying in 2010. The cause was picked up by Patrick Harvie in 2013. He was also unsuccessful.

Margo left us 10 years ago but remains one of the few politicians for whom a Christian name suffices for identification.

There are good reasons to suppose that McArthur's bill has a rather better chance of passing into law. For one thing, the medical profession's trade bodies mainly pronounce themselves neutral when once they were hostile.

The public too is supportive. During the three-month consultation process, more than three-quarters of the respondents were ­supportive of the bill.

Many of those opposed cited religious reasons, arguing that only their god should determine when we die. I'm not a ­believer, but I find it difficult to suppose a loving god would argue in favour of bad, painful death.

The Right To Life organisation mounted a campaign to oppose the bill. They might have been more successful had they not sent all the same similarly worded ­sentiments from the one email address.

It meant that these particular ­respondents could not be assumed to be individuals with a discrete opinion on the matter, rather an orchestrated response ­involving a circulated template.

I think it perfectly fair and ­reasonable that health professionals with a ­conscientious objection to assisted ­dying should not have to be part of the process in the same way as anti-abortionists' ­convictions should be respected.

Ditto parliamentarians in any of the UK parliaments.

What does not seem either fair or ­reasonable is that the views of less than a quarter of the public should be superimposed on the rest of the citizenry.

The responses to the consultation ­exercise often contained heart-rending tales of those who had to stand aside whilst those they loved died in pain and distress. I can relate to that. One of the last things my late mother said to me was, ""Nobody should have to suffer pain like this"". It haunts me to this day.

In the event, she died in hospital, thanks - I concluded - to what is known as ""­double effect"" palliative sedation. In plain ­English, given enough pain relief to hasten death.

Most people would like to fall off their perch suddenly and in their own bed. Most people don't. Invariably, they will contract some illness for which the ­treatment can involve unwanted side effects.

Usually, they spend their final hours in the embrace of the health service.

People opposed to allowing folk to ""take back control"" of their lives and their death cite many reasons - none of which seem to have happened in those many ­jurisdictions which now allow their citizens to determine the time and the method of dying.

None of these countries or states seem to have experienced an upsurge in the numbers taking advantage of the law in question. What seems to be the case is that those who have life-limiting ailments can have the comfort of knowing there is a legal backstop which they can utilise should their situation worsen.

That legal security blanket allows them to face the future without the gnawing fear of having to cope with what might become unbearable pain.

And that can and does happen, despite the very best efforts of those charged with dispensing palliative care to terminally ill patients. Sometimes the medicine isn't up to the task at hand. Sometimes the ­patient is beyond taking it.

Other opponents worry that some ­people might try to hasten their own ­demise rather than become a burden on their family or the health service. That particular concern is purely ­hypothetical and, again, does not seem to have any statistical basis where assisted dying is ­already available.

The disabled community has its own set of fears, worrying that they might be valued less by a society which practices assisted dying. They have high-profile champions like Olympic medallist Tanni Grey-Thompson - though I venture to ­suggest that particular baroness may have faced different challenges from those she now represents in this debate.

We certainly need, as a society, to give our disabled citizens a much better deal - and not least those who save the Government many billions by caring for them.

Curiously, whilst many respondents quite rightly want to see robust safeguards attached to any legislation, others worry that a diagnosis of terminal illness likely to result in death in a matter of months doesn't include those whose lives have become nigh-intolerable as a result of progressive disease.

Going down that road would be much more problematical, I'm guessing - not least as the imperative of keeping on ­living ­often seems to outweigh what ­others would regard as a loss of those qualities which make life desirable.

Was it the campaign to help other MND victims which kept the late ­Doddie Weir going long after he was ­incapable of ""­normal"" life? Or, more probably ­perhaps, was it down to the character and ­personality of the person concerned?

Art doesn't always imitate life, but sometimes it is a useful way of illustrating it. Many thousands of people who didn't read Andrew O'Hagan's masterful Mayflies were introduced to the assisted dying debate by the television mini-series based on it.

It concerned two lifelong friends, one of whom decided to take the same route as Paola Marra. And when Tully decides to take that final step, he challenges his pal ""Noodles"" to both accept the decision and celebrate it.

Both the book and the TV adaptation are tear-jerkers, but much leavened by a rich vein of humour and liberal use of the Scottish demotic.

Paola said that the most difficult part of the last few bureaucratic months, as she dealt with the paperwork necessary to progress her Swiss trip, was having to say farewell to her many friends.

Canadian by birth, she had lived for 35 years in the UK, so there would be no shortage of them.

In fact, she said, there were many people, she couldn't meet because of an increasingly packed diary. People will say she was brave. And she undoubtedly was.

But, just as importantly, she was ­pragmatic. She used what she knew would be a limited time to make sure her beloved dog had a new home, and her ­beloved friends felt valued.

The pity of it is that the one thing over which she had no control was being able to stay in her adopted home since it would have been illegal in the UK to arrange to end her life at a time of her choosing.

Hopefully Liam McArthur's bill will change that, as might similar legislation being proposed for the Commons. The Scottish Parliament likes to think itself progressive.

In 2014, Mireia Barba left her job as a Business Studies graduate to pursue her dream of creating a foundation that would combat food waste. At the call of a farmer who has just harvested or plans to leave a farm unpicked due to issues of weight, size or appearance of the product, the Fundació Espigoladors mobilizes its body of volunteers. In a matter of hours, they comb through those fields to collect hundreds of kilos of food that would otherwise rot in the sun.

Mireia did not imagine that just a decade after turning her life and career around, the organization she promoted would have 3,000 volunteers, recover more than 400 tons of food per year and distribute 1.3 million portions of food to people. vulnerable. In that same period of time, Espigoladors (the Catalan way of saying ""gleaners"", the traditional name for those who collected the fallen ears after harvesting) has promoted the Es im-perfect label, a canning workshop that has transformed 110,000 kilos of foods in jams, stir-fries, creams, jams or pâtés. And with this, it has saved the planet from the emission of 1,800 tons of CO2 and the consumption of 1,700 million liters of water.

Espigoladors settled in the Sant Cosme neighborhood of El Prat de Llobregat with a clear intention: to be near the Llobregat Delta Agrarian Park and, at the same time, in one of the most economically and socially vulnerable areas of the Barcelona metropolitan area. They took as inspiration the more than 300 earing associations that exist in the United States.

The operation is apparently simple, although it requires great strategic organization. Espigoladors closes agreements with producers who accept volunteers to collect surplus or non-marketable product. Organize teams of volunteers and immediately deliver the food to organizations such as the Food Bank, Cáritas, Red Cross, Solidarity Stores... and up to 94 social entities. ""We donate 100% of what we collect,"" declares Anna Gras, Head of Communication at Espigoladors.

At the same time, it has agreements with farmers to buy at favorable prices products that are too small or too large in size or that simply do not meet the aesthetic standards required by large distribution chains. Thus, artichokes with blackened outer leaves; pumpkins with spots on the skin; huge onions; carrots twisted instead of rocket straight; Plums, peaches or oranges with small defects... go directly to the Es im-perfect workshop, where they are turned into preserves.

""We employ around twenty people at risk of social exclusion who obtain a 3-year employment contract, are trained in food handling and transformation and, after that time, will be able to integrate into the conventional world of work,"" says Anna Gras. . ""At the end of their contract, the Social Services department of the El Prat de Llobregat town council will send us new candidates.""

Ideas boil in the modest offices that Espigoladors has in the Llobregat Delta. They have already extended their network to different Catalan regions and even monitored similar experiences in Navarra and Valencia. They admit, however, that there is not yet an organization in Spain with the implementation and impact that they have... although they would like it.

To become a volunteer gleaner you just have to sign up on their website and be willing to give a few hours to the service of food use and caring for the planet. Those who appear in the collaborator bags are mobilized by email and summoned to the farm in question. The number of volunteers is established depending on the hectares that need to be gleaned. Normally, a crew of 15-20 people can prepare a field in 3 hours in which 2,000 kilos of pumpkins are collected, for example. It is the volunteers who set their availability, although the days are preferably on weekdays and in the morning, to coordinate with the farmers.

This circumstance quite defines the typology of the volunteer gleaner. People with liberal professions, who work shifts or retirees. The profile: 60% are women over 60 years old who can attend the morning sessions. If it is on the weekend, young families with children appear and the atmosphere is different. In summer, when the hours of sunshine are generous and the heat is intense, gleanings can be organized starting in mid-afternoon. ""We carry out educational activities with young people to raise awareness about food waste. And by the way, for them to become voluntary gleaners, but they have borne specific fruits, it is difficult for them to get hooked on a continuous basis like the older ones do,"" Gras acknowledges.

Espigoladors has also begun to operate in the urban area. In 2021, it carried out a pilot experience to collect bitter oranges that hung from the street trees of Sant Andreu in Barcelona. The experience was so satisfactory that the city council of the Catalan capital has already granted them up to six districts for fruit collection. In the winter 2024 call, 600 people took part in the call, and several hundred who wanted to participate were left off the list. The oranges ended up turned into ""imperfect fruit jam,"" as they like to call it. By the way, Es-imperfect preserves are in the commercial circuit, and can be purchased in stores, as well as on the foundation's website.

One of the best-known collaborators of Espigoladors - and a member of the foundation's board - is chef Ada Parellada, continuator of a prestigious saga of Catalan chefs and visible head of the Semproniana restaurant in Barcelona. Every year she organizes several denunciation dinners made only with products that were destined for the trash can due to their appearance or size.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.08235294117647052,448964571,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_a4b2a.png,

The promoters of this initiative, led by the group Mighty Earth, demand a plan to reduce these emissions, arguing that in these sectors hardly any efforts have been made to combat warming.

This proposal has been formulated in the allegations presented to the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, where the Administration sets out its objectives for the decarbonization of the economy.

Mighty Earth, an international organization recently established in Spain, proposes that the Government set itself the goal of reducing methane emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 2020.

The request is directed especially at the agricultural and livestock sector as they generate large quantities of methane, which is the second greenhouse gas in volume after carbon dioxide (CO2), and with a warming potential 86 times greater than this. in a 20 year cycle.

The agricultural and livestock sector is responsible for 11.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Spain (2021 data) and is responsible for 62.7% of the methane thrown into the atmosphere.

And, within this area, the main focuses are the enteric fermentation of herbivores (belches and wind of cattle, especially), as well as pig or chicken farms and manure management. The other big focus is landfills.

The promoters of this initiative recall that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been insisting on the need to reduce emissions of methane and other gases if the temperature increase is to be contained below 1.5ºC.

And Spain signed the Global Commitment on Methane at the Glasgow climate summit (2021), although countries have shifted action towards methane reductions in the hydrocarbon extraction and transportation sector (leak control and so on). .

""It is very good to act in the field of hydrocarbons, but it is also key to do so in the field of agriculture, livestock and waste,"" says Carlos Bravo, representative of Mighty Earth in Spain and expert in public policies.

In their proposal to reduce methane emissions, these entities propose a progressive reduction in meat production levels, the promotion of healthy diets (vegetarian or with lower meat or dairy content) and the promotion of vegetable proteins.

""The Spanish Food Safety Agency recommends moderate consumption of meat since its continued and/or excessive consumption is related to health problems,"" says Carlos Bravo, representatives of Mighty Earth in Spain.

""Several studies have shown that methane reduction could be more easily achieved if EU citizens changed their diet to one with less meat and dairy consumption following national guidelines, which would lead to a reduction in the volume of livestock in the U. "", adds Carlos Bravo. These policies could mean a reduction of between 29% and 37% of the sector's methane emissions, according to the aforementioned allegations presented.

In December of last year, the European Commission made an evaluation of the updated draft of the National Energy and Climate Plan (Pniec) of Spain, and underlined precisely the shortcomings that Mighty Earth now reveals.

The Commission already warned then that the Pniec ""does not provide information on the implementation schedule, nor on the sources of financing"" related to measures to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector.

In addition, it was pointed out that the plan ""does not pay attention to methane emissions from enteric fermentation"" in the agriculture and livestock sector, despite ""which constitutes the largest source of emissions other than CO2,"" he points out, pointing out to methane from cattle and sheep.

The ""insufficient effort"" of these sectors is also considered worrying, according to the content of the Spanish long-term strategy aimed at achieving climate neutrality in 2050.

The scenarios drawn for the middle of the century foresee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions not from energy use for the primary sector, specifically 53% compared to the reference years (1990).

However, more of the emissions that would remain in 2050 will come from the agricultural and livestock sector, which for Bravo demonstrates the low ambition of this strategy.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,0.07450980392156858,448964564,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_78a19.png,eng-9414921

AI Legislation In the wake of escalating reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in various sectors, South Korea finds itself at a crossroads between fostering technological innovation and mitigating the potential risks associated with AI. The discourse around AI regulation has intensified with AI applications permeating daily life, from chatbots and translation services to recruitment processes. This comes against the backdrop of global movements towards tighter AI governance, highlighted by legislative developments in the European Union and executive actions in the United States.

The AI regulation debate in South Korea

As AI technologies become increasingly embedded in South Korean society, concerns over privacy, discrimination, and surveillance have sparked debate among policymakers, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the tech industry. The government's current legislative proposal to regulate AI has faced criticism for its perceived leniency towards industry growth over addressing the ethical and societal implications of AI deployment. Critics argue that the bill lacks comprehensive measures to ensure transparency, accountability, and protection against the misuse of AI technologies.

In response to the government's proposition, over 120 CSOs, led by prominent digital rights groups like Jinbonet, have vocalized their opposition. They advocate for a more stringent AI regulation framework that prioritizes human rights, safety, and democratic values. Their proposed AI bill encompasses a national supervision system, enhanced transparency, risk assessment protocols, and mechanisms for redressing violations. This initiative reflects a growing consensus among civil society actors on the need for preemptive measures to safeguard against the potential adverse impacts of AI.

AI Legislation and Public Opinion

The ongoing debate over AI regulation in South Korea is set against the broader context of global AI governance trends and domestic political dynamics. With the general election on the horizon, the outcome could significantly influence the future direction of AI legislation in the country. Civil society groups are gearing up to mobilize public support for their version of the AI bill, emphasizing the importance of addressing AI risks proactively.

As discussions continue, the contrast between the pro-industry stance and civil society's call for stringent regulations underscores the complexity of balancing innovation with ethical considerations. The outcome of this legislative debate will likely have far-reaching implications for the development and deployment of AI technologies in South Korea and beyond.

The discourse around AI regulation in South Korea highlights the critical need for a balanced approach that supports technological advancement while protecting against its potential downsides. As the country navigates this challenging landscape, the collaboration between government, industry, and civil society will be crucial in crafting legislation aligning with national interests and global standards for AI governance. With the general election approaching, the direction of AI policy in South Korea hangs in the balance, underscoring the importance of informed and inclusive decision-making in shaping the future of AI regulation.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Glory Kaburu,0.1764705882352942,448964558,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Default_Korean_Civil_Society_Challenges_AI_Legislation_Amid_Gr_1.jpg,eng-9419058

Disruption of VSD function can cause neurological disease such as epilepsy. VSDs contain positively charged amino acids that move in response to changes in membrane potential. This movement transfer energy to other coupled effectors, such as the pore of a voltage-gated ion channel. In this thesis, I have studied the physiology and regulation of ion-channel VSDs, as well as their role in disease.Voltage-gated ion channels are composed of four VSDs that controls the opening of a central ion-conducting pore. Voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels are tetramers assembled by four subunits, where each subunit consists of a VSD and 1/4 of the pore. In contrast, voltage-gated sodium (NaV) and voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels are pseudotetramers composed of four non-identical, concatenated subunits (repeats I-IV). Our genes encode a broad repertoire of voltage-gated ion channels, promoting diversity and specialization of neuronal subtypes. Specifically, 40 KV-, 9 NaV-, and 10 CaV-channels have been identified. This thesis includes studies on i) VSD operation in the CaV2.2 channel, known for its role in pain transmission, ii) G-proteins Gβγ inhibition of CaV2.2 VSDs, a potential tool to control pain, and iii) characterization of two different epilepsy-associated mutations in the VSD of the KV1.2 channel, important for repolarization of the action potential. To do this, the methods voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) under cut-open oocyte voltage clamp mode using Xenopus oocytes, or flow cytometry using a mammalian cell line (COS-7) were used.VCF was implemented in the human CaV2.2 channel and VSD activation in relation to pore opening was characterized. The voltage dependence of VSD-I activation was found to correlate with pore opening, VSD II is likely immobile (it did not generate any VCF signals), VSD III activated at very negative potentials, and VSD IV activation had similar voltagedependence to that of pore opening. Next, Gβγ-inhibition of the VSDs was explored. VSD I was strongly and proportionally inhibited compared to pore opening, VSD III was unaffected and VSD IV was modestly inhibited. In the following studies, the role of the KV1.2-VSD in disease was explored. Two different epilepsy-associated mutations in the VSD of KV1.2 were characterized. The first mutation, F302L, facilitated channel activation and spontaneous closure (inactivation) without affecting surface trafficking. The second mutation, F233S, caused a severe surface trafficking deficiency, extending to WT-subunits and closely related KV1.4 partner subunits. In conclusion, VSDs of ion channels are fundamental for the complexity of our nervous system, their regulation can be used to further diversify neurons or to control excitability, and their importance is revealed by disease-associated mutations that prevent normal function.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.04313725490196085,448964475,1,,

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately ¥860 million ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

Foreign players in Japan are classified as either residents or non-residents for tax purposes.

If their contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, they are classified as non-residents and pay less tax than residents, the reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members on a multi-year contract.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately ¥580 million as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company, cited by NHK and other media.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said.

Iniesta has paid back the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The management company could not immediately be reached to confirm the reports.

""I would estimate that billions of dollars of desperately needed foreign capital to support the build-to-rent sector is currently sitting on the sidelines awaiting the MIT rules,"" Mr Tarascio told The Australian Financial Review.

""It is unconscionable that in a housing crisis the government does not make the rules clear almost 12 months after a review was announced and just three months before it is due to be implemented.""

Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a reduction of the 30 per cent withholding tax rate on managed investment trusts in BTR in May's budget, but since then, has not published further details on how it would work, or whether the reduction would carry obligations such as an affordable housing component.

""The government announced detail of the policy in the budget and draft legislation will be released shortly,"" a spokesman for Mr Chalmers said on Sunday.

""The Albanese government has a broad and ambitious agenda to increase housing supply, including in the build-to-rent sector.""

The Property Council of Australia is lobbying for a reduced 10 per cent withholding tax rate to guarantee a minimum 5 per cent inclusion of affordable homes in BTR developments.

Views vary, however. Eddie Kutner, the executive chairman of Central Equity, a developer of traditional for-sale apartments, said that even with a concessional tax rate, BTR would remain a premium product.

""If you're looking for affordability, you won't find it in build-to-rent,"" Mr Kutner told the APDA event.

""Build-to-rent is predicated on achieving 5, 10, 15, 20 per cent above the market. And it has got some tax advantages which unfortunately build-to sell [apartments] haven't been able to achieve. And I'm not trying to take it away from build-to-rent. But it is also very counterintuitive that you give tax advantages to build-to-rent to institutions, and you don't give them to mums and dads, or young people on build-to-sell.""

Developers such as Salta, which has a pipeline of 4000 apartments, need capital from offshore to build the new asset class generally, but also to help them create portfolios of long-term rental housing assets of viable scale.

Christian Grahame, the head of BTR developer and operator Home, said the ""magic number"" to reach scale in a business he likened to hotel management was 5000 apartments.

""The sector can only grow commensurate with the rate of new capital coming into Australia,"" Mr Grahame told the same Australian Property Developers Association event.

""It has to come from foreign sources because the money doesn't get recycled, it sits in the asset.""

Many overseas pension and insurance funds have experience of the build-to-rent sector in their home markets and are more comfortable with the asset class than most Australian institutions, which are still getting used to it.

Last month, Macquarie Asset Management Real Estate-funded operator Local Residential secured a US investor to fully fund two BTR projects worth $650 million in inner-suburban Melbourne.

Mr Grahame said commercial BTR developments could include up to 5 per cent affordable, or key-worker, housing without lowering the overall return. Home's 360-unit BTR development in Melbourne's Richmond includes 14 affordable apartments.

""We can do it around the edges,"" Mr Grahame said. ""But if you're going to have more than, say 5 per cent, you need other incentives, you need wholesale incentives. Somehow you've got to rebalance that ledger to pay for it.""",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,0.08235294117647052,448964146,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.335%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_532%2C$y_150/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/2064285a1721744a1aeb10d1d814df6130187550,

Baramati:

Leaders from Opposition parties are not going to the BJP because they like its ideology, but because of ""ICE - Income Tax, CBI and ED"", three-time MP Supriya Sule told NDTV today. Ms Sule, daughter of veteran politician Sharad Pawar, is set to contest again from the Baramati parliamentary constituency that she has represented since 2009. A family stronghold, the seat was earlier represented by Mr Pawar from 1996 to 2009.

This election, however, is different. Between the last election and this one, Sharad Pawar's NCP has split - one faction is led by the octogenarian and the other by his nephew Ajit Pawar, who has tied up with the BJP and Shiv Sena and joined the Maharashtra government. Ms Sule will now be contesting as a candidate of NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), the faction led by the veteran.

And the battle for Baramati this time, it is learnt, may see a Pawar vs Pawar contest. Ajit Pawar's wife and environmental activist Sunetra Pawar is likely to take on her sister-in-law Supriya on the key seat.

Asked about this, Ms Sule replied, ""I don't know who is contesting against me because it has not been announced officially. I will tell you once that happens.""

Asked about the poll prospects of the INDIA alliance, especially in the wake of AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's arrest and split in Opposition parties, she said, ""Democracy is being murdered. The ones who went to BJP did not do so out of love. They went because of ICE - Income tax (department), CBI and ED. The BJP had raised a storm over Ashok Chavan. And now they have taken him in. This is how they are breaking parties. This is not politics, this is murder of democracy.""

Mr Chavan, a former Maharashtra Chief Minister who was formed to resign over allegations of corruption, quit the Congress and joined the BJP last month.

The focus is on deregulation of electricity retail markets and on the continued regulation of parts of such markets after the introduction of competition. The first essay is an empirical essay on the causes of deregulation. The timing of implementation of competition in retail electricity markets in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand is studied. One conclusion is that there exist important qualitative differences between the United States and Europe. While deregulation in the United States to a large extent seems to have been driven by consumer interest concerns, the influence from interest groups is more pronounced in Europe.The second (theoretical) and third (empirical) essays deal with the interaction between the regulation of distribution networks and the retail market. When the regulated and unregulated operations are conducted within vertically integrated companies the regulation may not only have an effect on the regulated market, but also affect the behavior in the unregulated market. In the third essay a test that uses prices to detect patterns of cross-subsidization is developed and used on Norwegian data. Especially the effects of a regulatory change on cross-subsidization behavior are analyzed. The results both highlight the importance of a well-designed regulation of the regulated market and give support to requirements of vertical separation between regulated and unregulated operations.The fourth essay is a study of domestic electricity demand. It is thus somewhat different than the other papers since it is not directly connected to the issue of electricity market deregulation. Since the energy sector is an essential part of any modern economy and energy production has considerable environmental effects, the sector has for a long time been subject to political interventions. To some extent the policy instruments available to the legislator are reduced by deregulations. The use of taxes to affect prices and thus the demand for electricity may at the same time become an even more important policy instrument and more difficult to implement due to the internationalization of the electricity market.",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.223529411764706,448963603,1,,

Compost your kitchen scraps,"An open bin like the one pictured here works well for garden waste, but don't use it for kitchen waste. Evan Lorne/Shutterstock

I was shocked to read last month that food waste is estimated to be 40 percent of the solid waste handled by public disposal systems in Maine. (Roughly the same percentage is said to hold true nationwide.)

That statistic appeared in a newspaper article about legislation to ban food waste from solid-waste-disposal sites in Maine. The bill as now proposed would exempt households from the ban. I think that's unfortunate. Household composting is easy if you have even a tiny plot of land where you grow flowers or vegetables.

My wife and I do two types of composting: from the garden and from the kitchen. Leaves and other garden waste are easy to compost because they don't attract wildlife. Such compost is perfectly safe in the open bin I created by tying together recycled wooden pallets. Compost from household food waste, though, must be covered. Otherwise, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, woodchucks, rats and other critters would feed on the scraps, making a mess and spreading the scraps around your yard.

Several years ago, we purchased a compost bin from Cape Elizabeth's public works department. Though that program has ended, you can buy composters at most garden centers. Look for ones with ventilation and a lid that fastens on.

Our kitchen scraps make several stops on the way to the bin. My wife Nancy cuts gallon plastic milk jugs to keep the handle but allow a large opening for scraps. We keep the jug in the kitchen sink, then transfer the scraps to two (five-gallon) pails that live in the garage. When the pails are full, I empty them into our outdoor bin. In years past, when we had heavy snow, I could wait up to three weeks before making a trip to the bin, but snow has not been a problem for the past few years, and I walk out whenever I need a bit of exercise and fresh air.

If you read about home composting, you'll find lots of advice telling you not to put meat scraps, bones, seafood shells, cheese and other animal products in your compost. It's said that animal products take too long to break down into usable compost and furthermore will attract wildlife. I haven't found the latter to be true. Our closed bin keeps any animals away, especially since I keep bricks or stones by the ventilation holes and against the area where I remove the compost.

Also, meat scraps, bones and such do break down eventually, and they create fine compost. Anyway, I am in no rush to get it. Some of our waste goes through multiple cycles. When the bin gets full, I open the bottom, remove the compost with a trowel, sift out anything that has not completely broken down and put that back into the top of the bin. The rest I spread in the vegetable garden, turning the soil with a spading fork to incorporate it into the soil.

The items that most commonly need two trips through the compost cycle are lobster, clam and mussel shells, also the occasional bones from steak or pork chops. I think the seafood shells are worth the effort. Several commercial compost products tout them as they add nutrients and trace minerals to the compost. The coffee filters from our drip coffee pot also require multiple runs, but the grounds themselves decompose quickly.

We also compost paper and cardboard that has been contaminated by food so that it can't recycled -- things like takeout containers and grocery-store packaging.

I remove compost from the bottom of my bin only when it's too full to add more food scraps. Usually, that's about now, when the material has thawed out; and in mid-summer and after Thanksgiving (the holiday produces a lot of food waste the years we host) before any chance of freezing.

The non-food compost also goes into the vegetable garden. When I pull early-season crops like peas, I put down compost so the soil won't be bare. After the first frost I spread the rest of the compost, concentrating on the areas where I plan to grow heavy feeders such as squash and potatoes. I use a hoe to mix it into the soil.

The whole process takes some time, but it isn't a lot of work. And it is more environmentally friendly than sending food scraps to landfills or incinerators. Add to this, you'll save some money by reducing, if not eliminating, the amount of commercial compost you have to buy.

We also compost paper and cardboard that has been contaminated by food so that it can't recycled -- things like takeout containers and grocery-store packaging.

I remove compost from the bottom of my bin only when it's too full to add more food scraps. Usually, that's about now, when the material has thawed out; and in mid-summer and after Thanksgiving (the holiday produces a lot of food waste the years we host) before any chance of freezing.

The non-food compost also goes into the vegetable garden. When I pull early-season crops like peas, I put down compost so the soil won't be bare. After the first frost I spread the rest of the compost, concentrating on the areas where I plan to grow heavy feeders such as squash and potatoes. I use a hoe to mix it into the soil.

The whole process takes some time, but it isn't a lot of work. And it is more environmentally friendly than sending food scraps to landfills or incinerators. Add to this, you'll save some money by reducing, if not eliminating, the amount of commercial compost you have to buy.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

If a foreign player's contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, Japanese authorities classify them as non-residents and they pay less tax than residents, reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members and was on a multi-year contract.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said in the statement, obtained by AFP on Sunday.

Iniesta has now paid the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The Osaka regional taxation bureau declined to comment when contacted by AFP.

News agency Kyodo reported last week that South Korea goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyeon and Brazilian forward Patric had also failed to declare their income properly in Japan.

Cerezo Osaka keeper Kim has been ordered to pay 220 million yen in back taxes and Patric, previously at Gamba Osaka and currently at Nagoya Grampus, 210 million yen, Kyodo said.

One woman in Hà Nội admitted that she did not remember how many cards she had activated, but now she only used two cards and accounts.

All banks have tried to increase market share of credit cards as investment in this segment brings big profits because interest rates are higher than regular loans. Card fees, such as annual fees, cash withdrawal fees and overdue debt fines, bring a large and very stable source of revenue for banks.

Banks have rushed to issue cards to expand market share, regardless of whether customers need to use them or not. Banks have continuously offered preferential policies to attract and retain customers to use credit cards, such as cashback at shopping locations, cash rewards for high spending, free suitcases and exemption from annual fees for customers in the following year if their spending reaches the required levels.

Meanwhile, customers do not hesitate to activate cards as this can be done online easily. This is one of the reasons for banks' rampant card issue, which has caused waste and many other consequences.

Phạm Anh Tuấn, Director of the SBV's Payment Department, admitted that in recent times, many banks had been quite easy going in activating credit cards.

Despite the indiscriminate junk cards, there is currently no legal regulation to cancel cards that are not being used.

Currently, each bank has its own regulations on handling junk cards. At Agribank, an account and card, which does not have enough minimum balance of VNĐ50,000 for individual customer and VNĐ1 million for institutional customer, and inactive within 12 months, will be put into sleeping account mode. Then, Agribank will close the account and card if the account and card is still inactive in the next 36 months.

However, banks can only close accounts and cards with a balance of zero đồng. For accounts that still have even VNĐ1, banks cannot close. In fact, there are many such accounts.

Therefore, industry insiders proposed the management authorities should issue legal regulations on closing junk cards. -- VNS",vietnamnet.vn,news,VietNamNet News,,0.3098039215686275,448963102,1,https://static-images.vnncdn.net/files/publish/2024/3/24/338375-card-491.jpg,

RJ Davis scored 20 points to help UNC beat the Spartans 85-69 on Saturday, pushing the Tar Heels to the Sweet 16 while keeping them unbeaten in March Madness against Izzo's teams in a series going back 26 years.

Harrison Ingram made five 3-pointers and scored 17 points for the West Region's top seed, which continued its NCAA success in its home state. The Tar Heels (29-7) improved to 5-0 in the tournament against Izzo, including victories in the 2005 Final Four and 2009 title game.

And they move on to the regional semifinals in Los Angeles, where they will face either Grand Canyon or Alabama on Thursday night.

It started with answering the Spartans' game-opening punch that put the Tar Heels in a 12-point hole. The response -- continuing coach Hubert Davis' season-long message -- was a game-defining change. The Tar Heels erased the Spartans' lead and answered every push that followed.

""We came into the huddle and said, 'Look, we can't talk about any basketball stuff until we join the fight,'"" Hubert Davis said. ""Once that started, the level of play in terms of the energy and effort, the attention to detail rose. Then that's when things started to change.""

UNC ran off 17 straight points during a 23-3 run over the last eight minutes of the first half. And that secured the program's largest comeback in March Madness since rallying from 16 down to beat Southern California in the 2007 Sweet 16.

""I think being able to continue to trust each other, our ability to execute, to continually raise the level of energy,"" said UNC's Cormac Ryan, who had 14 points. ""That starts with guys coming in and making individual effort and energy plays, and that happened all across the board all night.""

UNC fifth-year post Armando Bacot (18 points) was critical, getting inside to score, draw fouls or kick out against oncoming double teams. Ingram was on the receiving end of some of those, hitting 5 of 7 3-pointers to go with seven rebounds.

Tyson Walker scored 24 points for the ninth-seeded Spartans (20-15), who were playing in front of a blue-clad crowd about a 2 1/2-hour drive from UNC's Chapel Hill campus.

Izzo had no explanation when asked Friday about the lack of postseason success against UNC, a blip on a resume featuring 26 straight trips to March Madness, eight Final Fours and the 2000 national title. This one ended the same as the previous matchups and was the third in the Tar Heels' home state.

""I'll just say hats off to Carolina and Hubert and their team, but I'm not going to hang my head because I don't believe it was a 16-point loss,"" Izzo said. ""So many ebbs and flows that were monstrous in that game.""

To Izzo's point, one of Ingram's 3s seemed destined to miss when it caught iron, only to somehow take a soft lap all the way around the rim and drop through the net -- sending Ingram screaming toward the bench and giving UNC a 69-57 lead with 6:18 left.

""I thought it was going in because I felt the rim was huge,"" Ingram said. ""I was jumping up and down, praying to God it went in.""

That came minutes after RJ Davis had banked in a straightaway 3 while trying to lose a defender, a moment that had the first-team AP All-American looking to the rafters in disbelief.

By then, the Spartans were already chasing.

Michigan State carried the action early behind a heater of a start with Walker scoring 11 points in the first 10 1/2 minutes. And when Malik Hall scored on a pivot spin against Jae'Lyn Withers inside, the Spartans led 28-17 at the 8:08 mark. That's when the Tar Heels matched the Spartans' edge.

Ingram hit a 3 to start the 17-0 burst that included multiple baskets and free throws from Bacot. Ryan nailed another 3 from the corner in a side-reversing sequence that started inside with Bacot, while Ingram hit another that pushed the Tar Heels to a 40-31 lead at the break.

BIG PICTURE

Michigan State: It was a bumpy season for a team that opened the season ranked No. 4 in the AP Top 25 but was unranked before the end of November and remained that way the rest of the year. The Spartans had wins against NCAA 3-seeds Illinois and Baylor, but they didn't have better than a three-game winning streak after the start of 2024 and had lost five of seven entering March Madness. They beat eighth-seeded Mississippi State on Thursday, but -- in a repeat of their season-long inconsistency -- couldn't sustain their edge for 40 minutes.

""It made it frustrating because I kept saying to myself I know this team has enough,"" Izzo said. ""You know what, I'll leave today believing I'm right. I really think we have enough that we could have made a little run. Yeah, we would have had to get them past a mountain, but we had them down. ... We just couldn't get over the hump.""

UNC: The Tar Heels advanced by beating 16th-seeded Wagner with an easy dominance in the paint against an undersized team. They had a tougher fight in this one but improved to 36-2 in NCAA games in North Carolina, including 14-1 in Charlotte, the state's largest city.

UP NEXT

The Tar Heels learn their opponent Sunday. UNC owns an 8-5 record against the fourth-seeded Crimson Tide and has never met the 12th-seeded Antelopes.

Shesterkin also made four saves in overtime and improved to 10-3-1 in his last 14 games. He also reached the 30-win mark for the third straight season.

""It was a great game. It came down to a shootout,'' Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""It's always good to get that extra point.""

Tkachuk opened the scoring at 8:18 of the first, tipping Josh Mahura's shot past Shesterkin. Luostarinen made it 2-0 just 21 seconds into the second on a setup by Reinhart, who leads the Panthers with 80 points.

Fox narrowed the deficit on the power play at 6:22 of the second before Panarin scored at 8:23 of the middle period from a sharp angle to tie the game at 2.

Panarin had a hat trick in Thursday's 5-2 win at Boston and has 99 points this season. The 32-year-old Russian forward is trying to become the first Ranger to reach 100 points since Jaromir Jagr in 2005-06 and the seventh to reach the milestone.

""He had another monster game,'' Laviolette said. ""He gives his all every shift.""

""I look at it from a regulation point of view because there is no three-on-three or shootout in the playoffs,'' Maurice said. ""We came in on the road banged up, and I wouldn't say riding a whole lot of confidence. And we were pretty good tonight. I'm pretty happy.""

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

If a foreign player's contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, Japanese authorities classify them as non-residents and they pay less tax than residents, reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members and was on a multi-year contract.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said in the statement, obtained by AFP on Sunday.

Iniesta has now paid the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The Osaka regional taxation bureau declined to comment when contacted by AFP.

News agency Kyodo reported last week that South Korea goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyeon and Brazilian forward Patric had also failed to declare their income properly in Japan.

Cerezo Osaka keeper Kim has been ordered to pay 220 million yen in back taxes and Patric, previously at Gamba Osaka and currently at Nagoya Grampus, 210 million yen, Kyodo said.

NALGONDA: The state government has issued orders stopping the subsidy for some vehicles in the T-PRIDE (Telangana State Programme for Rapid Incubation of Dalit Entrepreneurs) incentives scheme introduced by the Industries department under the BRS regime in 2015. The scheme was introduced with the intention of employing many SC, ST, and disabled people as part of a self-employment initiative.

Male beneficiaries of the scheme were eligible for a 35% subsidy and women were eligible for a 45% subsidy to set up small-scale industries or purchase lorries, cars and other goods vehicles for self-employment.

The scheme ran properly for four years with SC, ST and disabled youth purchasing four-wheelers and plying taxis. However, the BRS government stopped releasing the subsidy amount for the last five years and the beneficiaries suffered financial losses.

When Congress came to power, the beneficiaries across the district approached the MLAs and sought the release of the subsidy amounts. The government then decided to review the scheme. While the scheme is being implemented by the Industries department, it was brought to the notice of the government that more people have applied for cars and other taxi vehicles than for setting up industries.

The Congress government then ordered to stop the subsidy for cars and other taxi vehicles allotted under the T-PRIDE incentive scheme. It was decided to give priority to the establishment of industries under the scheme. The government made it clear that those who have applied for vehicles will get the subsidy but this will stop in the coming financial year.",newindianexpress.com,news,The New Indian Express,https,0.0117647058823529,448959791,1,https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-03%2F775708c7-1e10-477c-8254-26d376010405%2Fvehicles.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,

This happens whether or not income growth puts taxable income into a higher marginal rate bracket.

Historically, governments of both stripes have allowed this mechanism to keep going until average rates - and marginal rates at average incomes - became so high that the burden became politically intolerable. This is when we finally get tax cuts.

One important test of such cuts is how much they do to offset past bracket creep.

On this issue, various claims were made about the Coalition government's three-stage personal income tax plan that began in 2018-19 and was to be completed this July.

The focus has always been on stage three; how it delivered a $9000 gain to high-income earners and allegedly over-compensated them for bracket creep.

This was despite stage one concentrating tax cuts on lower incomes, and high incomes not receiving significant relief from bracket creep since 2010-11.

Simple comparisons of average tax rates in 2024-25 with those in 2017-18 - just before the tax cut plan started - did reveal a reduction in average rates from around $90,000 compared with seven years ago.

However, such calculations fail to take into account the extra tax paid in each of those years as a result of bracket creep. Indeed, this failure of measurement applies at all income levels.

Using a more comprehensive methodology, CIS research has recalculated the cumulative effect of bracket creep and discretionary tax cuts over those seven years and found that even under the Coalition's original plan, the main beneficiaries of tax policy since 2017-18 have been those on incomes between $50,000 and $224,000.

Far from ""$9000 gifts to the rich"", those with incomes above $224,000 are slightly worse off over the period - and that's if they had received the original stage three tax cuts in full.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts

The Albanese government's re-design of stage three lowers the range of incomes that have been over-compensated for bracket creep to around $48,500-$214,000, and also delivers a cut to those on $34,000-$39,700 they would not otherwise have received.

However, if we look back further to 2010-11 - the year the last major tranche of tax cuts were fully implemented - the results are dramatically different.

The Coalition's three-stage plan undercompensates everyone above $35,000; while Labor's revision increases the extent of undercompensation above about $146,000 and slightly reduces it below that level.

The conclusion is that while any government is free to shape the distribution of a tax cut as it sees fit, relief from bracket creep is one important criterion, which provides no justification for the Albanese government's stage three renovations.

As a result, the bottoms of the 37 per cent and 45 per cent brackets ($135,000 and $190,000) will become pressure points sooner than otherwise.

Second, to the extent some taxpayers are being over-compensated for past bracket creep, future bracket creep will eventually devour that benefit.

The government's stage three tinkering might buy those taxpayers who benefit some more time, but not much.

Third, if thresholds were indexed to inflation annually, relatively small reductions to tax would be made each year thereby avoiding the accumulation of revenue to fund larger but illusory ""tax cuts"" every several years.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts - not merely the return of the additional money the government had taken in previous years.

And fourth, if indexation is not adopted in future (and there is no sign that it will be) there has to be a better understanding that under the practice of widely spaced discretionary tax cuts, larger absolute dollar cuts at higher incomes are necessary unless average tax rates are to increase inexorably above a certain income level.

Over time, that ""certain"" level will become lower in real terms, capturing an increasing number of taxpayers; with all that implies for the effect of the tax system on incentive and aspiration.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,-0.1843137254901961,448958849,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2856%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/339ac969c87b7c54a552aa731bba749a46922fda,eng-9411982

The MCA will supplement the match fees provided by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from next season.

This initiative will see Mumbai players receive two separate salaries of equal amounts. Unlike in limited-overs cricket, domestic red-ball matches do not entail designated match fees; instead, players are remunerated based on the number of days they participate.

The MCA is set to become the first association in India to introduce a match fee for players, supplementing the BCCI's existing structure. The current pay structure varies based on a player's experience, with amounts ranging from INR 40,000 to INR 60,000 per day.

Mumbai Cricket Association Will Be Paying Additional Match Fees - Amol Kale

During the MCA's Apex Council meeting on Saturday, March 23, it was decided to match the BCCI's daily allowance for players. MCA President Amol Kale emphasized the importance of increasing player earnings, particularly for those involved in the Ranji Trophy.

""MCA will be paying additional match fees per Ranji Trophy game to each player from next season onwards. For example if a new player is earning Rs 40,000 per day from the BCCI then MCA will pay them Rs 40,000 too. We felt that players should earn more, especially those who play Ranji Trophy cricket. For us red-ball cricket matters the most as Ranji Trophy holds a special place for everyone in Mumbai,"" Amol Kale told the Indian Express.

The MCA Recognises The Pivotal Role - Ajinkya Naik

The MCA will have to spend approximately INR 2.5-3 crore per player to implement the new initiative. Despite the increased financial commitment, the decision has garnered unanimous support from the Apex Council, reflecting widespread approval of the move.

In an effort to enhance the status of red-ball domestic cricket in the country, the BCCI has also established a three-member committee. This committee includes Team India head coach Rahul Dravid, NCA head VVS Laxman, and chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar.

Mumbai clinched their first Ranji Trophy title in eight years with a commanding 169-run victory over Vidarbha in the final match.

This year, he announced a rise of about 32 per cent (80 HK cents per cigarette), taking the price of a pack of cigarettes to more than HK$90.

Research has shown that taxation is a powerful tool for reducing smoking among low-income groups. Those who smoke a pack a day would end up spending almost HK$3,000 (US$384) a month, a substantial sum of money, especially for low-income workers. They would surely need to cut back.

According to the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health, after the tobacco tax increase was announced in the budget on February 28, the weekly average number of people calling its hotline needing help with quitting smoking rose by nearly four times compared to three months ago.

Some have criticised the raising of the tax, saying that it would drive chain smokers to pirated cigarettes. I myself had been a chain smoker for more than 40 years.

In a first, the LSGD has proposed to the State Election Commission to instruct MCC squads to coordinate with local bodies and Haritha Karma Sena (KHKS) members and hand over the illegal campaign materials for scientific disposal.

During previous elections, MCC squads used to dump illegal campaigning materials at the removal site, said officials.

""It's a huge burden for the local bodies. The squads often remove the campaign materials, including banners and materials, and irresponsibly dump them around. Collection and disposal of waste is a huge task for the local bodies. We have submitted the recommendations to the Election Commission and are waiting for the commission to come out with an order so that we can give necessary directions to the local self-government institutions,"" said the official.

LSGD Minister M B Rajesh told TNIE that the special squads should responsibly hand over poll-related waste to local bodies. ""It's not about enforcement and I would say all political parties should follow a code of conduct for themselves, adhere to green protocol and use eco-friendly materials for election campaigning. Recyclable materials should be used and after the elections, they should recycle these materials and convert them into valuable products,"" the minister said.

He said that the anti-defacement squads should hand over poll waste to respective local bodies so that they can handle it along with other waste in a proper manner. The other day, the office of the Chief Electoral Officer in Kerala released a handbook on the green protocol to be followed strictly by the campaigners and election officials during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. As per the recommendations, propaganda boards and banners should be made of cotton and paper and eco-friendly materials should be used to decorate election offices of political parties.

The district election officers have been directed to take legal action if prohibited materials are found to be used. ""We have given strict instructions to avoid the use of single-use plastic and disposable items. We were able to reduce the generation of waste considerably after the introduction of green protocol during previous elections held in the state,"" said an official of Suchitwa Mission.

She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

'Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,' said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's 'still happy we have our cows.'

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third-largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

FILE - A man walks holding an umbrella past a cow at a farm adjacent to a residential apartment complex in Kochi, southern Kerala state, India, June 11, 2022.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with more than 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

'Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,' said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. 'These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,' he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

'Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,' she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

'Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,' said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

'You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,' he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

'In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,' Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

'The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,' she said.",northernirelandnews.com,news,Northern Ireland News,,0.2,448957903,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/voa1711260357.jpg,

Speaking at the Dewan Negara, he said that the only way to boost the economy of Labuan is to make Labuan welcome to investors.

""Currently, only 23 types of businesses governed by Labuan Financial Services Authority (LFSA) enjoy a 3 percent tax rate. Why not extend this privilege to all businesses in Labuan. That way, people will come in and invest in Labuan, spurring the economy,"" said Anifah in a statement.

""Back then, Labuan was a fully duty free island. Now there have been many changes in policies made by the previous government.

""It's current status as a restricted duty free island is one of the reasons of the poor economic conditions there,"" he said further.

He added that allowing a 3 percent tax rate on all businesses can be a stepping stone towards making the island a fully tax-exempt island.

The poor economic conditions and the difficulties in finding jobs on the island have caused people to call for Labuan to be returned to the Sabah State Government because people feel like they have been sidelined by the Federal Government.

""People in Labuan feel like they are step sons and daughters. Labuan was supposed to be developed like the other federal territories but it wasn't"", he added.

Meanwhile, Anifah also spoke on the importance of upholding the Federal Constitution to ensure its full implementation for the benefit of Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan.

He added that this was in accordance with the recent Royal Address by His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ibrahim ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar who convened the opening of the third session of the 15th Parliament.

""It is important to adhere to the Federal Constitution as the supreme law of the nation,"" said Anifah, whose sentiments was echoed by fellow Senator Datuk Dr. Mujahid Yusof Rawa.

Drawing attention to specific provisions within the Federal Constitution, Anifah pointed out Article 112C and Schedule 10, which stipulate that the federal government must allocate 40% of federal revenue collections to the state governments of Sabah and Sarawak.

""The interim payment of RM300 million to the Sabah government is very welcome.

""However, what else are we waiting for? The Constitution is clear. The 40% is clear,"" he added, raising concerns regarding the ongoing discussions on the implementation mechanism.

Anifah also asked the Federal Government to allow the Sabah State Government to issue it's own manufacturing licence for investments of up to RM100 million.

""Currently, the Sabah State Government can only issue State Government Approvals for investments below RM2.5 million.

""Do you know that the cost to set up a McDonald's is already RM2.8 million?

""So can't Sabah approve manufacturing licenses above RM2.5 million?"" he added.

Andres Iniesta has reportedly paid back extra tax owed in Japan over failure to declare part of his income, but claimed that he had also declared the earnings in Spain.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

Foreign players in Japan are classified as either residents or non-residents for tax purposes.

If their contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, they are classified as non-residents and pay less tax than residents, the reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members on a multi-year contract.

He was issued with an additional tax demand of approximately 580 million yen as a result.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company, cited by NHK and other media.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said.

Iniesta has paid back the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

Following the recent increase in payments for Test cricketers, the BCCI is now considering a similar incentive scheme for participants in the Ranji Trophy. A BCCI official revealed this development, stating that the board is exploring ways to reward players involved in red-ball Ranji Trophy cricket. The intention is to boost match fees to emphasise the significance of red-ball cricket.

""After the Test Cricket Incentive Scheme, the BCCI is working out how we can reward players who play red-ball Ranji Trophy cricket. The BCCI is planning to increase the match fees to give more importance to red-ball cricket,"" a BCCI official told The Indian Express.

Currently, Ranji Trophy players receive match fees ranging from INR 40,000 to INR 60,000 per day, depending on the number of matches played during the season. However, this pales in comparison to even the lowest base price of INR 20 lakh for an IPL player participating in two months of T20 cricket.

This move comes as players increasingly prioritize IPL commitments over domestic tournaments, with many IPL-contracted players opting out of Ranji Trophy matches to mitigate injury risks or maintain fitness for the lucrative T20 league.

Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone: R Ashwin

Indian cricketer R Ashwin has expressed his backing for the BCCI's emphasis on prioritising Test cricket. He emphasized the importance of Test cricket, stating that the board aims to promote it and expects eligible individuals to participate in this format.

""Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone, it might not work in favour of everyone, it might be detrimental to a few people. What we must understand here is the message being conveyed by the organisational body... that we are prioritising Test cricket, IPL is not everything as far as we are concerned. They are saying Test cricket is paramount...we are going to promote it and we expect people eligible top lay this format. In my view, they are making the right noises,"" Ashwin said as quoted by Indian Express.

Ashwin also acknowledged players' autonomy in choosing their preferred formats, stating, ""At the same time, whether a cricketer wants to do all the 12 months, or only wants to do the two months or whether they want to be relevant playing T20 cricket and one-day cricket and do not want to be playing Test cricket, is their choice.""",crictracker.com,news,CricTracker,,0.4431372549019608,448955441,1,https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1710409131054_ranji.jpeg,eng-9420396

These were the words of Adapt's Sidwell Sehoana during a media and stakeholders briefing at the pro-bono offices of the ENSafrica at Alex Mall. He added incidents of gender-based violence and murders in the township have taken a downward spiral.

Although there is still a lot of work to be done on the ground, Sehoana said they were able to take solace in the fact that their programmes undertaken by the Masiphephe Network of organisations that work in the GBV space, had identified alcohol as the major contributor to incidents of GBV, murders and sexual offences in the township.

""Most cases of GBV that we have handled over the years, including murders, were committed when people have had one drink too many. We then sought the support of the Alex SAPS and the courts in our area to join us in fighting these alcohol-related crimes and now we are beginning to see those dividends,"" Sehoana said.

The partnership's immediate task was to clamp down on the liquor trading outlets in the township by shutting down all illegal taverns, shebeens and pop-up liquor traders. ""We have since our clampdown programme started in 2023, closed more than 140 illegal liquor traders and we are witnessing a decline in sexual offences and murders as well.""

Sehoana said the decline of these crimes also speaks to the calibre of the SAPS leadership that exists now at the station and their determination to fight all forms of crimes plaguing the township.

All you need to know about city's £40 garden waste service,"From April 1 residents across the city will have to fork out £40 per year to get their garden waste collected. Earlier this month, Stoke-on-Trent City Council voted to make its garden waste collection service an opt-in paid-for subscription scheme.

It is one of 41 cuts and savings approved in the council's 2024/25 budget. The authority had previously charged £15 to collect garden waste between November and April.

The city council carried out its last free brown bin collection service on March 18. From April Fool's Day, residents will have to start paying.

If you've got questions about the new paid-for service - such as whether you can share a bin or if there are any concessions - scroll down to find out all you need to know ahead of the launch on April 1.

Why do councils charge for garden waste collections?

Not everyone needs or uses the current garden waste collection service and making it a self-funding service enables us to provide the service for only those who want it. There is no legal obligation for councils to collect garden waste free of charge. Over 70% of all local authorities in England now charge for garden waste collections as a non-essential, opt-in service.

What are the alternatives to garden waste collections?

People who do not wish to use the garden waste service may also wish to consider home composting. You can also take your garden waste to your local Household Waste Recycling Centre (the tip). Utilise the free disposal option at either of the two Household Waste Recycling Centres. Locations listed below:

Hanford, Campbell Rd, Hanford, Stoke-on-Trent ST4 4DX Federation Road, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent ST6 4HU

Why is there a charge for garden waste collections?

While some people value garden waste collections, others don't want or require it. To ensure this is fair, this is a chargeable, opt-in service. Residents can decide if they would like to receive garden waste collections or not, and only those who do so pay an annual charge and fund the service.

How much does it cost?

The annual garden waste service costs £40 per annum/per bin. Collections will take place fortnightly with a break during the Christmas period.

Why £40?

We have benchmarked against other local authorities before proposing the £40 charge for garden waste collection; the annual charge is comparable.

How do I subscribe and when by?

You can subscribe and pay online by credit or debit card by following this link: Garden Waste Subscriptions. You are encouraged to sign up for the service as soon as possible to maximise on collections. The annual charge of £40 per bin runs from April 2024 until the end of March 2025. There is no reduction in cost if you join later in the year.

How will you know I have subscribed and who hasn't?

You will receive a sticker to put on your bin to show that you have registered for the service. Your sticker should arrive 10 working days after you subscribe. Our in-cab technology on our collection vehicles also gives up to date information to the waste collection crews, so if your sticker has been delayed then our crew will still know if you have subscribed.

Can I share a garden waste bin with a neighbour?

Yes, if you and a neighbour wish to share, then one of you will need to pay the charge and you can arrange between yourselves how you split the use of the subscribed bin. We are not responsible for any agreements that you enter into with your neighbour.

Can I have more than one garden waste bin?

Yes, if you would like further bins they will be at a charge of £40 per bin. There will also be an additional annual subscription charge of £40 per bin. You will receive a sticker per bin.

I only use my garden waste bin in the summer - can I just pay for the months that I use it?

No, the garden waste service is an annual subscription charge of £40.

Can I have a smaller bin or a new bin?

If you subscribe to the service, then you will continue using your existing garden waste bin for collections. We do not supply garden waste bins in smaller sizes.

Is the charge the same irrespective of when I join the service?

You can cancel the service at any time, but you will not be refunded or part-refunded.

Can I put my garden waste in my grey bin?

If I move to a new house, do I take my bin with me?

No - The bin needs to remain at your old property. You can however transfer the service to a new address if you are moving within the Stoke-on-Trent area. Please contact WasteManagement@stoke.gov.uk and we will re-allocate your subscription to your new address at a cost of £10.

What do I do with my bin and sticker if I am moving out of Stoke-on-Trent?

As there are no refunds for this service under these circumstances, you can leave your bin and sticker for the people moving into the property to use until the end of the service period.

If I do not subscribe to the service what do I do with my bin?

The bin needs to remain at your property. If you move home it will be available for the new occupier if they wish to subscribe to the service.

I have an assisted collection - will this continue if I sign up to the chargeable service?

Yes, your assisted collection for your garden waste bin will continue if you sign up to the service.

Can I burn my garden waste ?

It is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended) to dispose of domestic waste in a way that can cause pollution to the environment or harm to human health, such as by burning it. This means you must not burn certain types of waste that can create excessive smoke and fumes.

Are any properties exempt from the charge?

No - There are no exemptions. All those who wish to access the service will need to subscribe.

Is it legal to charge for the collection of garden waste?

Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and the Controlled Waste Regulations (England and Wales) 2012, councils can charge for the collection of garden waste.

Is the service available to everyone?

If you currently have a garden waste bin collected you are eligible to sign up to the garden waste subscription service.

What schedule frequency will the garden waste bin be collected on?

The service will be a fortnightly service running for 50 out of 52 weeks of the year (25 collections). Collections may be suspended in cases of severe extreme weather.

When will my bin be emptied?

Garden waste bins are emptied fortnightly on the same weekday as your recycling bin. Check here to find your collection day: Bin Day Calendar View | Stoke-on-Trent. Collections will only be suspended in cases of bad weather (and any of the circumstances detailed within the terms and conditions) and in such circumstances, we will collect the bin when it is safe to do so. No refunds will be made for suspensions of the service due to bad weather conditions (see terms and conditions).

Will side waste be taken by the binmen if presented next to the brown bin on collection day?

Garden side waste is not permitted and will not be collected alongside the brown bin. Organic waste is not allowed in grey bins or side waste presented with grey bins and will be classed as contamination.

Why is organic waste classed as contamination in grey bins?

Organic waste affects the performance of the Energy from Waste Plant (the incinerator) if presented in large quantities. We aim to recycle organic waste, not incinerate it.

I don't need to put my bin out every fortnight; will I get a discount/reduction?

No, the charge is fixed for the calendar year.

What can I put in my garden bin?

Small branches, hedge cuttings, garden plant waste, grass cuttings, fruit and veg waste are accepted by the garden waste service. See more information here - What can I do with my rubbish? | Stoke-on-Trent

Can I line my bin or put my waste in bags/sacks?

No. Garden waste must be loose in the bin.

What happens if you miss my bin?

If your bin was out on time and there were no issues reported by the crew then please contact us by the end of the next working day. This will then be recorded as a missed collection and a crew should return within two working days. This is in line with our existing service policies.

What happens if the collections are suspended because of snow or other operational issues?

In such circumstances we will do our best to return as soon as possible. If we cannot return to empty your bin, or the collection is delayed, we will not offer any refunds. More details are provided in our terms and conditions.

What happens if I put the wrong things in my garden waste bin and it is not emptied?

If the crew report that the bin has the wrong items in it and is therefore contaminated, the bin will not be emptied. Please remove any contamination and your bin will be collected on the next scheduled collection day.

What happens if I forget to put my bin out/I put my bin out late?

If the crew report that the bin was not out when they came, the team will not be able to return until the next scheduled collection day. Please ensure your bin is presented at the edge of your property by 06:00 am on the morning of collection with the handle facing the road.

Multinationals and some of Australia's biggest businesses could be forced to beef up financial reporting to authorities if new a corporate minimum tax rate is passed by parliament before July 1.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has released draft legislation for the new tax floor, a key element of a rewrite of international rules being led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Dr Chalmers and Labor's Andrew Leigh have called the change part of a global effort to prevent a race to the bottom on corporate income tax.

While the change won't come into force until January 1 next year, KPMG tax policy partner Alia Lum said if the legislation is passed by parliament before the end of the current financial year, some 2024 annual reports might be subject to new rules and require additional information.

""This may trigger new accounting standard requirements to disclose the expected impact of the global minimum tax in their June 30, 2024 annual reports, even though the rules won't apply for those groups until the following financial year,"" she said.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,Tom McIlroy,0.01960784313725483,448955075,21,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_4%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/cfdc12aaf6ec101a70968fbd0395b6b7ac04d880,eng-9421209

Some­times, it is not a mat­ter of equal­i­ty but eq­ui­ty be­cause a gov­ern­ment should spend more of its so­cial de­vel­op­ment dol­lars to sup­port low­er-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble groups.

How­ev­er, in the ex­er­cise of pub­lic func­tions, all cit­i­zens have the right to equal­i­ty of treat­ment.

If that right had been ob­served in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of prop­er­ty tax, there wouldn't have been any dis­par­i­ties. The de­ci­sion-mak­ing process and plan­ning were not based on a gov­er­nance mod­el for cit­i­zen-cen­tred­ness; that would have re­sult­ed in a sys­tem­at­ic and com­pre­hen­sive ap­proach to the roll­out.

The Min­is­ter of Fi­nance made a state­ment that re­ferred to prop­er­ties at the low­er lev­el that have ""not yet been val­ued, and these pro­por­tions may change.""

Is it right to send as­sess­ments of the ac­tu­al tax payable to prop­er­ty own­ers with­in 30 days when the Val­u­a­tion Di­vi­sion has yet to as­sess many prop­er­ties or send no­tices of the an­nu­al rental val­ues of the prop­er­ties to all own­ers?

That hap­pened be­fore the de­crease of the tax from three to two per cent, as some peo­ple have al­ready paid.

If the In­land Rev­enue can­not send as­sess­ments of tax payable by all cit­i­zens by March 31 (amend­ed to June 30 for this year), that will be a de­nial of some cit­i­zens' right to the pro­duc­tive use of their mon­ey, while oth­ers have use of theirs un­til when­ev­er they are as­sessed and no­ti­fied of the tax payable.

Un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, there is a right of the in­di­vid­ual to equal­i­ty of treat­ment by pub­lic au­thor­i­ties in the ex­er­cise of their func­tions.

Are all cit­i­zens be­ing treat­ed just­ly?

The au­thor­i­ties have a mam­moth task, but they had about ten years to per­fect the sys­tem. Notwith­stand­ing sec­tion 18 (2) of the Prop­er­ty Tax Act, In­land Rev­enue should take care not to breach Sec­tion 4 of the Con­sti­tu­tion.

The process of ob­jec­tions re­mains cum­ber­some and chal­leng­ing for prop­er­ty own­ers, as they still don't know, or some don't un­der­stand, the method used to as­sess the an­nu­al rental val­ues.

On what ob­jec­tive ba­sis could they ob­ject oth­er than pay for a val­u­a­tion, which is like­ly to cost more than $3,000, de­pend­ing on the val­ue of the prop­er­ty?

Don't ex­pect a prompt so­lu­tion, as the Com­mis­sion­er of Val­u­a­tions doesn't have to re­spond to an ob­jec­tion in un­der a year.

If the Gov­ern­ment were as pas­sion­ate about ad­dress­ing the ac­tu­al is­sues as they are de­fend­ing crit­i­cisms, in­clud­ing the dere­lic­tion of du­ty of mu­nic­i­pal cor­po­ra­tions who flout the Ex­che­quer Act with im­puni­ty, it would show its cit­i­zen-cen­tred­ness and that it cares about mis­man­age­ment of tax­pay­ers' mon­ey.

All we hear is that cit­i­zens are ob­ject­ing to the prop­er­ty tax, but they are not. The Op­po­si­tion is, al­though it was the UNC gov­ern­ment that an­nounced the in­ten­tion to im­ple­ment prop­er­ty tax in 2014.

Show­ing ar­ro­gance and the im­pres­sion that cit­i­zens' crit­i­cism is an­ti-gov­ern­ment and above re­proach sends a mes­sage that cit­i­zens are both­er­some pests be­cause they com­plain about a lack of ac­count­abil­i­ty and trans­paren­cy.

Such pos­tures have done noth­ing to con­vey Gov­ern­ment's good in­ten­tions or what­ev­er good they have done.

Cit­i­zens aren't con­vinced that more mon­ey to cor­po­ra­tions will make a dif­fer­ence be­cause of cor­rup­tion.

Not my words -- read Hansard's re­ports on Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tions.

The Gov­ern­ment ar­gues that cit­i­zens own­ing prop­er­ty abroad pay prop­er­ty tax.

But the schools there are fit for chil­dren. Cit­i­zens don't wake up to find that a neigh­bour's garage be­came a re­pair shop, or that the bar around the cor­ner and near a school be­came a mi­ni one-arm ban­dit casi­no.

They will not find ug­ly bill­boards block­ing their views of moun­tains and seas. They will not have to clean pub­lic drains them­selves for their well-be­ing.

All these things hap­pen here dai­ly and are pre­ventable if Gov­ern­ment holds ac­count­able the agen­cies over which they have law­ful ad­min­is­tra­tive di­rec­tion and con­trol.

Re­duc­ing the tax by one per cent and ex­tend­ing the pe­ri­od for ob­ject­ing to a val­u­a­tion are wel­come.

This col­umn has cit­ed the waste of mil­lions of tax­pay­ers' dol­lars giv­en to mu­nic­i­pal cor­po­ra­tions.

Ei­ther they failed to ac­count for these monies, sub­mit­ting no an­nu­al fi­nan­cial re­ports for years, or the Au­di­tor Gen­er­al had to qual­i­fy many re­ports be­cause proof of pay­ment and re­ceipts were un­avail­able.

But they are not the on­ly ones cul­pa­ble. So, too, is the min­istry re­spon­si­ble for lo­cal gov­ern­ment and Cab­i­net, each mem­ber be­ing ac­count­able un­der the doc­trine of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­i­ty.

If a cor­po­ra­tion or a state en­ter­prise fails to sub­mit ac­counts by the statu­to­ry date, the re­spon­si­ble min­istry should act against the CEO and oth­er mem­bers of the cor­po­ra­tion.

The min­istry can send warn­ing let­ters and give pub­lic up­dates in Par­lia­ment or rec­om­mend they be fired for break­ing the law.

That won't hap­pen be­cause Gov­ern­ment and the Op­po­si­tion will not act against their er­rant cor­po­ra­tions' lead­ers.

A cou­ple of weeks ago, the chair­man of Cou­va/Tabaquite/Tal­paro Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tion, Ryan Ram­per­sad, lament­ed the loss of in­come due to the de­crease of the prop­er­ty tax rate from three to two per cent.

How­ev­er, his par­ty wants the tax axed. The last fi­nan­cial re­port for that cor­po­ra­tion was for the fis­cal year 2008 and was laid in Par­lia­ment in 2022.

As ex­pect­ed, the au­di­tor couldn't rec­on­cile the ac­counts. We don't know how that cor­po­ra­tion spent our mon­ey for the past 15 years.

That is not a triv­ial mat­ter.

It is pro­fes­sion­al­ly un­eth­i­cal, mean­ing abuse of stan­dards and the Ex­che­quer law that gov­erns ac­count­abil­i­ty for the pub­lic purse.

Many peo­ple re­spon­si­ble for such neg­li­gence are the same ones ex­pect­ed to re­form lo­cal gov­ern­ment.

What ex­as­per­ates cit­i­zens is how politi­cians try to ma­nip­u­late fail­ure.

MP Mar­vin Gon­za­les, in his pre­sen­ta­tion last week on prop­er­ty tax, ad­mit­ted that Gov­ern­ment did noth­ing to col­lect an es­ti­mat­ed $14 bil­lion in tax­es since 2010.

As cum­ber­some and ar­cha­ic as the old regime was, it was fool­ish to for­go that amount of in­come rather than wait un­til com­plete readi­ness to im­ple­ment the new sys­tem.

You don't break down your house un­less you have an­oth­er shel­ter.

Then MP Faris Al-Rawi used the mur­der of peo­ple at Harpe Place to jus­ti­fy fic­tion when he ar­gued that the rev­enue earned from the prop­er­ty tax could pro­vide se­cu­ri­ty for hous­ing de­vel­op­ment projects in com­mu­ni­ties like Harpe Place.

If Gov­ern­ment hadn't stopped the old prop­er­ty tax, re­sult­ing in the loss of bil­lions in in­come, and if the In­land Rev­enue had col­lect­ed the bil­lions in ar­rears, there is no guar­an­tee that Harpe place would have had se­cu­ri­ty and the mur­ders would not have hap­pened -- mur­ders re­sult­ing from gang war­fare, by gangs that may have ben­e­fit­ed from tax­pay­ers' dol­lars.

Just two years ago, in 2021, speak­ing on the PT Bill, Sen­a­tor Allyson West said that the coun­try was ""at the bot­tom"" of the list in ef­fec­tive tax col­lec­tion among sev­er­al Cari­com coun­tries, in­clud­ing Guyana. $11 bil­lion was ""re­port­ed due but un­col­lect­ed.""

He addressed the full-day National Tax Conference, organised by the All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (AIFTP), South Zone, with support from the Telangana Tax Practitioners Association and the Federation of Telangana Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FTCCI), at FTCCI in Red Hills. Justice Ujjal Bhuyanwas the chief guest, and Justice Alok Aradhe, Chief Justice, High Court of Telangana, was the guest of honour. They opened the Conference by lighting the lamp along with the office bearers of the AIFTP.

Giving his keynote address, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan shared his personal experiences as a Judge of the Mumbai High Court and the landmark judgments on arrest provisions of GST under section 69 and property attachment provisions under section 83 of GST Law. He narrated to the hall full of over 400 advocates, tax practitioners, and tax consultants his experiences as a Judge in Mumbai High Court on the arrest. He stated while no court in the country was giving bail to the arrested, they have granted bail based on the principle that the officers who have the power to arrest a person shall also record the reason before arresting the person. His judgment in the Mumbai High Court paved the way for similar judgments in granting bail on property attachment. He stated that it will infringe the right to privacy of the person and it shall be exercised by the officer concerned very judiciously. He recalled the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) compared with sections 69 and 83 of the GST law and stated that these stringent provisions of law given to officers will have a profound impact on the business. He also stated that the power shall be exercised in such a way that the business is not crippled.

Justice Alok Aradhesaid that tax is the critical pillar of a civil society. The government imposes taxes to run the machinery of the state. It fulfils the social and economic growth of society. Tax is a vast subject. It is a complex and rapidly changing one. Quoting Chanakya, an ancient Indian polymath, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor, he said taxes from the citizens must be collected in such a way as honeybees collect nectar from the flowers, gently and without inflicting pain. He wished the conference would effectively exchange ideas and harness collective wisdom for the advancement of public good through reasonable and respectable practice.

Andres Iniesta has reportedly paid back extra tax owed in Japan over failure to declare part of his income, but claimed that he had also declared the earnings in Spain.

Spanish World Cup winner Iniesta, who spent five years with Japan's Vissel Kobe until 2023, was found to have failed to declare approximately 860 million yen ($5.7 million) in income for 2018, according to public broadcaster NHK and other media.

Foreign players in Japan are classified as either residents or non-residents for tax purposes.

If their contract is for less than one year and they are not accompanied by family members, they are classified as non-residents and pay less tax than residents, the reports said, citing the National Tax Agency.

The Osaka regional tax bureau judged that during 2018 Iniesta was a resident as he lived with his family members on a multi-year contract.

""In fiscal 2018, I reported my income from all of the world to taxation authorities in Spain,"" Iniesta said in a statement issued through his management company, cited by NHK and other media.

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said.

Iniesta has paid back the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

This is yet another move by the AMC to address the challenges of growing Solid Waste Management (SWM) in the City. The project has been awarded to Surat-based Steamhouse India Limited. The plant to be established on a 5-acre land at the Pirana Waste dumping site, is aimed at significantly reducing environmental pollution by curbing reliance on fossil fuels, thus aligning with global trends towards waste-to-steam projects. The total cost of the project as per tender is Rs 70 crore.

Ahmedabad, being the 7th Largest Metropolis in India with a population exceeding 63 lakhs, generates approximately 4000 Metric Tons of solid waste daily. The shift towards sustainable waste management is imperative as the decomposition of organic waste in landfills emits harmful greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change, and toxic substances from various waste types pose health risks to communities.

Dr Vijay Mistry, Jt Director Mechanical at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, told Zee News English that the total cost of the project is Rs 70 crores and the AMC will pay Rs 35 crore while Steam House India will pay rest Rs 35 crore. The deadline to make the project operational is by December 2024. ""Steam House will give Rs 17.75 lakhs as royalty per month to the AMC. They will be able to recover their entire cost in 8-10 years,"" Mistry said.

The AMC Jt Director further said that the decision to steer 300 Tons Per Day (TPD) of municipal solid waste to a steam plant under the PPP model is the AMC's another step towards sustainable practices and innovative solutions in waste management. Employing Waste to Steam (WTS) technology, the project aims to adhere to stringent emission norms while promoting a circular economy through the utilization of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF). The German-proven technology, being employed for the first time in India, promises several advantages, including reduced environmental impact, minimal operational costs, and efficient resource utilization.

""Till date, we have seen that only waste to electricity was considered the waste to energy model in India. But with this project, we have got an opportunity to showcase the benefits of waste to steam and that how capex can be almost halved helping the nation save money by not buying electricity at a premium price of Rs 7.5 per unit against Rs 2.5 per unit of solar and wind, while also reducing import of coal, forex outflow and air pollution,"" said Vishal S.

Here's How You Can Still File Your Income Tax Return! Personal Finance oi-Shravani Sinha By Shravani Sinha | Published: Sunday, March 24, 2024, 10:28 [IST]

As the deadline for filing income tax returns approaches, taxpayers who missed linking their PAN (Permanent Account Number) with Aadhaar by the June 2023 deadline are inquiring about the implications of an inactive PAN. However, fret not, as the income tax department has clarified that an inoperative PAN remains active, ensuring individuals can still file their income tax returns without facing major setbacks.

But what exactly does it mean to have an inoperative PAN? Simply put, when your PAN is not linked with your Aadhaar number, it falls into the category of being inactive. Despite this status, taxpayers can proceed with filing their income tax returns without hindrance.

The process of filing income tax returns remains unchanged even if your PAN is inactive. Taxpayers are required to pay their income taxes due and submit their Income Tax Returns (ITR) as usual. However, it's crucial to note that having an inactive PAN can lead to certain repercussions.

One significant consequence of an inactive PAN is the inability to claim a refund or interest on any refunds. This underscores the importance of linking Aadhaar and PAN, as it is mandatory for refund claims. Therefore, individuals with an inoperative PAN must ensure they complete the PAN-Aadhaar linking process at the earliest to avoid missing out on potential refunds.

For those who missed the initial income tax return deadline, there's still a window of opportunity. Taxpayers have until March 31, 2024, to file updated returns for the assessment years 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24. However, it's essential to remember that any additional tax liabilities must be settled along with the updated return.

With the deadline for individuals not requiring an audit for the Financial Year 2023-24 (Assessment Year 2024-25) fast approaching on July 31, 2024, taxpayers must ensure they comply with all necessary requirements for filing their income tax returns.

While an inactive PAN may present certain challenges, such as the inability to claim refunds, it does not impede the filing process itself. Taxpayers should prioritize linking their PAN with Aadhaar to avoid any potential complications and ensure a smooth income tax filing experience. Additionally, those who missed earlier deadlines should take advantage of the opportunity to file updated returns before the March 31 deadline.

Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy recently gifted 15 lakh shares to grandson Ekagrah Rohan Murty valued at around Rs 240 crore, according to a regulatory filing.

Murthy has gifted 15 lakh shares, or 0.04 per cent of his equity holding, to Rohan Narayana Murty son Master Ekagrah Rohan Murty -making him the youngest billionaire shareholder of Infosys.

The value of total gifted shares come to around Rs 240 crore as per company's closing share price of Rs 1,602.3 apiece.

Ekagrah is the third grandchild of Narayana Murthy.

His first two grandchildren are daughters of Akshata Murty and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Although the specifics of this share transfer remain undisclosed, similar to other forms of income, gifts can be taxable under specific conditions. However, exemptions from tax may apply to certain gift scenarios.

Similarly, in January 2024 Wipro founder Azim Premji transferred 1.02 crore equity shares of Wipro held by him to his two sons -Rishad Premji and Tariq Premji- as a gift.

What Rules Say On Gifting?

Under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act, this is the current taxation method for gifts in the recipient's possession;

According to a report by Moneycontrol, cash gifts, immovable properties, and specified movable properties received without or with insufficient consideration from non-relatives are categorised as gifts.

The value of these gifts is accounted for as 'income from other sources' and taxed according to your relevant income tax bracket. In the case of a gift to a minor, the parent or legal guardian assumes responsibility for the tax obligation.

Money: Taxation is triggered only when you receive money gifts (in cash, via cheque, etc.) totaling more than Rs 50,000 in a year. Below this threshold, no tax is applicable.

Therefore, if you receive money gifts amounting to Rs 75,000 within a year, the entire sum -- not just the excess over Rs 50,000 (Rs 25,000) -- will be subject to taxation.

Movable property: If you receive certain specified movable properties without consideration (i.e., without making any reciprocal payment) during a year, and their total fair market value surpasses Rs 50,000, the entire amount becomes taxable. For instance, if you acquire jewellery and paintings valued at Rs 20 lakh within a year, the entire sum will be subject to tax since it exceeds the Rs 50,000 threshold.

In cases where you receive specified movable properties for inadequate consideration (i.e. when you make some reciprocal payment), taxation applies to the difference between the aggregate fair market value and the consideration paid, provided this differential amount exceeds Rs 50,000. For example, if you receive jewellery and paintings worth Rs 20 lakh in total during a year and pay Rs 12 lakh for them, Rs 8 lakh will be taxable.

It's important to note that taxation is applicable solely to specified movable properties, including shares/securities, jewellery, archaeological collections, drawings, paintings, sculptures, any work of art, bullion, and virtual digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies).

Immovable property: When you acquire any immovable property (land and/or building) without consideration (no reciprocal payment made), and its stamp duty value (property value assessed by the government) exceeds Rs 50,000, the entire stamp duty value becomes taxable. For instance, if you receive a property with a stamp duty value of Rs 10 lakh as a gift, the entire amount will be subject to tax.

In cases where you acquire immovable property for inadequate consideration (some reciprocal payment made), taxation applies to the difference between the stamp duty value and the consideration paid, provided this difference exceeds Rs 50,000. For example, if you receive a property with a stamp duty value of Rs 25 lakh and make a payment of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 15 lakh will be taxed as a gift.

It's worth noting that for money gifts and movable properties, the Rs 50,000 annual limit (for each) applies to the total value of gifts received during the year. However, for immovable property, the Rs 50,000 limit applies to each property transaction. Therefore, if you receive multiple properties as gifts in a year, and none of them surpasses the Rs 50,000 limit, no tax is applicable.

When gifts remain untaxed:

The Moneycontrol report added that in the scenarios outlined above, taxation is only applicable when gifts are received from non-relatives and surpass the Rs 50,000 limit (individually applicable for money gifts, movable properties, and immovable property).

According to the Income Tax Act, gifts received from relatives are exempt from taxation, regardless of their monetary value. But who qualifies as a 'relative'?

Let's consider a hypothetical couple, H and W. H's relatives include a) H's spouse, b) H's siblings, c) W's siblings, d) H's parents' siblings, e) any direct ancestors or descendants of H or W, as well as the spouses of b), c), d), and e).

Direct ancestors encompass blood relatives such as parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, while direct descendants include children, grandchildren, and so forth.

Gifts received in the context of marriage, through a will, or via inheritance are also exempt from taxation. It's important to highlight that marriage is the sole occasion on which received gifts remain untaxed. Gifts obtained on any other occasion are liable to taxation.

Additionally, the exemption extends to instances where funds are received from specific sources such as funds, foundations, educational and medical institutions (as outlined in section 10(23C)), or from charitable trusts and institutions (as specified under sections 12A, 12AA, and 12AB).",news18.com,news,News18,,0.3254901960784313,448952051,1,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/01/untitled-design-5-2024-01-c083d9aa5fa17658d8ad8b4a1a53951a-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675,eng-9420272

In this interview, Adebayo says President Bola Tinubu needs to own up to the failure of his policies even as he admonishes the electorate to look well before they leap in future elections. Excerpts:

You said you could do better than what the President Tinubu administration is doing. What is your view of the present of state of affairs.

I am not surprised at the state of things, but I am disappointed. I am not surprised because we predicted that this would be the outcome. It doesn't matter whom you put out there. This will be the outcome if you adopt these policies. We were asking Nigerians to pay attention as we were debating these issues.

There were three policies that we needed to deal with. What do we do with the issue of the cost of governance. 2. What do we do with the issue of subsidy? Not only petroleum but subsidy in many other sectors. 3. What do we do with the issue of foreign exchange? On these three issues, I have fundamental disagreement with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governor Peter Obi, and many other people who were on that side that these policies will not work. It has never worked in any country before, in Nigeria, in the past, including when we did SAP, it didn't work for us. It is not about one person who is good, another is bad. If you drag me to the Villa or Eagle Square and force me to announce these policies, you will get the same result. Anyone who adopts these same policies will get the same result. Economists will ask you if there are countries who adopted these policies; are there countries within our hemisphere, countries within our state of development, countries that have our primary production sector like we have who announced these policies and it has worked? I don't think so.

I am surprised that some personalities were talking about the Argentina model, I am very familiar with the Argentina model. If you ask an average Argentine to choose between President Javier Milei and President Bola Tinubu, they will tell you to bring Tinubu and give you Milei.

You are saying Atiku is wrong on the Argentina model recommended to Tinubu?

I can say Vice President Atiku Abubakar may be well intentioned but is misinformed. It is an error. If you look at the situation in Argentina, we may get to that position, I hope we are not, but we are travelling in that direction and they are ahead of us in terms of misery. They have one month of 512% of inflation. I don't know if economists can understand the temperature of 512%. They have lost virtually all their wealth. The person there now is from the Austrian school of thought. Argentines are complaining every day as they have had the worst economic performance since 1980. I am not saying we should not criticise a non-performing government of President Tinubu of APC, but you do not say somebody complaining of too much sun should be put in the oven, that's not the way to solve the problem. These policies are not working. Unfortunately, Nigerians have voted these policies. We voted for these policies either because we didn't pay attention or we didn't understand the implications of these policies. When you decide to say you vote for a government that says it will remove subsidy from day one, which was what President Tinubu said, which was what Vice President Atiku Abubakar said, which was what Governor Peter Obi said, and we said don't listen to them, but people thought they have experienced and maybe they are more realistic than us. So, they voted that way. So, any of them that formed the government and adopted any of these policies will have, at the minimum, what we are experiencing now or even worse. These policies are not good, not because of the parties announcing them but because structurally they are not suitable to us. Of course, they come with some benefits, and you can see the benefits. More income to the government, for example, because they are not subsidising anymore. More income from the foreign exchange differential because they are not defending the naira in the old way anymore. You also have the benefits of goods becoming cheaper, that's why people are saying they are exporting goods from Nigeria to Niger and neighbouring countries because with lower currency, our goods and any other thing we produce become cheaper, those are the advertised benefits, but we are not structurally prepared for them.

You said the policies are bad. But some informed people said the country was already in bad shape, and some of the present policies are what is needed before we can recover.

I don't agree with any of your postulations. This is the reason why. There are arguments, but not every argument addresses the core issue. Every decision you make in economics, at least you will have two choices, sometimes like 10 choices. In our case, we have about 55,000 choices. We decide to make a world that does not require better governance that does not require people in the higher echelon losing income because you purnish the person with the least contribution to political campaign. We are subsidising so many things in this country, the only one the people have some kind of participation because it is the only product we commonly use and this is where the subsidy removal started from. Secondly, there was no attempt to do auditing. You will recall that I was shouting during the election that 80% of our crude was being stolen, and I campaigned on months on that, unfortunately voters didn't realise that whoever was able to tackle the crude oil theft should be the one to lead the country. Our problems are not difficult to solve. The problems are not insurmountable. It is just that the method to solving them will not be the continuation of what they were doing before.

Do you think we have the right economic team surrounding President Tinubu?

He has the right kind of team for what he wants to do. But what he wants to do isn't correct. If I say we should repair a leaking house, and my senior brother says no, let us sell the house, if he has the mandate, he will bring auctioneers, valuers and estate agents to sell it when I would have brought plumbers, carpenters for repairs. I can not now say he doesn't have the right team. He wants to sell the house. So, he has the right team to sell the house, but if I want to fix the house, I will bring a different team to fix the house.

If you were President Tinubu today, what would you be doing differently to stol the bleeding?

If I became president on the day he became president, I would not announce any of these policies. In fact, I will immediately go to the National Assembly to amend the Appropriation Act and the Petroleum Industry Act to remove these statutory mandates to yank off the subsidy.

But if I am becoming president today, the first thing to do is to convince the people of Nigeria and the government that these policies are not right. If you say I should advise a president who believes that the benefits of these policies are down the line, he is not going to listen to me because he is committed to the benefits of the policies are down the line. So, the first thing to do is to convince him that the benefits never came to England. England industrialised itself. These benefits didn't come to Brazil until (president) Lula came and changed them towards social investments. I don't know where they are getting the policies from. I suspect its from the IMF or the bankers who are contributing to their campaign, insisting on these policies, but if they are ideologically committed to these policies, then the solution they can find will be solution by palliative which is to suspend the full effect of it overtime. But what they will soon discover by that is such that the social misery will be so much, inflation and hyper-inflation will be so much that the money they saved may not be up to the money they spend on palliative.

So, they need a change of direction even though I cannot guarantee that a well experienced accountant, who is a cost cutter like Tinubu and who has Wale Edun around him and has chosen Cardoso as his preferred Central Bank Governor, I don't think they are willing to change for now. I think they should just be a little more efficient in the macro-economy policies they have taken, and there are five measures they should have if they must take it. One of such is that they must have a way to increase their revenue, because right now, they are just collecting less than 20% of the collectibles.

There are so many sacred cows they don't want to collect money from. Secondly, they need to bring efficiency to their accounts. Running a free market economy as they are going towards, they need more feedback, more sensitivity, and quicker reaction time, which means they need to put sharper and smarter people in their governance. Thirdly, they need to restructure the government spending in such a way that they separate the fiscal spending which they are controlling and let the CBN Governor run his monetary policy and be banker to the country not the banker to the government alone. Fourthly, they need to find ways to generate employment.

They don't want to spend money on social programmes as stated in Chapter Two of the Constitution, which means they will be going to Qatar and other places because the sovereign investment money they need to spend to generate employment, they don't want to spend it because they are following IMF. Now they will be begging foreign investors to come and put money in our country, money we have even within our country but they will be going out but if they are not efficient in that regard, then they can succeed. Lastly, they need to do something about inflation. If they don't control inflation by controlling their spending, increasing their revenue, they can't get Nigerians to be productive.

What would you politically douse the tension in the land if you were Tinubu?

He needs to be like Head of State, like father of the nation. He needs to be less arrogant in the assessment of how righteous their polices are. They need to engage people more. However, people need to understand at the same time that you voted for these policies. It is like people of Israel asking Moses to lead them out of Egypt and, on getting to the wilderness, they realised it was not an easy place to be and they started complaining. That is a normal thing. The people of Nigeria voted for these policies even though they were not good policies. The government should use humility to reach out to the people and at the same time show social justice to the people by making sure that the burden of this hardship is not borne only by the less privileged.

Do you think the president has what it takes to fix this country?

I have the feeling that if we have a leader who is determined to fix Nigeria and who wants to listen to Nigerians and carry everybody along and look for the best talent and not just political party alone, we will do well. I would have preferred Nigerians voted for me, which was why I didn't support Tinubu. I think I would have done better than him. But anybody who is put there and who is determined to use all the resources in Nigeria can succeed. Of course, the president is a Nigerian, a well-educated person, quite intelligent but has wrong policies. He needs to open his mind and get ideas from other people, and add to his. But there is no escaping the consequences of the policies people voted for.

did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up- Thomas Edison (1847-1931) American inventor and businessman.

Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors of all time, was said to have filed an estimated 500-600 unsuccessful or abandoned applications in his lifetime. According to the record, he failed 2774 times. But that didn't stop him from succeeding with the invention of the light bulb in January 1879 after more than 1000 failed trials. Now, imagine if the American inventor had given up because of the hundreds of botched attempts. Or because of the derision he received from the public. Or because of not wanting to incur more debts after huge capital investments, sometimes sourced from interests-laden loans. If he stopped his quest for the bulb, it would have been a tragic setback for mankind. Somehow, someone else would probably have done it. But, in another age. This would delay its immense benefit to man. But Thomas Edison wouldn't allow these distractions; and today he stands as a towering lesson in unwavering perseverance in human endeavours.

I solemnly recommend Thomas Edison to Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu. Although the inventor wasn't a government leader, his story teaches those holding political office that you don't give up your strategies for the sake of expediency. Handling the ship of state, as I once said in an earlier piece, is not a sprint, not a short race. It's not a run for the moment; it is a marathon, a long distance, where strategy is prioritized, not sacrificed on the altar of short-lived concerns. Of course you don't abandon today altogether. But your two legs are moving in such a way that they are more positioned to hasten into tomorrow, solving today's challenges to disallow them from escaping into tomorrow.

What Tinubu has done, fuel subsidy removal and leaving our naira to compete with others, is the grueling furnace the nation needs to birth into abiding growth and development. Pls, note the 'birth' I deliberately applied. There's no birth that comes without pangs.

I recall as I write that there were attempts at bringing about these changes in the recent and remote pasts. Under Presidents Yar'Adua, Jonathan, and Buhari, there were deafening uproar against moves to do away with the fuel subsidy. True, there were inflationary trends that accompanied the regulated subsidy removal. Cost of living went up; costs of goods and services flew beyond the reach of the masses. It also took its toll on government as it could not honour its promises to deliver some basic infrastructure. Labour and the political opposition as well as civil society ganged up to lampoon the authorities for ""imposing hardship"" on the people. Unfortunately, the leaders of the day couldn't stand this backlash. They did not have the backbone to see through their initiatives. So they pulled back, instead of persevering with their nationalistic economic policies. Each time we retraced the bold steps towards the path taking us to the zone of emancipation, we were actually doing two things simultaneously: moving backwards to a despised past and throwing our problems into tomorrow for our children to solve. Which good parent would do that? What serious leader wishing to bequeath a rich heritage would not resolve the critical issues that rear their heads under him, but would leave them for his successors.

In the early 1960s when US President J.F. Kennedy was giving his country radical governance, he also came up with something completely out of the world: America must get to the moon before the end of the decade! Indeed, she did in 1969, despite scoffers' skepticism from the camp of the political opposition. Kennedy wasn't alive when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in July 1969. But the Kenn vision was alive and kicking. Why? Because realizing the vision wasn't left in the hands of a hazy indistinct future when the conditions would be right or when there would be no protests or jeering.

The conditions for change or reforms are always rife as the idea sets in. If you don't act on them to tame the problems they are meant to deal with, those problems will grow bigger as you postpone them for another day. That's the experience we have had over the years with the issues of fuel subsidy and the naira floating. We pampered them to become monsters.

Bola Tinubu must prevent them from becoming invincible Frankenstein's monsters that threaten to destroy their creators. The only way deal with them is to boldly push through with his reforms. This is not the time to beat a retreat like his predecessors did. Under him, this great African country can go beyond its potential status to emerge as the giant of the African continent. Let him prove that his leadership this era of our history can make a difference.

This is a duty President Bola Tinubu owes the 200m+ Nigerians he is governing. We must all support him, irrespective of political party, gender, religious or social class divide. The people want him to sustain his reforms till he gets the 'light bulb' for Nigeria the way Thomas Edison persevered to get the bulb for mankind.

He highlights key insurances and suggests considering ELSS for tax savings.Harshvardhan Roongta, CFP, Roongta Securities, says ""do not invest in any product to save tax. It is not about insurance or any other investment product. You have to look at the merit of that product. You should ask yourself a question any time that you are going to be looking at investing; would you invest in this product if there were no tax benefits available? If the answer is no, then do not invest in it only to save taxes.""

March 31 deadline is almost around the corner and a time when people look at a lot of tax saving instruments. It is usually an insurance policy in most of the cases and this is the time when we see a lot of mis-selling cases rising as far as insurance policies are concerned. A right way to look at insurance should be as an instrument against risk protection. But when it comes to saving taxes, you have a lot of options in insurance. How can one go about it?

Harshvardhan Roongta: Yes, we are at the fag-end of the financial year and at this point in time, all the individuals or rather most of them will be running around to save taxes because they have deadlines to finish with their investments to save tax. The most convenient person available would be a life insurance or agent around you and when you are in a hurry to save tax, most likely you will buy into something which is conveniently available rather than what is appropriate for you.

So, I would say do not invest in any product to save tax. It is not about insurance or any other investment product. You have to look at the merit of that product. You should ask yourself a question any time that you are going to be looking at investing; would you invest in this product if there were no tax benefits available? If the answer is no, then do not invest in it only to save taxes.

What you have to do is look at your requirements or your goals and your timelines, and then find a product which matches that goal and provides a tax benefit, so that is okay and that is good. But if you are investing only to save tax and it helps you no other way in your financial life, then you should definitely not look at it. At this point in time, as you rightly mentioned, towards the end of the financial year, you will have many cases of mis-selling, something that people will come and tell you and lure you for high returns probably and ask you to invest into something, well that is not how you should go about investing for your tax saving purposes.

How should one actually look at insurance as a product and also as a product that helps you save tax? Insurance product allowing you to save tax should be like a byproduct of this investment that you might want to look into or should that be the first priority?

Harshvardhan Roongta: First and foremost, insurance and investment should not be clubbed together. The purpose of insurance is to provide for security in case something happens. It is a pure risk cover. If you buy a life insurance policy, what is your primary objective saying that as an earning member of the family, if that person is not available because of unforeseen circumstances, then there is going to be a financial burden on the family because there was an earning member who is no more.

So, you want to replace yourself financially and that is your primary objective of buying an insurance policy. Now that can be fulfilled with a term insurance plan. You do not need to buy an investment oriented policy because if you buy an investment oriented policy, you will not be able to buy the adequate cover because the premiums will be higher.

If you want a lower premium with maximum cover, term plan is the only alternative. Now, term plan insurance premium also is eligible for deduction under Section 80C. So, if you buy a term insurance plan and you pay the premiums, you will get a deduction under Section 80C. The government has been trying to promote financial security and encourage individuals to buy such insurance policies for the welfare of the families and for themselves and to motivate in this direction, the government says that for the premiums paid, there will be a deduction in income tax. So, look at it only from that angle.

The other insurances that an individual would require in their own setup would be health insurance for sure. One needs to make sure that in case of any hospitalisation, you have adequate resources for proper treatment because the cost of medical treatment these days are skyrocketing. Probably a treatment that was costing about Rs 50,000 a few years ago would be approximately Rs 5 lakh or Rs 10 lakh today. That is how the cost of medical treatment is going up

You need to buy adequate mediclaim insurance. By adequate I mean, if you are in metros, you would definitely need Rs 10-15 lakh. If you are in non-metros, then probably a Rs 10 lakh sum insured should be good enough. But given the combinations that are available today in the form of a base policy and a super top up, a family of four can insure themselves at a very reasonable cost for a sum insured of up to Rs 50 lakh as well and the premiums that you pay not only for yourself, your spouse, your dependent children, even if the premiums that you pay for your parents are eligible for deduction under Section 80D.

As I said, club two things together, the tax saving would be a byproduct, not the main reason. So you need medical insurance. Now, if you are in the new tax regime, which is the default tax regime, there is no deduction for Section 80D but you would still go ahead and buy a cover for your family irrespective of whether or not you get tax benefits. If you get tax benefits, great, if not, it's fine. It does not mean that you will go and buy something else. So, that is the basic approach with which you have to look for products that you need in the last few days of the financial year.

Do not get carried away and commit yourself to a policy for 10-20 years only to save tax this year and then you pay on for the next 10-20 years. I do not think that is a smart thing to do.

Obviously, you need to java your life insurance and health insurance in place and these are the first and the basic steps when we talk about planning your financial portfolio. Given the kind of explanation you gave in order to have the right kind of insurance, how can one avail tax benefit as per 80C and 80D?

Harshvardhan Roongta: There are a few conditions that you will have to fulfil. First, look at what kind of insurance should an individual with a family consider? One is, all the earning members in the family should look at buying a family term insurance. It has to be earning members of the family, because there is a dependency on that income, even if you are a single earning member family or a double income family, you need to ensure that the earning members of the family have adequate insurance.

So, term plan is one thing that you will look at. The other insurance that earning members of the family need to look at is a critical illness policy. The premiums that you pay under that policy are eligible for deduction under Section 80D.

The third that you need to look at is a personal accident policy that is disability due to an accident. In case of any accident related disability, there is a monetary benefit that comes to the insured while he or she is alive. So, that is the third insurance that you need to look at. If you are buying a disability, a personal accident policy along with your term plan, then you get a deduction under 80C. If you are buying a standalone personal accident policy from a general insurance company, then there is no specific tax benefit available. Nevertheless, you need to still buy it in that case.

The fourth insurance that you need to look at is a mediclaim. This will ensure all family members, whether earning or not, whether they are children, young children, infants, old parents, will be insured. The premiums that you pay in those policies which are the base policy and super topper, all of those premiums are eligible for deduction under Section 80D.

Now, there is a limit to this. You can pay for yourself, your spouse and dependent children and the total limit under section 80D is Rs 25,000 per annum. If you are adding your parents, rather you are paying premiums for your parents and they are not senior citizens, that is they are below the age of 60, then you have another Rs 25,000 that you can pay. So, a total of Rs 50,000 deduction can be taken.

If your parents are senior citizens and you are paying for them, then the limit increases to Rs 50,000. So, these are the limits that are available under section 80D. Of course, if you are paying those premiums, you must take the benefit of tax deduction, provided you are also filing your returns under the old tax regime.

With regards to premiums under Section 80C, the term plan insurance that I am talking about or life insurance for that matter, there is a condition that the premium should be 10% of the sum insurance. So, basically, or the other way around saying that whatever premiums you are paying, the sum insured should be 10 times of that. If you are not qualifying into that criteria, then you cannot claim deduction under section 80C. So, just be mindful of these sub-conditions which are there to fulfil before you claim the tax benefit under respective sections and then you are good to go. And these are the insurances that you should look at.

All the policies that I spoke about are pure risk covered policies, pure protection, there is no investment element to these and nothing comes back to you if nothing happens to you. So, these are pure risk covers, which are ideal for a family and to protect themselves financially.

Let us also quickly talk about having a ULIP plan and the factors that you might want to consider before putting money in. What are the tax advantages on ULIP and the factors one might want to consider. It is under 80C. You might also want to just consider ELSS instead of ULIPs?

Harshvardhan Roongta: Coming back to the point where I said that insurance is meant only for protection purposes and that should not be clubbed with any investments. ULIP is a combination of protection and investments. So, from the tax element point of view, the premiums that you pay in a ULIP policy also qualify for deduction in the Section 80C. However, there is a limit in terms of the when you receive the maturity proceeds.

Earlier the concept was that even if it is a ULIP policy and you pay as much as you wish, if you are paying more than say Rs 2.5 lakh premium, says you are paying Rs 5 lakh as premium, the maturity proceeds from an insurance policy are tax exempt under Section 10(10D). So, even if it is a ULIP and you are getting the money back, it is going to be tax free, that provision has changed and been modified to say that if your annual aggregated premium is more than Rs 2.5 lakh in a year, then the maturity proceeds are not going to be tax free.

Earlier it was tax exempt, now it is not tax exempt and that is mind you an aggregate. So, it is not that only one per policy of Rs 2.5 lakh premium. If you have three policies and all three have Rs 1 lakh premium each, you are paying Rs 3 lakh per annum. So, on an aggregated basis you are paying more than Rs 2.5 lakh in a year, so the maturity proceeds that you get on all your ULIP policies will be taxable, it will not be tax free. So, that is one part.

Now coming to the second part, I would prefer to have investments separate in an exclusive pure investment product and insurance being separate. ELSS works very well in terms of saving tax under Section 80C. So, that is one element which people should very actively consider.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,news,Economic Times,,0.192156862745098,448951026,1,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108734169,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-27780,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",eng-9421662

She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third-largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with more than 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

""The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,"" she said.",voanews.com,news,VOA Voice of America,,0.223529411764706,448950477,1,https://gdb.voanews.com/4B363FAA-E204-4B09-A168-8E0E5A867CE6.jpg,eng-9414921

(AP) -- Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday vetoed Republican proposals that would have allowed election observers to get closer to poll workers and required a new post-election audit, while signing a bill increasing the penalty for assaulting an election official.

Evers, a Democrat, also signed into law a bill requiring that political TV ads using artificial intelligence come with a disclaimer and a bipartisan bill exempting purchases of precious metal, such as gold and silver, from the state sales tax. The exemption does not apply to jewelry and other personal property, including works of art and scrap metal. But it would exempt from the sales tax coins, bars, rounds or sheets containing at least 35% of gold, silver, copper, platinum, or palladium.

The AI bill also passed with bipartisan support. Backers said the disclaimer is needed for ads that use the rapidly evolving AI technology so viewers get help in determining the difference between fact and fiction.

Evers also signed a bill allowing for children to occasionally sell crafts and other non-food items in public places, such as a park, without having to get permits. Current law already allows children to operate lemonade stands on private property without fear of being shut down by the government for lack of permits. The new law expands where people under 18 can sell items in public spaces such as parks.

He signed a bipartisan bill that makes it a felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison for assaulting an election official. The measure, which comes in the wake of increasing threats against election workers, also prohibits the release of clerks' personal phone numbers or addresses.

Evers also signed a bill that prohibits municipalities from closing more than half of polling places within 30 days before an election. That comes after many polling places were closed in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Milwaukee, only five of the city's 182 polling sites were open in April 2020.

Evers vetoed four Republican election-related bills.

One would have required a post-election audit, which Evers said he vetoed because he objects to Republicans' ""ongoing efforts to interfere with and usurp control over election administration and undermine Wisconsin's election administration system."" Existing post-election audits already ensure that the state's elections are fair and run properly, Evers said.

Another vetoed bill would have allowed election observers to be within 3 feet of election workers. Current law bars them from being any closer than 3 feet from workers.

Republicans have pushed for years to give observers more power while watching people vote. But Evers, in his veto message, said allowing them to get closer would increase the risk of interference and voter intimidation.

The state election commission early Thursday evening announced plans to draft administrative rules governing observers' conduct. The commission did not say what the regulations would restrict. The rule-making process can take years in Wisconsin; any drafts could go through multiple changes during that time.

He vetoed two bills that would have tightened the rules for casting and collecting absentee ballots in nursing homes. Republicans introduced them after criticizing how voting was conducted in nursing homes during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Evers also vetoed a bill that would have required a special election or Senate approval of his appointments when there is a vacancy for the positions of secretary of state, treasurer, attorney general and secretary of the Department of Public Instruction. Republicans pushed the measure after Evers named Sarah Godlewski as secretary of state after the elected office holder, Doug La Follette, resigned.

Evers said he objected to the Legislature trying to infringe on his powers of appointment. He said if enacted, the proposal could lead to long vacancies in the positions.",hosted.ap.org,news,Associated Press,,0.1215686274509804,448950419,1,summary_large_image,eng-9415683

Bobrovsky finished with 34 saves.

The Rangers have won six of their last nine games against the Panthers and are 6-1-1 in their last eight home games against Florida. New York improved to 25-9-0 overall at home.

Tkachuk opened the scoring at 8:18 of the first, tipping Josh Mahura's shot past Shesterkin. Luostarinen made it 2-0 just 21 seconds into the second on a setup by Reinhart, who leads the Panthers with 80 points.

Panarin had a hat trick in Thursday's 5-2 win at Boston and has 99 points this season. The 32-year-old Russian forward is trying to become the first Ranger to reach 100 points since Jaromir Jagr in 2005-06 and the seventh to reach the milestone.

Rangers rookie forward Matt Rempe played his first home game since March 11, when he was tossed from a 3-1 win over New Jersey after a high elbow on Devils defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler. Rempe was suspended four games by the league for the hit.

Florida captain Aleksander Barkov missed the contest as did defensemen Aaron Ekblad, Gustav Forsling and Dmitry Kulikov.

Everyone with past dealings with ""Jacko"" was in disbelief. ""You're f---ing joking right?"" one former colleague texted. The police commissioner Karen Webb - a proven media klutz in her own right, who has burnt through comms staff - would be getting her PR messaging managed by a TV journalist known for doing anything to get a story. If Jacko was the answer, tell us, what exactly is the question?

That spilt out on to 2GB radio, with Ray Hadley (always handily well-briefed on what's happening with the coppers) kicking the appointment. By mid-week, there were crisis talks. NSW police minister Yasmin Catley was fingered for pushing the idea. Premier Chris Minns was trying to stay out of it. On Sunday, this column reached Jacko, who declined to comment on whether he was still taking the job.

Adding to the mix was a Samantha Maiden tabloid bomb, which revealed that a Spotlight producer had booked a Thai massage for Lehrmann in November 2022 on a Seven corporate card. Maiden had texts from Jacko to the employee, telling them to get the masseuses to reverse the charges, using Google Translate to ask them to take cash instead. Lehrmann denies using the masseuses.

It's worth pausing for a moment to consider this depraved behaviour. In an effort to lure an accused rapist to do a chequebook journalism deal to tell ""his side"" of the story, someone thought the best method was to attempt to give him access to Thai massages.

Toronto is considering something called a stormwater charge along with stormwater charge credits and a water service charge.

Together, they could revolutionize how the city manages its water infrastructure and addresses environmental concerns.

The essence of the proposal lies in the need to address Toronto's aging stormwater infrastructure and its impact on the environment.

As the city continues to grow and urbanize, its capacity to manage stormwater effectively becomes increasingly strained. This strain could not only lead to flooding and water pollution but also could pose risks to public health and safety.

At its core, the stormwater charge currently being floated by the City of Toronto aims to incentivize responsible water management practices while providing the necessary funding for infrastructure upgrades and environmental initiatives.

It's not the first time such a charge has been considered.

The proposed fee structure would likely be based on the amount of impermeable surface area on a property, such as roofs, driveways, and parking lots, which contribute to runoff during rainfall events.

By tying the charge to property characteristics, the hope is to encourage Toronto property owners to invest in green infrastructure solutions, such as rain gardens, permeable pavement, and green roofs, which can mitigate stormwater runoff and reduce the burden on the city's infrastructure.

Proponents of the stormwater charge will likely argue that it aligns with Toronto's goals of becoming a more sustainable and resilient city.

By investing in green infrastructure and stormwater management practices, Toronto can not only mitigate the impacts of urbanization on its water systems but also adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.

Furthermore, revenue generated from the stormwater charge could be earmarked for projects that enhance water quality, protect natural habitats, and promote biodiversity, benefiting both residents and the environment.

However, the proposal will likely face criticism from some quarters, particularly regarding its potential financial implications.

The stormwater charge could place an unfair burden on certain demographics, such as low-income households or small businesses, which may lack the resources to implement water management solutions or absorb additional costs.

There will likely also be concerns about the administrative complexities of implementing and enforcing the charge, as well as the potential for unintended consequences, such as property devaluation or reduced economic activity.

Regardless, the proposed stormwater charge represents an attempt to address the pressing issues of urban water management and environmental sustainability in Toronto.

Under the previous scheme, some residents belonged to protected categories and were entitled to a reduction of up to 100 percent. Residents of working age who did not belong to a protected category were required to pay a minimum of 20 percent of their overall bills.

However, this is soon to change, as protected categories have been scrapped under the new scheme and all residents of working age will have to pay a minimum of 25 percent of their council tax bill as of April 1, 2024. This will result in higher fees for thousands across the borough, with some reporting their shock upon receiving their latest bill.

On top of this, a 4.99 percent Council Tax increase will also be introduced, two percent of which is earmarked for social care services for older residents and local people with disabilities. In total, this means an additional £1.71 per week will be payable for an average Band D property.

Speaking back in December before the new CTRS was approved, Cabinet Member for Finance and Regeneration, Cllr Graham Turner, described the report as ""the worst"" he'd had to bring forward and said he was making the recommendations 'sadly and against all his principles'.

He continued: ""We last changed the scheme in April 2018. As you well know many things have happened since then that have had an impact on the finance of the council, so we have undertaken a review of the current scheme.

""Due to the current financial situation caused by the lack of a fair funding scheme for local government and the need to produce a balanced budget next March, we are proposing to reduce the scheme which will save us just under an estimated £4.5m.

""Across the board, we will still have the most generous scheme across West Yorkshire. I know that's not much solace for our residents but we are committed to helping as many people as we can during the current financial mess the current government has managed to create.

""If we didn't change the scheme, there would be another £4.5m in cuts to services.""

""The Japanese taxation authorities began an investigation with focus on my residence status under tax rules, and concluded that I was a resident (in Japan) during part of 2018,"" he said.

Iniesta has paid back the additional tax demanded, the statement said.

""Therefore, the income during the period is under double taxation,"" he said, adding that he has demanded excess tax payment be returned based on the two country's agreement on double taxation.

The former administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, in which Mohammed served as its information minister, had unsuccessfully pushed for the regulation of social media and opposed media freedoms.

The administration suspended X (then Twitter) for seven months (June 2021 to January 2022), accusing the microblogging site of supporting the October 2020 #EndSARS protests.

Speaking at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos at the weekend, Mohammed, who is also the Managing Partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, emphasised the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence.

He argued that his call is not an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step geared towards ensuring that the social media platforms are held accountable.

The theme of the event was ""Disinformation and Misinformation: The Media in the Age of Discontent"".

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of social media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Mohammed further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

He noted that social media remains a major space for the proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching in the sense of undermining democratic processes, among others.

""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists, and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings, or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratised access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation,"" he explained.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,-0.1058823529411764,448948647,1,,

Carter Verhaeghe put the Panthers ahead 3-2 with his 31st goal at 15:52 of the third but Panarin knotted the contest at 16:35 with his second of the game and team-leading 43rd of the season. He has five goals in his last two games.

Matthew Tkachuk and Eetu Luostarinen also scored for the Panthers, who lost their fourth straight game.

Adam Fox also scored for the Rangers and Vincent Trocheck had three assists.

During the shootout, Panarin beat Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky with a high shot. Mika Zibanejad also scored for the Rangers and Sam Reinhart scored for Florida. Shesterkin denied former Ranger Vladimir Tarasenko to cement the victory for the Rangers, who moved ahead of the Boston Bruins for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The Bruins lost to Philadelphia 3-2 on Saturday.

Bobrovsky finished with 34 saves.

The Rangers have won six of their last nine games against the Panthers and are 6-1-1 in their last eight home games against Florida. New York improved to 25-9-0 overall at home.

Tkachuk opened the scoring at 8:18 of the first, tipping Josh Mahura's shot past Shesterkin. Luostarinen made it 2-0 just 21 seconds into the second on a setup by Reinhart, who leads the Panthers with 80 points.

Fox narrowed the deficit on the power play at 6:22 of the second before Panarin scored at 8:23 of the middle period from a sharp angle to tie the game at 2.

Panarin had a hat trick in Thursday's 5-2 win at Boston and has 99 points this season. The 32-year-old Russian forward is trying to become the first Ranger to reach 100 points since Jaromir Jagr in 2005-06 and the seventh to reach the milestone.

Rangers rookie forward Matt Rempe played his first home game since March 11, when he was tossed from a 3-1 win over New Jersey after a high elbow on Devils defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler. Rempe was suspended four games by the league for the hit.

Florida captain Aleksander Barkov missed the contest as did defensemen Aaron Ekblad, Gustav Forsling and Dmitry Kulikov.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive John Lee signed the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Friday night, signifying that the HKSAR has fulfilled its constitutional responsibility as stipulated in the Article 23 of the Basic Law.

The long overdue local security law includes nine parts, covering offences and punishments such as treason, state secrets and espionage, sabotage endangering national security, external interference endangering national security and organization engaging in activities endangering national security.

Within the charges and penalties detailed within the ordinance, treason and insurrection carry the harshest punishments, with the maximum penalty being life in prison.

The ordinance will bring safety to society. With safety comes stability, with stability comes prosperity, Lee said as he signed into the law.

The CE also noted that a safe and stable environment is crucial to the success of businesses and enterprises, without which the private sector might suffer financial losses, and their investments and operations could be sabotaged or come under attack. Therefore, a safe and stable environment will make Hong Kong an attractive place for enterprises and investments.

The Hong Kong public warmly welcomed the ordinance, which is expected to play an important complimentary role with the National Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong, putting an end to chaotic and social turmoil driven by both local political movement and external interference.

""Security brings prosperity,"" the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) said in a social media post on Saturday morning. The national security department of the HKPF wrote that following the law coming into force, the department will fulfill its responsibilities such as collecting and analyzing intelligence related to national security, deploying, coordinating and advancing measures and actions to maintain national security and investigating criminal cases that endanger national security.

Some local lawmakers and district councilors also shared their excitement as some said they have been waiting for this moment for a long time.

""After the HKSAR had paid a heavy price for lacking the national security protection in the past, now we can focus on pushing forward the city's economic development under the full protection [of this law] now,"" a local district council member Hung Kam-in told the Global Times on Saturday.

Junior Police Officers' Association chairman Lam Chi-wai, who had witnessed the bumpy road that the Article 23 legislation had gone through over the past decades, told the Global Times on Saturday that in 2003, when Article 23 was first submitted for review by the LegCo, that he was part of the Wan Chai Police District's special task force and personally witnessed the large-scale protest against it and the eventual withdrawal of the bill.

""Since then, Hong Kong has embarked on a tumultuous path, with anti-government protests escalating day by day,"" he said, noting that in 2019, some used the anti-extradition bill protests as a pretext for unleashing widespread violence and destruction across Hong Kong, leading Hong Kong through an indelible catastrophe.

In a society where residents have deeply reflected upon their pain, the long-awaited Article 23 legislation was finally completed after 26 years, Lam said, noting that it has become a security barrier for Hong Kong, protecting it from national security threats.

After the ordinance takes effect, Secretary for Security of Hong Kong, Chris Tang Ping-keung, stated that fugitives would be the primary enforcement target under the new legislation, and an assessment will be conducted as soon as possible to determine whether to implement the restrictions on fugitives contained within the law.

The ordinance specifies that the government can impose multiple restrictions on absconders, including canceling their HKSAR passports and suspension of qualification to practice, and providing available funds or dealing with funds related to absconders is also considered illegal.

When asked whether the new ordinance restrictions on absconders would be immediately applied to former Legislative Council members like rioter Ted Hui Chi-fung and other fugitives who have fled overseas, Tang stated that this group would be a primary enforcement target.

However, the timing of enforcement and the number of individuals targeted will be assessed as soon as possible, the official noted.

The HKPF has previously issued arrest warrants for 14 Hong Kong fugitives who have fled overseas, including Hui, Nathan Law and Agnes Chow, which had played infamous roles in instigating anti-government protests and echoing the external force in interfering in Hong Kong affairs.

In explaining the urgency of legislating the ordinance, Tang said on Saturday that some countries have been smearing Hong Kong and even intensifying their intelligence efforts, so that the national security risk remains high.

Paul Lam Ting-kwok, Secretary for Justice, also said on Saturday that criticisms from countries such as Australia, the UK, and the US on the Article 23 legislation are all too similar, lacking novelty and substance, and some are even taken out of context.

The UK has an unclear definition of national secrets and Australia's laws on foreign interference are overly broad, Lam said, noting that if Hong Kong's legal provisions are considered vague, as some Western countries said, the provisions of these countries are ""extremely vague.""",globalsecurity.org,news,GlobalSecurity.org,John Pike,0.2470588235294118,448948339,1,,zho-1583199

A few years later, her work as a self-employed graphic designer slowed, so she came up with a plan to convert her two-bedroom home into a short-term rental.

""I spent all of my savings building a smaller dwelling on the property so I could rent out the main house,"" said Carter, 58, a 25-year resident of the area. She made a slew of repairs to the rental, added a hot tub and pond, became a ""superhost"" on Airbnb and could afford her more than $2,000-per-month mortgage.

Her fear now: ""I'm just going to be taxed out of my home, basically,"" she said. ""It's looking really bad for me.""

That's because Santa Fe County Assessor Isaiah Romero is reclassifying some short-term rentals from residential to nonresidential for property tax purposes this year.

The change will more than double some owners' November tax bills, the combined effect of both higher tax rates for nonresidential properties and property valuations rising to market value. A state law caps the yearly increase of residential property valuation at 3%, even if the market value has increased far more.

A Santa Fe resident with a home valued at $300,000 in 2022 would have paid about $900 more in taxes for a nonresidential property valued at the same amount.

In Carter's case, reclassification would increase her taxes from $2,688 in 2023 to $5,788 in 2024. The gap would widen from there. If her property value rose 6% per year -- an estimate given to her by a real estate agent -- she would pay more than $86,500 in taxes over the next 10 years rather than about $38,000.

Old law, new way to comply

Romero has embarked on reclassifying some short-term rentals because he said they clearly don't fit the definition for residential properties under state law. The law stipulates residential property excludes buildings ""used primarily for temporary or transient human habitation such as hotels, motels and similar structures.""

That law hasn't changed, but Romero's ability to comply with it has, he said: In 2023, Santa Fe County for the first time followed the city's lead in requiring short-term rentals to obtain business licenses and registrations.

Essentially, ""it was difficult to identify"" short-term rentals until recently, Romero said.

Last fall, the County Assessor's Office compiled a list of licensed short-term rentals in the city and county and sent questionnaires to rental owners asking about the use of the properties.

For multi-use properties with both residential and nonresidential components, such as short-term rentals where the owner lives on-site, the tax code stipulates assessors either separate the property into discrete parts -- which is not possible with Santa Fe County's tech systems, Romero said -- or determine the ""predominant use"" of the property.

His office has used data on nights rented and square footage, as reported by owners in the questionnaire, to determine the predominant use of owner-occupied short-term rentals.

If an on-site owner lives full time in a house larger than a secondary dwelling being rented out, the property will remain classified as residential regardless of the number of nights renters spend in the smaller home.

A property will also remain residential if short-term guests rent out part of the property for less than half the year, regardless of whether the rental home is smaller or larger than the portion lived in by the owner.

A ""good amount"" of short-term rentals in Santa Fe County are rented out for less than half of the year, Romero said. About 70% of rental owners responded to the questionnaire, and less than 10% of those will be reclassified as nonresidential, he said.

His office will, however, reclassify the properties of the 30% of owners who did not respond to the questionnaire.

""If you do not respond, we have to make the assumption -- right? -- that is a short-term rental. They have a license, and we are changing the classification,"" Romero said, noting the office has conducted outreach on the change via social media, the radio and four public meetings where assessors met with taxpayers individually.

Taxpayers who disagree with their property classification can file an appeal with the office online, in person or in writing after they receive their new notice of value May 1.

Generally, property owners receive a notice of value by April 1, but the County Assessor's Office asked the state Property Tax Division for an extension this year to sort through short-term rental changes, Romero said.

'We're trying to have uniformity'

Carter said she feels unreasonably punished for having chosen to live in a smaller dwelling on her property.

""I think people think [short-term rental owners] are super wealthy, and you know, we're not,"" she said. ""I am a working person ... and I'm cash poor, basically.

""If I sold the property, I could pay off all my debt and have a little money left over,"" she added, ""but the thing is, I don't want to sell my property. I'm happy here, you know?""

The county assessor ""created these rules himself based on one line of text in New Mexico law,"" Carter said, echoing a sentiment of other frustrated rental owners.

""I feel strongly, it's just really unfair what they're doing. It's just quietly happening, and it's ruining people's lives,"" she said.

Carter added, ""This basically will put us out of business, and it feels like that's what they're trying to do, is just put us all out of business.""

For Romero, there was only one reason for the decision: ""However the taxpayer chooses to utilize a property, I have to reflect that use in the classification.""

Having to determine predominant use of a property is nothing new for his office, he added. ""We utilize that same methodology for other properties, such as multi-use properties in Madrid or on Canyon Road, where you have one property used as a gallery in the front and [home] in the back.""

Santa Fe County's methods for classifying short-term rentals are backed by state law and ""extensive"" conversations with legal counsel and other assessors across the state, county Deputy Assessor Ivan Barry said.

Multiple New Mexico counties have already reclassified short-term rentals as nonresidential properties and in some cases have taxed them as such for years, said Bernalillo County Assessor Damian Lara, who serves as chairperson of the New Mexico Counties Assessors Affiliate.

With the advent of new ways to track short-term rentals, ""we're able to enforce the law better,"" Lara said. ""This is not something that we decided to do as county assessors. This is something that has been in state law for many years and other assessors have already implemented this, and ... we're trying to have uniformity across the state.""

Lara said he is ""very close"" to implementing the short-term rental change in Bernalillo County. He's had to delay the change until 2025 only because Bernalillo County does not license short-term rentals, he added, so his office must use a third-party system to identify them.

Romero said his office will use the software company Granicus to audit short-term rental use in the county throughout the year. His office requested a full-time senior appraiser to manage and audit short-term rentals and business personal property for fiscal year 2025, he added.

Tough choices for rental owners

Multiple short-term rental owners in Santa Fe said, at the very least, they need more time to adjust to a change in the tax classification of their properties, which already have reservations booked throughout this year.

""It's not like they're telling us this is what's gonna happen next year. It's like, I have to do something now,"" rental owner Maggie Lambe said.

Lambe, 61, lives in a 700-square-foot casita in the South Capitol neighborhood behind a 1,200-square-foot home she has used as a short-term rental for six years.

She bought the property about 15 years ago. The County Assessor's Office estimated a tax reclassification would raise her taxes from about $2,500 to $8,000 per year, she said.

She can't afford that increase, which has left her with the choice of either cancelling reservations this year, losing her ""superhost"" status and flipping which property she lives in or blocking off her rental for half the year and losing out on up to 50% of her rental income, she said.

For now, she has decided to get another job on top of her concierge business ""to make it through this year"" and hopes the reclassification will be overturned by a lawsuit or change in state law.

""If you live on the property, you should be able to choose which property you live in. I mean, it makes no sense at all to me,"" Lambe said. ""It's not like I'm living in Texas. ... I mean, I rely on my income to pay my bills, and they're taking that away from me.""

Carter, likewise, generally hosts guests in her rental about 200 days per year but plans to block it off late this year and lose thousands of dollars in rental income to maintain her residential tax status.

""How is leaving a property vacant for 182 or more days a benefit to anyone?"" she wrote in an email.

Elizabeth Emmens, an organizer of a grassroots group of short-term rental owners in the county, said she views the change as a continuation of an ""attack on property rights"" by the county.

Emmens was among a handful of owners who filed a lawsuit against the county's ordinance regulating rentals in 2023, claiming the regulations constituted government overreach. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Given the soaring cost of housing in Santa Fe, short-term renting is often the way young families afford a home or multigenerational families afford to keep a home, Emmens said.

""Wherever I've lived around the country, my local government never put up roadblocks to homeownership,"" she said. ""Why would you do that here in Santa Fe, when we need young people here?""

Romero emphasized the change boils down to his responsibility to follow the law.

Asked whether he expects litigation over property reclassifications, he said at least one property owner has told him they intend to sue.

""That's just me being honest,"" Romero said. ""We will see.""

Emmens declined to comment on whether she plans to file a lawsuit challenging short-term rentals' reclassification.

If people don't agree with the law, they can appeal to lawmakers to change the law, Romero noted. ""I would not be in opposition to changes; I'm merely trying to follow statute as written.""

He and Barry said all taxpayers should review their notice of value this spring to determine whether they agree with the valuation.

""A lot of times people get it and they go, 'Oh, not a bill' and they throw it away -- but it's super important,"" Barry said.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.003921568627450966,448948104,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

The former administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, in which Mohammed served as its information minister, had unsuccessfully pushed for the regulation of social media and opposed media freedoms.

The administration suspended X (then Twitter) for seven months (June 2021 to January 2022), accusing the microblogging site of supporting the October 2020 #EndSARS protests.

Speaking at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos at the weekend, Mohammed, who is also the Managing Partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, emphasised the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence.

He argued that his call is not an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step geared towards ensuring that the social media platforms are held accountable.

The theme of the event was ""Disinformation and Misinformation: The Media in the Age of Discontent"".

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of social media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Mohammed further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

He noted that social media remains a major space for the proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching in the sense of undermining democratic processes, among others.

""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists, and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings, or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratised access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation,"" he explained.",thisdaylive.com,news,THISDAYLIVE,,-0.192156862745098,448947831,1,,eng-9420039

In a move to build foreign deposits, increase their dollar liquidity and boost the country's foreign exchange reserve, private commercial banks are holding a series of roadshows abroad to promote Bangladesh as a new tax haven.

The shows are highlighting the recently passed offshore banking law that offers various benefits to foreign depositors such as tax exemptions, easy cross-border fund transfers, and relaxed financial regulations.

An offshore bank account is held in a country where the account holder does not reside. It provides the ability to handle payments, savings, and investments in multiple currencies, making it convenient for managing regular international transactions.

City Bank recently held a road show in two European countries to attract foreign investors to invest in offshore banking products that they have already developed.

The bank already designed offshore deposit products with maximum interest offering nearly 9% to attract foreign investors to park their money in offshore books in Bangladesh.

It is the first bank that launched such a campaign abroad soon after the cabinet approved the law on 28 February setting a target of building a $1 billion reserve by 2024, according to the bank.

The bank is planning to go for a massive campaign in many other countries after Eid with the primary target to reach non-resident Bangladeshis. It has trained nearly 450 employees over offshore banking operations.

IFIC Bank, another private commercial bank held a roadshow in Oldham, Manchester of UK in the second week of this month, according to the bank.

The bank is planning to set up a big campaign in New York in April targeting the huge gathering in Times Square on Bangla new year celebration. IFIC is now in the process of developing its deposit products for offshore banking.

Many other banks are also developing offshore deposit products and planning to go for massive campaigns after Eid to build foreign deposits which will increase their dollar liquidity and boost the country's foreign exchange reserve, according to industry insiders.

The size of offshore banking stood at Tk83,000 crore at the end of September last year which was equivalent to nearly $8 billion and almost the entire amount was borrowed from foreign sources, according to central bank data.

'No risk of laundering or scam'

Mashrur Arefin, managing director and CEO of City Bank, told The Business Standard that their offshore book size was nearly $450 million which was borrowed from foreign banks. There were no deposit products before the offshore banking law.

Now, City Bank has designed various deposit products with maturity from three months to five years with minimum 6.82% to maximum 8.46% interest rate, he added. Any customer staying abroad can open an offshore banking account now visiting the bank's website just filling up the account opening form.

Participants in the roadshow expressed fear about scam and monitoring by government agencies and through the roadshow, the bank tried to build their confidence clearing confusions, he said. ""The new law offers tax and duty free investment, so there will be no question about investors' money.""

He said the new offshore law is a revolutionary initiative taken by the current governor of Bangladesh Bank in a short time when the country is in prime need to build foreign currency deposits to boost reserves.

He said many countries boost their reserves through opening up offshore banking like Mauritius, and India's GIFT city.

Addressing money laundering concerns raised from various quarters, Mashrur said he does not see any risk as the law allows transactions only through bank to bank. So, the money channelling from the banks abroad will comply with the money laundering act of respective countries.

IFIC Bank's roadshow

Shah A Sarwar, managing director of IFIC Bank, said they initiated a roadshow targeting second and third-generation Bangladeshi nationals who do not hold Bangladeshi passports and are not interested in sending remittances but are seeking financial products for investment.

""We have received a very positive response following the roadshow in Manchester, UK,"" he added.

Sarwar mentioned that the bank is developing deposit products aligned with the interest rates set by the Bangladesh Bank.

The Bangladesh Bank permits banks to offer up to SOFR plus 4% to foreign lenders and depositors, encouraging them to deposit their funds in their offshore unit. Considering the current SOFR, banks can offer a maximum interest rate of 9.3% for offshore deposits.

Regarding the risk of money laundering, Sarwar said there are always legal and moral aspects to consider in international fund transfers. However, Bangladesh's offshore banking law mandates fund transfers only through banking channels, which minimises the risk.

How you can open offshore banking account

Under the new offshore banking law, both residents and non-residents can hold offshore accounts in two ways -- direct and indirect account opening options.

In the direct account opening option, a non-resident can open an offshore account directly from abroad through the respective bank's online portal. Direct account holders will manage their account by themselves.

In the indirect account, a resident Bangladeshi can open an account at a Bangladeshi branch on behalf of someone living abroad. The indirect account holder must provide an undertaking form signed by the remitter who will send remittance to that account.

Once the indirect offshore account is opened, the Bangladeshi resident can use or encash dollars anytime anywhere. They can also spend any amount abroad beyond the annual travel limit of $12,000 set by the Bangladesh Bank.

At present City bank offers both direct and indirect account opening options in offshore banking for individuals and non-individuals with depositing minimum $5,000 dollar for term deposits.

Why the offshore banking law passed in a short time

The Bangladesh Bank moved to draft the offshore banking law soon after Singapore launched a massive crackdown on money laundering in August last year in the background of some of the ultra-high net worth foreign individuals living in the country.

Some other countries including Canada and UK also moved to track illegal money sources which put some Bangladesh conglomerates in trouble with their laundered money.

For instance, a recent Bloomberg report said former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury Javed holds real estate assets in the UK alone are equivalent to at least 1% of Bangladesh's total foreign currency reserves.

When the country faced a severe decline in foreign exchange reserves, the government took immediate action after the national election held in January this year to repatriate laundered money.

A senior executive of the Bangladesh Bank, involved with drafting the offshore banking law, said the government approved the law quickly to provide a convenient means of repatriating corruption money laundered abroad.

He said certain Bangladeshi business groups faced difficulties due to illegal investments in some countries, particularly with the crackdown initiated in Singapore.

The new law will provide them with a means to repatriate money without scrutiny, granting them the benefits of a tax haven for bringing back their funds, he added.

The Offshore Banking Act 2024 was swiftly passed in Parliament on 5 March, just a week after the cabinet approved the draft.

Finance Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali introduced the bill, which was passed by a voice vote.

Earlier, while participating in the discussion on the bill, four Jatiya Party MPs including Opposition Chief Whip Mujibul Haque Chunnu, said big thieves, big fishes, political leaders, smugglers use offshore banking to make their money legal through banking in island countries like the Bahamas and thus launder the money abroad.

He also named some people from Bangladesh who have appeared in the newspaper for money laundering.

According to the law, non-resident individuals or foreign firms investing in Bangladesh can open offshore bank accounts, with transactions permitted in five currencies: US Dollar, Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan.

Many expatriates maintain bank accounts in both their home country and the country they reside in, and some also consider opening offshore accounts as an effective way to save, invest, and manage money while abroad.

India's offshore banking size

India also established a tax haven offshore Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in 2015, aiming to make it an offshore financial hub in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat.

The tech city is attracting banks, fund managers and reinsurers around the globe as many foreign fund managers such as JPMorgan are opening their offices in the city.

Foreign currency transactions are tightly regulated in India, but the GIFT receives numerous fiscal benefits. These benefits include tax exemptions on interest income paid to non-residents lending money to units in GIFT city's international finance service centre (IFSC).

Besides, the transfer of specified securities listed on IFSC exchanges by non-residents is not considered a taxable transfer, meaning gains from such transactions aren't treated as capital gains and are not taxed in India. Also, investments in GIFT enjoy exemptions from Securities Transaction Tax and Commodity Transaction Tax.

""After the Test Cricket Incentive Scheme, the BCCI is working out how we can reward players who play red-ball Ranji

Trophy cricket. The BCCI is planning to increase the match fees to give more importance to red ball cricket,"" a BCCI official told The Indian Express.

Under the Test Cricket Incentive Scheme, announced by the BCCI earlier in March, players will now get up to Rs 45 lakh incentive per Test match in addition to the Rs 15-lakh match fee.

For Ranji, the BCCI currently pays between Rs 40,000 and Rs 60,000 per day as match fee, depending on the number of games a cricketer has played across seasons. For instance, a player who plays all seven group games in a season earns approximately Rs 11.2 lakh annually.

This is below the base price for an IPL player -- Rs 20 lakh for two months of T20 cricket.

Of late, several players with IPL contracts were known to have skipped Ranji Trophy games, presumably to avoid injury or staying in shape for the cash-rich T20 league.

As reported by The Indian Express earlier, of the 165 Indian cricketers who signed up for IPL 2024, 56 did not appear for a single game in the Ranji season despite being on their state units' radar, while 25 appeared in only one.

During a recent Idea Exchange with this newspaper, cricketer R Ashwin spoke about BCCI's stand that India's top cricketers must play Ranji Trophy when not representing the country in matches with other countries.

""Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone, it might not work in favour of everyone, it might be detrimental to a few people. What we must understand here is the message being conveyed by the organisational body... that we are prioritising Test cricket, IPL is not everything as far as we are concerned. They are saying Test cricket is paramount...we are going to promote it and we expect people eligible top lay this format. In my view, they are making the right noises,"" he said.

However, he said, ""At the same time, whether a cricketer wants to do all the 12 months, or only wants to do the two months or whether they want to be relevant playing T20 cricket and one-day cricket and do not want to be playing Test cricket, is their choice.""

Yonhap

The fourth unit of the Korean-built Barakah nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates has been successfully connected to the Middle East nation's power transmission grid, Korea's state-run utility company said Sunday.

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a $20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Korea will continue to expand cooperation in the energy field with the UAE and actively seek to win more nuclear power plant projects from overseas, he added.

Image: George Osodi/Bloomberg

Nigeria removed fuel subsidies entirely in May 2023. This came as a surprise because of the political risks associated with subsidy removal. Previous administrations were reluctant to jettison the subsidies.

The subsidies had been in place since the 1970s, when the government sold petrol to Nigerians at a price below cost - though most consumers weren't aware of this.

The 1977 Price Control Act made it illegal for some products (including petrol) to be sold above the regulated price. The Olusegun Obasanjo regime introduced this law to cushion the effects of inflation, caused by a worldwide increase in energy prices.

Fuel subsidies have been controversial in Nigeria, and some analysts see them as inequitable. Very few Nigerians own vehicles.

Nigeria is among the countries with the least number of vehicles per capita, with 0.06 vehicles per person or 50 vehicles per 1 000 Nigerians.

So critics have argued that the subsidies benefited mainly the elites even though they could afford to buy fuel at market prices.

The subsidies were also considered to be a drain on public finances, costing the government US$10 billion in 2022. About 40% of Nigeria's revenue in 2022 was spent on fuel subsidies.

Fuel subsidies in Nigeria were notorious for their opacity and graft. Billions of dollars were said to have been lost through corrupt practices in the payment of the subsidies.

These are some of the reasons they were removed.

But now questions are being asked about the way it was done. In a public opinion poll conducted last year, 73% of Nigerians said they were dissatisfied with the manner in which the fuel subsidy was removed.

As an economist who has studied the Nigerian economy for over four decades, I can see why the fuel subsidy had to go.

As I argued in a previous article, fuel subsidies were bad for the Nigerian economy. They worsened budget deficits and the country's debt profile, encouraged corruption, and diverted resources away from critical sectors of the economy. They were also inequitable, transferring the national wealth to elites.

But, it has become clear from the unprecedented inflation in the country partly caused by the removal of fuel subsidies, the abrupt removal of the subsidy was not the best strategy to use.

I believe this action should have been staggered over several months. This would have provided a soft landing, and gradually exposed Nigerians to the full market price of fuel.

Doing so in one fell swoop amounts to shock therapy that is very traumatic for an already beleaguered and impoverished citizenry.

Why removing the subsidy should have been gradual

The Bola Tinubu administration could have chosen from various mechanisms to minimise the negative impact of subsidy removal.

As proposed by the World Bank, a temporary price cap would have ensured that fuel price increases did not inflict too much pain on consumers. This approach would also have enabled the government to significantly reduce, but not eliminate, the fiscal burden of the subsidy.

Another approach is periodic price adjustments: setting the price based on a moving average of previous months' import costs. These adjustments could have been made together with a price cap. The Philippines is one country that successfully removed fuel subsidies in the 1990s, using the price adjustment mechanism.

Gradually phasing out subsidies would have been a better approach for a number of reasons.

Firstly, Nigerians had become suspicious of government's intentions, given their economic experiences with the previous administration of Muhammadu Buhari. Those experiences include high inflation and unemployment rates, rising poverty and insecurity.

Tinubu should have re-established government credibility and good intentions first.

He could have offered economic succour such as cash transfers and food subsidies for poor Nigerians, wage increases for workers and retirees, scholarships or tuition waivers for indigent students in tertiary institutions, free lunches for primary and secondary students in public schools, and subsidised public transport.

After demonstrating he meant well, he should have gradually rolled out the subsidy removal. Nigerians would have been psychologically prepared for what was coming, including inflation.

The inflationary impact of subsidy removal would have been less severe. Nigerians would have been more tolerant of difficult economic policies. People will accept difficult economic policies if they know their government is humane and pro-people.

Secondly, an incremental approach would have enabled the government to come up with programmes targeted at those most likely to be hurt by subsidy removal.

This would have ensured buy-in. The ""palliatives"" introduced by the Tinubu administration and state governments are temporary and have a limited reach.

Gradual subsidy removal would have enabled the government to engage with groups that would be affected by the policy. Groups representing labour, manufacturers, students, women and others could have provided insights into what would be needed to help their members adjust.

This interactive approach would have promoted transparency and credibility in the conduct of government policies.

Many vulnerable Nigerians were already under severe economic pressure. Apart from high unemployment and poverty rates, inflation was biting very hard.

The abrupt removal of fuel subsidies, without first putting in place shock-absorbing measures, will make it more difficult for the government to achieve the policy's long-term aims: fiscal sustainability; higher levels of investment in productive sectors of the economy; economic growth; and investment in renewable energy.

Minimising the negative impact of subsidy removal

Tinubu should minimise the negative impact of subsidy removal and liberalisation of the foreign exchange market. These two phenomena interact to cause the inflation that the country is facing.

First, savings from ending the subsidy should be used to develop productive capacities in agriculture, labour-intensive manufacturing and services.

Manufacturing activities like agro-processing, textiles, footwear, leather products, arts and crafts should be targeted for development. This would generate high-paying jobs that might help Nigerians to cushion the effects of inflation.

In an economy that's functioning well, wages always adjust to reflect price increases. In Nigeria, however, too many people are either unemployed or in the informal sector, with limited opportunities to adjust their earnings to reflect inflation.

Funds saved from subsidy removal should be invested in public infrastructure (mass transportation, road construction, electricity generation, water supply).

Funds should also be used to develop people's capabilities through massive investment in health and education. Part of the savings should be used to support and sustain the student loan programme announced by the Tinubu administration.

Successful radical economic reforms, such as the ones implemented in Rwanda, usually give people an incentive to be more productive, creative and innovative. But policies that are punitive, with marginal or no benefits, are unlikely to succeed.

It remains to be seen whether Tinubu's economic policies will spur sustained and inclusive economic growth, as well as alleviate poverty.

It's top of mind because of how the Avalanche finished last season -- both with a furious charge at the end of the regular season to claim a division title that has become a source of pride, but also an early postseason exit when some of that team's flaws were exposed. A couple of recent trends might help make the answer to that question less important.

The Avalanche has been rolling lately, buttressed by a quartet of new players, the return of Valeri Nichushkin and improved play in net from both goaltenders. In a season where the expectations were clear from the jump -- Stanley Cup or bust -- how the team is playing has been more important than the results for much of the campaign.

If the Avs are playing well without overtaxing the superstars or overplaying the starting goalie, then there's little reason to change anything.

""The important thing is to be playing the right way and you're finding ways to win hockey games consistently,"" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. ""So the confidence in your team grows and you feel good about being able to come back on teams, win home and road, etc. It's important. We're not going to empty the tank, but we're going to play to win and hopefully finish at the top of this thing.""

The second part of this is how stacked the Western Conference is. The top of the Central is the best in the league -- all three teams at the top are Cup contenders -- and the Nashville Predators have surged of late and are now the most successful fourth-place team.

Even if we allow the idea that Colorado could try to win just enough or lose just enough to manipulate its position in the standings and find a favorable first-round matchup, the reality is ... there might not be one. If the Avs win the West and earn the top seed, right now that would mean facing the defending champion Vegas Golden Knights in the first round.

If they win the Central but not the West, that likely means Nashville, a club that has beaten them twice this season and is white hot with a goalie capable of stealing games. And if the Avs don't win the division, that means a first-round dogfight with Winnipeg or Dallas.

""It's still going to get you a really tough opponent,"" Bednar said. ""You finish top of the conference or top of the division and (Vegas) is who you're seeing. That's not an ideal first-round matchup. Playing Winnipeg or Dallas isn't either. You try to take the advantages you can, which is home ice.""

The Avs have been the best team on home ice this season, so getting to play four times out of seven at Ball Arena in as many series as possible could be a worthwhile goal. A recent four-game sweep on the road has also eased whatever concerns there were about the club's road struggles.

Having Game 7 at home last season didn't matter, but this is a different team. And if the first-round opponent doesn't really matter, that small psychological advantage could be the difference.

""I remember this as an opposing player, but it was always when (the Avs) got one, immediately it was 'don't let them get two,' because three and four were coming,"" Avs forward Zach Parise said. ""The building gets going. It feels like you can't breathe, because they were all over you. That's just the way it has been here with this team. Maybe it's the altitude that plays into that, but I just remember it was always hard coming in here.""

Some of the fretting about potentially having to face Vegas is what the Knights could be if everyone is healthy and playing at a peak level. That version of Vegas is terrifying, particularly with new additions that have essentially made this a $100 million roster.

That version of Vegas also hasn't shown up at an NHL rink in months. Sure, adding Noah Hanifin and Anthony Mantha makes the Knights stronger, but Tomas Hertl hasn't played since January. Mark Stone might not be ready for the first round and also hasn't played in a month.

If Vegas gets rolling and gets everyone healthy, it might be the best team in the league. It also might not have everyone available or at 100% in round one, so maybe trying to deal with the Knights immediately is actually the best time.

Or, the best way to look at it is the Avs are almost certainly going to have a tougher path this season than they did two years ago, so focusing on themselves and the process matters even more than the results and who they may or may not have to play.

""The way we're playing now, we're using four lines, pretty balanced minutes coming out of lots of games, we're using both goaltenders. ... We are going to play to win,"" Bednar said.",reporterherald.com,news,Loveland Reporter-Herald,Corey Masisak,0.5607843137254902,448943223,1,https://www.reporterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TDP-L-AVS-BLACKHAWKSAO2_1440xxx.jpg?w=640,

That's not an ideal first-round matchup. Playing Winnipeg or Dallas isn't either. You try to take the advantages you can, which is home ice.""

The Avs have been the best team on home ice this season, so getting to play four times out of seven at Ball Arena in as many series as possible could be a worthwhile goal. A recent four-game sweep on the road has also eased whatever concerns there were about the club's road struggles.

Having Game 7 at home last season didn't matter, but this is a different team. And if the first-round opponent doesn't really matter, that small psychological advantage could be the difference.

""I remember this as an opposing player, but it was always when (the Avs) got one, immediately it was 'don't let them get two,' because three and four were coming,"" Avs forward Zach Parise said. ""The building gets going. It feels like you can't breathe, because they were all over you. That's just the way it has been here with this team. Maybe it's the altitude that plays into that, but I just remember it was always hard coming in here.""

Some of the fretting about potentially having to face Vegas is what the Knights could be if everyone is healthy and playing at a peak level. That version of Vegas is terrifying, particularly with new additions that have essentially made this a $100 million roster.

That version of Vegas also hasn't shown up at an NHL rink in months. Sure, adding Noah Hanifin and Anthony Mantha makes the Knights stronger, but Tomas Hertl hasn't played since January. Mark Stone might not be ready for the first round and also hasn't played in a month.

If Vegas gets rolling and gets everyone healthy, it might be the best team in the league. It also might not have everyone available or at 100% in round one, so maybe trying to deal with the Knights immediately is actually the best time.

Or, the best way to look at it is the Avs are almost certainly going to have a tougher path this season than they did two years ago, so focusing on themselves and the process matters even more than the results and who they may or may not have to play.

""The way we're playing now, we're using four lines, pretty balanced minutes coming out of lots of games, we're using both goaltenders. ... We are going to play to win,"" Bednar said.",dailycamera.com,news,Boulder Daily Camera,Corey Masisak,0.5607843137254902,448942998,1,https://www.dailycamera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TDP-L-AVS-BLACKHAWKSAO2_1440xxx.jpg?w=640,

The Unit 4 plant began operations earlier this month and delivered the first megawatts of carbon-free electricity Saturday, according to the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO).

Its commercial operation is expected to begin this year after further tests, and Unit 4 will add another 1,400 megawatts of zero-carbon emission electricity to the UAE's grid.

The No. 4 unit is one of the four nuclear reactors built in Barakah, 270 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi, under a US$20 billion contract won by a KEPCO-led consortium in 2009. The project marked South Korea's first export of a homegrown commercial atomic power plant.

When the four units are in commercial operation, the Barakah plant will produce up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs and is expected to help guarantee the UAE's energy sustainability and achieve its net-zero goals, KEPCO said.

""We've taken a step closer to the successful completion of the UAE reactor project. We will continue to do our best to ensure its success,"" KEPCO chief Kim Dong-cheol said.

Credits: Newshub

Labour leader Chris Hipkins says now is the time to have a debate about New Zealand's tax system, saying currently it's ""inequitable"", ""unsustainable"" and ""broken"".

Hipkins' comments came in his first major speech as Opposition Leader on Sunday.

""Yes, we need to talk about tax,"" he said, speaking at AUT's Manukau South Campus.

""We have one of the least diversified tax systems in the world, meaning public investment into things like health, education, welfare, housing and infrastructure is more reliant on income tax than most other countries we compare ourselves to.

""In other words, those who earn their living through their salary and wages are contributing a greater share than those who earn income through wealth. Under this Government, those with multiple investment properties are getting huge tax breaks while those on salary and wages pay tax on every dollar they earn.""

Hipkins also noted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calling an overhaul of New Zealand's tax system to bolster investment, productivity and fairer.

""As the way we live and work continues to change, with a smaller proportion of the workforce earning taxable salary and wages, reform of our tax system won't just be a matter for the idealists, it will be an economic necessity,"" Hipkins warned.

""Now is the time to have that debate. After the election I said that all options around changes to the tax system were back on the table and I meant it.""

Ahead of the 2023 election, Hipkins ruled out introducing a capital gains or wealth tax.

""I'm confirming today that under a Government I lead there will be no wealth or capital gains tax after the election. End of story,"" he said in July last year.

""With many Kiwi households struggling, now is simply not the time for a big shake-up of our tax system.""

However, after the election loss, the party put tax reform back on the table.

Now, Hipkins says his party is set to release a series of discussion documents on key issues it will be working on over the next two years - one of those will be on tax.

""It will set out some of our options for future tax policy. It's intended to help inform the debate, but how we shape it will be up to us,"" he said on Sunday.

Hipkins' comments come as he hit back at the new National-led coalition Government, calling it ""heartless and cruel"", and accused it of running the nation like a business rather than country.

""Our country is not a company and our citizens are not just consumers,"" he said.

""More people smoking might be good for the Government's bottom line but it won't make for a healthier society. Cutting school lunches and support for those with disabilities might help [Finance Minister] Nicola Willis balance the Budget, but at what cost to those who will miss out?""

Hipkins said he accepts New Zealanders voted for change at the last election, but asked whether the change they are getting is the change they voted for.

""This Government's lower spending goal simply means they take from the many to give to the few - and life will only get worse for most people,"" he said.

""This National-led Government believes its role is to do things to people rather than with them. It is a Government of entrenched privilege and entitlement.

""Our country is not a company, and it shouldn't be governed as if it is... Not every Government decision comes down to what is best for the bottom line.

""Kiwis deserve a Government that puts people first. We deserve a Government that backs Kiwis to come together to support and help each other to thrive.""",newshub.co.nz,news,Newshub,,0.1764705882352942,448941407,1,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2024/03/labour-leader-chris-hipkins-says-new-zealand-needs-to-fix-broken-tax-system/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1711244538885/getty-hipkins-1120.jpg,eng-9421023

This happens whether or not income growth puts taxable income into a higher marginal rate bracket.

Historically, governments of both stripes have allowed this mechanism to keep going until average rates - and marginal rates at average incomes - became so high that the burden became politically intolerable. This is when we finally get tax cuts.

One important test of such cuts is how much they do to offset past bracket creep.

On this issue, various claims were made about the Coalition government's three-stage personal income tax plan that began in 2018-19 and was to be completed this July.

The focus has always been on stage three; how it delivered a $9000 gain to high-income earners and allegedly over-compensated them for bracket creep.

This was despite stage one concentrating tax cuts on lower incomes, and high incomes not receiving significant relief from bracket creep since 2010-11.

Simple comparisons of average tax rates in 2024-25 with those in 2017-18 - just before the tax cut plan started - did reveal a reduction in average rates from around $90,000 compared with seven years ago.

However, such calculations fail to take into account the extra tax paid in each of those years as a result of bracket creep. Indeed, this failure of measurement applies at all income levels.

Using a more comprehensive methodology, CIS research has recalculated the cumulative effect of bracket creep and discretionary tax cuts over those seven years and found that even under the Coalition's original plan, the main beneficiaries of tax policy since 2017-18 have been those on incomes between $50,000 and $224,000.

Far from ""$9000 gifts to the rich"", those with incomes above $224,000 are slightly worse off over the period - and that's if they had received the original stage three tax cuts in full.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts

The Albanese government's re-design of stage three lowers the range of incomes that have been over-compensated for bracket creep to around $48,500-$214,000, and also delivers a cut to those on $34,000-$39,700 they would not otherwise have received.

However, if we look back further to 2010-11 - the year the last major tranche of tax cuts were fully implemented - the results are dramatically different.

The Coalition's three-stage plan undercompensates everyone above $35,000; while Labor's revision increases the extent of undercompensation above about $146,000 and slightly reduces it below that level.

The conclusion is that while any government is free to shape the distribution of a tax cut as it sees fit, relief from bracket creep is one important criterion, which provides no justification for the Albanese government's stage three renovations.

As a result, the bottoms of the 37 per cent and 45 per cent brackets ($135,000 and $190,000) will become pressure points sooner than otherwise.

Second, to the extent some taxpayers are being over-compensated for past bracket creep, future bracket creep will eventually devour that benefit.

The government's stage three tinkering might buy those taxpayers who benefit some more time, but not much.

Third, if thresholds were indexed to inflation annually, relatively small reductions to tax would be made each year thereby avoiding the accumulation of revenue to fund larger but illusory ""tax cuts"" every several years.

Discretionary tax cuts under indexed tax brackets are genuine tax cuts - not merely the return of the additional money the government had taken in previous years.

And fourth, if indexation is not adopted in future (and there is no sign that it will be) there has to be a better understanding that under the practice of widely spaced discretionary tax cuts, larger absolute dollar cuts at higher incomes are necessary unless average tax rates are to increase inexorably above a certain income level.

Over time, that ""certain"" level will become lower in real terms, capturing an increasing number of taxpayers; with all that implies for the effect of the tax system on incentive and aspiration.",afr.com,news,Australian Financial Review,,-0.2156862745098039,448941401,1,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2856%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/339ac969c87b7c54a552aa731bba749a46922fda,

This move is aimed at increasing the number of tax files and ultimately enhancing transparency in the taxation system, they added. They also noted that this is a move to increase the disposable income of citizens struggling for the past few months.

Starting February 1, 2024, mandatory income tax registration for citizens above 18 was announced by the Presidential Media Division, with only those earning over Rs. 100,000 per month liable to pay. Obtaining a tax registration number becomes essential for routine activities, aiming to enhance transparency in the taxation system.

The government's efforts to increase the number of tax files have shown some success, with the number rising from 437,547 in 2022 to 1,002,029 by the end of 2023. However, there is still a need for further increase to achieve the government's objectives.

In addition to increasing the number of tax files, the government has also been successful in increasing the state revenue as a percentage of the GDP. It has risen from 8 per cent in the past year to 10 per cent by the end of last year. The government aims to further elevate this figure to 12 per cent by the end of 2024 and set a target of reaching 15 per cent by 2025, indicating its commitment to establishing a stable economy.

Over the past two years, teams like the Georgia Bulldogs and Kansas City Chiefs have somehow played the ""no one believed in us"" card even though they were heavy favorites on their way to championships.

North Carolina doesn't care what anyone has to say. It doesn't matter to the Tar Heels that many actually have doubted them. Heading into the NCAA Tournament, they ranked below not just the other three No. 1 seeds, but the No. 2 seed in their own region.

Perhaps after a standout 85-69 win over No. 9 Michigan State, a blueblood and a top-20 team by KenPom rankings, the odds will start to reflect North Carolina as a true national championship contender.

""Whoever opinions that they don't think that we can win or win big-time games then that's on them,"" senior guard RJ Davis said after Saturday's win. ""We don't really care about what is being said about us because we know within the locker room this team believes in each other and we know we're capable of doing great, big things.

""Obviously we can't control the noise, we can't control if people are picking us to win games or what not but we can control our mindset and our approach to the games and I think we're doing a good job kinda just -- Coach (Hubert) Davis always talks about ignoring all types of distractions and just focus on what's next and that's what we did today.""

Live NCAA bracket news | TV schedule | Predictor tool

When the March Madness field was set, North Carolina was as much an underdog as any No. 1 seed can truly be. Connecticut had the best odds to win the national championship at +350. Houston was next up at +600. Purdue was third at +650. Then a stunner, No. 2 seed Arizona at +1100. Fifth came the Tar Heels at +1300.

Odds to make the Final Four out of the West? Arizona led at +260. Then, North Carolina came in second at +300.

Those odds haven't changed much. Following Saturday's win, BetMGM's odds still show North Carolina fifth behind the aforementioned teams. Somehow, the odds have gotten longer at +1400.

On paper, all North Carolina did was beat a No. 9 seed while playing in its home state. But KenPom listed Michigan State as the No. 16 team in the country entering the contest. NCAA's Net Rankings had Michigan State No. 24. The Spartans thrashed No. 8 Mississippi State 69-51 in the first round. It's also a team coached by Tom Izzo.

Davis voiced the respect he has for Michigan State after the win, but said the entire season has shown the Tar Heels have what it takes to make noise in March. Winning an ACC regular-season title and handling their non-conference schedule the way they did already showed him enough to know before Saturday the ceiling his team possesses.

""Michigan State is always Michigan State. It's extremely well-coached. I can't have any more respect for a coach than I have for Coach Izzo. His program, the way he runs his program, the type of teams, the way that they play. So we knew what we were getting today,"" Hubert Davis said. ""We've been in tough physical matchups, highly competitive competitions like today. So it just continues to build confidence for us moving forward, but not just particularly for this game, but for what we had to do the entire season.""

HISTORY OF UPSETS BY SEED:

16 vs. 1 | 15 vs. 2 | 14 vs. 3 | 13 vs. 4 | 12 vs. 5

North Carolina has two of the biggest stars in the sport in RJ Davis and Armando Bacot. They shined again on Saturday, notching 20 and 18 points each.

It was more than just the two stars. Harrison Ingram made five 3-pointers in a 17-point game. Cormac Ryan found success throughout the night driving to the paint and drawing fouls, earning 14 points, including six from the charity stripe. Seth Trimble played lights-out defense, picking up a pair of key blocks.

And while the box score showed a dominant win, North Carolina faced early adversity. The Spartans punched first, leading by as much as 12 over 10 minutes into the game. North Carolina struggled to make any shots from long range and were getting physically out-matched in the paint.

""They punched first. Their physicality, their will, their want to, the first 10 minutes of the game just overwhelmed us. They were catching the ball wherever they wanted to, close to the basket on the block. They were getting layups, second-chance opportunities. Defensively they were pushing us off our screens, our spots. They were just playing better than us,"" Hubert Davis said. ""We came into the huddle and said, look, we can't talk about any basketball stuff until we join the fight. Once that started, the level of play in terms of the energy and effort, the attention to detail rose. Then that's when things started to change.

""We always talk about how do you react and how do you respond? And these guys, the whole team reacted and responded the right way after going down 14 in the first half.""

By all accounts, it was a statement win to the rest of the college basketball world to notice the Tar Heels. For the team itself, it was another win in a season that has already demanded plenty of respect.

It's a strange paradox. There is general appreciation that poverty is on the decline. It is driven by robust development spending by the government, and a marked trickle-down effect.

After ruling out wealth and capital gains taxes at last year's election, Chris Hipkins now says tax system reform is an ""economic necessity"" as the Labour leader recommits to putting all options ""back on the table.""

He made the remarks in an address to party members, billed as being about his party's ""values"" and as his ""first major speech as opposition leader"".

Hipkins' comments today are the strongest commitment to tax system reform since he began in the job of Labour leader. Following the election last year, he said tax options for the 2026 election would be back on the table.

However, he stopped short of endorsing specific changes, instead saying his caucus would work through options over the next two years, with the release of a ""series of discussion documents"".

""One of those will be on tax. It will set out some of our options for future tax policy. It's intended to help inform the debate, but how we shape it will be up to us,"" Hipkins said.

""Our work on future policy will take some time, as it should, because none of the issues I just mentioned can be considered in isolation. We will use our time in opposition to listen, to build relationships, to research and to develop new ideas and new policies.""

The party leader also spoke about what he called the coalition's ""disgusting barrage"" on Māori issues, opposition to the Government's smokefree law changes, and reflecting on the upcoming 40th anniversary of the David Lange government.

Hipkins said: ""Our current economic model celebrates those who live off wealth over those who live off work. In the modern economy, contribution and reward aren't as linked as they used to be.

""Hard work is no longer the ticket to getting ahead it should be. While some earn a lot more than they are worth, the majority are worth a lot more than they earn.

""Success and aspiration should be celebrated. But when hard work no longer pays off, it's time for a rethink of the system.""

Hipkins continued: ""Now is the time to have that debate. After the election, I said that all options around changes to the tax system were back on the table, and I meant it.""

He explained his position: ""Our current tax system is inequitable, and it's unsustainable.

""We have one of the least diversified tax systems in the world, meaning public investment into things like health, education, welfare, housing and infrastructure is more reliant on income tax than most other countries we compare ourselves to.

Isn't that something we'd benefit from?

Prosper Australia is a not-for-profit, membership-based think tank.

If you haven't heard of it, here's some quick background.

The group was founded in Victoria in 1890 and it's been publishing its journal, Progress, since 1904.

Its members draw on insights from economists such as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and most significantly Henry George, to explain how policymakers could slash taxes on labour and businesses.

They say Australia's tax system has things backwards.

They say we punish effort by over-taxing earned income from honest work, investment and innovation, and we reward rent-seeking and speculation by under-taxing unearned income from the private ownership of land, natural resources and monopolistic advantage.

They say if we properly taxed economic rents, unearned income, and supernormal profits, we could shift the tax base away from our over-reliance on taxes on production and job creation. It would also put a handbrake on some drivers of inequality.

""The essence is that production and job creation should be relieved of tax, while economic rents should be captured for society at large,"" they argue.

""This is inherently attractive for those prioritising economic outcomes by way of lower company, payroll and income tax. It is pro-individual and pro-business.""

They illustrate their argument with this graphic:

They say the tax shift they're talking about could also help to fix our housing crisis and protect the environment.

""We should protect our environment by pricing pollution and extraction, so that none of us are taking away from the birthright of all.""

If you think you've heard similar arguments before, you probably have.

Last month, former treasury secretary Ken Henry warned Australia's tax system had deteriorated so much in the last couple of decades that he was worried about our ""social compact"" holding together.

He said intergenerational unfairness was now embedded in our tax system, and that housing, the state of climate policy, and the Commonwealth's over-reliance on taxing workers' incomes were three areas of major policy failure.

""Over time, we've got to place less reliance on personal income tax, and company tax, and payroll tax,"" he said.

""In cutting the company tax rate, which we need to do, we also have to find a way at the same time of getting more revenue out of the country's exhaustible natural resources, particularly fossil fuels.""

Dr Henry said our unsatisfactory taxation of land was a big problem, and he'd like to see stamp duties on land abolished and replaced with an annual property tax.

And the economist Ross Garnaut has said similar things.

In September last year, Professor Garnaut delivered the keynote speech at Prosper Australia's annual Henry George Commemorative Dinner, where he said Australia was increasingly dominated by powerful firms that were extracting ""economic rents"" from our economy, and we had to do something about it.

""Economic rent"" differs from the normal meaning of the word ""rent,"" which refers to a payment you make for the temporary right to use a good, like renting a car.

In contrast, economic rent has to do with the abuse of one's power and privilege in the marketplace.

For example, when an individual or business has exclusive ownership over an asset and they use that positional advantage to extract more money from people than they otherwise could if they faced proper competition, they're extracting economic rent.

Professor Garnaut said if you added up all of the opportunities for economic reform to reduce economic rents in Australia's economy, or to tax them efficiently and equitably, you'd have a ""transformational economic reform program.""

""Now is the time to focus on the rise of rents, policy to slow or reverse the increase, and taxation reform to secure for the public revenue part of the rents that cannot be removed by sound policy.""

Which brings us to Prosper Australia's new report.

It's titled ""Buying better income taxes with better land taxes: How to cut taxes for Australia's highest-taxed workers.""

It was written by economists Tim Helm and Cameron Murray.

Dr Helm and Dr Murray say the tax reform debate in Australia this year has focused on who wins and loses from changes to the ""Stage 3"" tax cuts.

But genuine tax reform, they say, will only come from replacing bad taxes with good taxes -- from changing our ""tax mix.""

To explain what they mean, they say Australia's states and territories could raise an extra $27 billion in tax revenue each year, without reducing investment or economic growth, if they were smarter about land taxation.

That money could fund a universal income of more than $1,000 per Australian.

It could fund a 10 per cent reduction in the personal income tax take.

Or it could be used to reduce the high effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) and disincentives to work that are created by our strict means-testing of welfare payments.

And they look more closely at that third option.

They say Australia's strict means-testing of welfare payments (where payments are deliberately reduced for recipients as their private incomes rise) often discourages recipients from taking on work or increasing their hours at work.

We're talking about the age pension, the parenting payment, JobSeeker, and the disability support pension, among others.

They say withdrawing welfare payments for people as their incomes rise is economically identical to taxing income, and in Australia withdrawal or ""taper"" rates for many welfare payments are as high as 50 or 60 per cent.

When combined with income taxation, those high taper rates produce ""extraordinarily high"" effective marginal tax rates for struggling workers, which can create ""poverty traps"" for people on low incomes.

""Childcare costs on top of income tax and welfare withdrawal can produce work disincentives twice as large as those imposed by the top income tax rate. The Productivity Commission and Grattan Institute have shown that in some circumstances parents can even be penalised for working at all, with some EMTRs exceeding 100 per cent.

""The steep rate of pension withdrawal also discourages older workers: only 26 per cent of Australians aged 65-69 participate in the workforce, compared to 40 per cent in New Zealand where the pension is not means-tested,"" they say.

They model the approximate cost of reducing taper rates on all major welfare payments, as well as Family Tax Benefit.

They estimate the additional $27 billion that would be raised from best-in-class land taxation and value capture could fund a halving of welfare taper rates with no reduction in maximum payments for recipients.

""For the one million Australians currently on welfare part-payments this would deliver an effective tax cut of 20 to 30 cents per additional dollar earned,"" they say.

""For most recipients, this would more than double their net-of-tax return to working more hours. For these people, primarily in the low-to-middle income range up to $70,000, this change would boost incomes by roughly $4,000 to $7,000 per year, even before accounting for additional work effort.

""For another 800,000 or so Family Tax Benefit part-recipients, a halving of taper rates would reduce EMTRs by 6 to 12 cents per dollar earned.

""With the addition of these taxpayers and others on higher incomes who would now qualify for welfare payments or FTB, it is likely that 3 million or more Australian workers would benefit from this change,"" they argue.

But let's wrap things up.

They say their proposal demonstrates what could be delivered with modest tax mix reform.

They leave us to imagine what could be achieved with a comprehensive tax mix reform program for the whole country.

But where, exactly, would that $27 billion a year come from that they're talking about?

They say some states and territories tax land better than others, but the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) stands out for its unique system of rezoning value capture.

They say the ACT prices rezoning via its Lease Variation Charge (LVC), which captures 75 per cent of the windfall gains landowners would otherwise receive from permission to redevelop at higher density.

Adjusting for property values and transaction volumes, they estimate that if other state governments were to capture value uplift by pricing rezoning as the ACT does, they could raise a collective $12 billion each year.

And if the states were to use efficient land taxes to meet the ACT benchmark for regular taxes on land they could raise a further $15 billion.

""In total, if all states achieved best-in-class taxation of land they would raise an additional $27 billion in revenue each year, without reducing investment or growth,"" Dr Helm and Dr Murray say.

They say land taxes are efficient because they are paid out of economic rents (i.e. income in excess of effort), they reduce land values without reducing the quantity of land available, and they can increase the amount of land put to productive use.

State governments have access to the land base for taxation, they say, but they underuse it and rely heavily on Commonwealth grants funded by less efficient taxes on work and investment instead.

""This results in a complex and inefficient system, as well as a fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and states which dilutes accountability for spending,"" they say.

They say the effects of high EMTRs and the merits of better taxing land are both well known issues, but they're challenging to address in isolation - EMTRs for the cost, and land taxes for the politics.

It makes reform driven by the Commonwealth an attractive option, they say (rebalancing revenue between levels of government is an administrative matter which the Commonwealth could initiate).

""This indicative proposal demonstrates what could be delivered with modest tax mix reform that goes no further than lifting all states up to an existing benchmark,"" they say.

""Even modest changes in land taxation could pay for substantial reform.""

Under the guidance of Madhave Rao, associate professor and faculty-in-charge of labs, , , , and , achieved this feat. Their IT solution incorporates gas sensors for real-time monitoring of food freshness, employing advanced machine learning algorithms to analyse the sensor data. With a threshold-based assessment mechanism, it accurately determines food edibility.

This solution not only enhances food management practices for both consumers and industries but also promotes proactive measures. The gas sensor technology efficiently detects freshness and impurities, enabling producers to optimise the handling and sale of perishable goods, all while ensuring consumer safety and satisfaction.

About their solution, Bhutada said, ""Our product uses MQ-2 gas sensors, which are known for their cost-effectiveness as well as robust results. The MQ sensor's working principle involves detecting changes in electrical conductivity when specific gases come into contact with the sensor's sensing element. Other sensors used work on 'mems'(micro-electromechanical systems) technology. These sensor readings are then passed through a regression model, which outputs a score from 0-100, indicating the degree of freshness of the underlying product. Regression is a supervised machine-learning technique that is used to predict continuous outcomes.""

This solution was developed while participating in a national-level hackathon, ""HACK4TKM,"" where they secured third place. Bhutada added, ""From the freshness score, producers owning large-scale storage facilities can monitor the health of their product in real-time, thus helping them in the effective transport and sale of food before it gets spoiled. We have made a mobile application as an interface for storage facility owners to access real-time data and results.""",bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com,news,Bangalore Mirror,,0.2941176470588236,448937373,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-103404,msid-108738773/108738773.jpg",

The increase comes during a cost of living crisis and after London drivers had to face the expansion of ULEZ last year.

The DVLA has confirmed that the rates of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), commonly called road tax, will rise from April 1.

This will see payments for most drivers increase by the RPI rate of inflation - likely around 6%.

VED is a tax levied on every vehicle using public roads in the UK and the rate is set to increase in line with inflation.

Tax expert Andy Wood, of Tax Natives, told the Express has provided a breakdown of what the extra costs might look like.

Andy said: ""For cars registered before March 1, 2001, tax rules differ significantly. Instead of CO2 emissions, taxation is based solely on engine size.

""Vehicles with engines under 1.5 litres (specifically 'not over 1549cc') incur an annual tax of £200, while larger engines are taxed at £325.

""Verifying engine specifications when considering older vehicles is essential, as rates may vary. These rates are subject to potential increases, likely from April 2024.

He also told The Sun: ""Individuals relying on traditional fuel types may need to allocate additional funds to their vehicle taxes, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds.

""Vehicle taxation costs vary based on age and environmental impact.""

Some experts think the charges will rise by six per cent overall.

HMRC has previously confirmed the rates are increasing to make sure the levies remained the same in real terms.

The UK operates three systems of VED, depending on when your vehicle was registered.

The newest, introduced in 2017, is itself split into two rates - one for your first year on the road based on emissions and then a second for after the first year based on the cost of the car.

Andy explained that cars registered after April of that year will face a £10 increase in their first-year payments at the lowest emissions range.

More polluting models could see the first-year rate rise up to £2,745 - an increase of £140 on last year.

The second rate is set to remain the same, with a flat rate of £190 (or £180 for ""alternative fuel vehicles"").

However, the additional Expensive Car Supplement, paid for five years on cars worth over £40,000, is rising from £390 to £410.

Motors registered between 2001 and 2017 are taxed based purely on emissions.

From April, the most polluting cars will see their rate rise from £695 to £735, while lower bands could see a spike of between £20 and £35.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) RJ Davis scored 20 points to help North Carolina beat Michigan State 85-69 in the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, pushing the Tar Heels to the Sweet 16 while keeping them unbeaten in March Madness against Spartans Hall of Fame coach Tom Izzo.

Harrison Ingram made five 3-pointers and scored 17 points for the West Region's top seed, which continued its NCAA success in its home state. UNC (29-7) ran off 17 straight points during a 23-3 run over the last eight minutes of the first half to erase a 12-point deficit, then continued answering every push by the Spartans after halftime.

The Tar Heels improved to 5-0 in the tournament against Izzo, including victories in the 2005 Final Four and 2009 title game. And they move on to the regional semifinals in Los Angeles, where they will face either Grand Canyon or Alabama on Thursday night.

UNC also got a strong showing inside from Armando Bacot (18 points), who got into the paint to score, draw fouls or kick out against oncoming double teams. Ingram was on the receiving end of some of those, knocking down 5 of 7 3-pointers to go with seven rebounds.

Tyson Walker scored 24 points for the ninth-seeded Spartans (20-15), who were playing what amounted to a road game in front of a blue-clad crowd about a 2 1/2-hour drive from UNC's Chapel Hill campus.

One of Ingram's 3s seemed destined to miss when it caught iron, only to somehow take a soft lap all the way around the rim and drop through the net - sending Ingram screaming toward the UNC bench and giving UNC a 69-57 lead with 6:18 left.

That lead grew to as many as 17 and never again fell below double digits.

The Spartans came out with toughness, taking the action to the Tar Heels behind a heater of a start with Walker scoring 11 points in the first 10 1/2 minutes. And when Malik Hall scored on a pivot spin against Jae'Lyn Withers inside, Michigan State led 28-17 at the 8:08 mark.

That's when the Tar Heels finally rose to match the Spartans' competitive edge.

Ingram hit a 3 to start the 17-0 burst that included multiple baskets and free throws from Bacot. Cormac Ryan nailed another 3 from the corner in a side-reversing sequence that started in the paint with Bacot, while Ingram hit one more that pushed the Tar Heels to a 40-31 lead at the break.

BIG PICTURE

Michigan State: It was a bumpy season for a team that opened the season ranked No. 4 in the AP Top 25 but was unranked before the end of November and remained that way the rest of the year. The Spartans had wins against NCAA 3-seeds Illinois and Baylor, but they didn't have better than a three-game winning streak after the start of 2024 and had lost five of seven entering March Madness. They turned in a strong effort to roll past eighth-seeded Mississippi State on Thursday, but - in a repeat of their season-long inconsistency - couldn't repeat it for 40 minutes.

UNC: The Tar Heels advanced by beating 16th-seeded Wagner with an easy dominance in the paint against an undersized team. They had a tougher fight in this one but improved to 36-2 in NCAA games in North Carolina, including 14-1 in Charlotte, the state's largest city.

UP NEXT

The Tar Heels learn their opponent Sunday. UNC owns an 8-5 record against the fourth-seeded Crimson Tide and has never met the 12th-seeded Antelopes.

The increase comes during a cost of living crisis and after London drivers had to face the expansion of ULEZ last year.

The DVLA has confirmed that the rates of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), commonly called road tax, will rise from April 1.

This will see payments for most drivers increase by the RPI rate of inflation - likely around 6%.

VED is a tax levied on every vehicle using public roads in the UK and the rate is set to increase in line with inflation.

Tax expert Andy Wood, of Tax Natives, told the Express has provided a breakdown of what the extra costs might look like.

Andy said: ""For cars registered before March 1, 2001, tax rules differ significantly. Instead of CO2 emissions, taxation is based solely on engine size.

""Vehicles with engines under 1.5 litres (specifically 'not over 1549cc') incur an annual tax of £200, while larger engines are taxed at £325.

""Verifying engine specifications when considering older vehicles is essential, as rates may vary. These rates are subject to potential increases, likely from April 2024.

He also told The Sun: ""Individuals relying on traditional fuel types may need to allocate additional funds to their vehicle taxes, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds.

""Vehicle taxation costs vary based on age and environmental impact.""

Some experts think the charges will rise by six per cent overall.

HMRC has previously confirmed the rates are increasing to make sure the levies remained the same in real terms.

The UK operates three systems of VED, depending on when your vehicle was registered.

The newest, introduced in 2017, is itself split into two rates - one for your first year on the road based on emissions and then a second for after the first year based on the cost of the car.

Andy explained that cars registered after April of that year will face a £10 increase in their first-year payments at the lowest emissions range.

More polluting models could see the first-year rate rise up to £2,745 - an increase of £140 on last year.

The second rate is set to remain the same, with a flat rate of £190 (or £180 for ""alternative fuel vehicles"").

However, the additional Expensive Car Supplement, paid for five years on cars worth over £40,000, is rising from £390 to £410.

Motors registered between 2001 and 2017 are taxed based purely on emissions.

From April, the most polluting cars will see their rate rise from £695 to £735, while lower bands could see a spike of between £20 and £35.

Then, for cars registered before 2001, the tax is based on engine size.

Cars under 1549cc will now be charged a flat rate of £200, while larger engines will incur a £325 payment.

Fortunately, there are five key exemptions which could see thousands of Brits pay no tax at all.

From April 1 2025, EVs from after 2017 will be required to pay VED at the same rate as the lowest band petrol or diesel models in the first year and then the standard rate from there on.

However, only 1.5 quintals of this waste from the Kashi Vishwanath temple is being properly disposed of by converting them into incense sticks (agarbatti) and other products.

Recognising the immense potential for utilising floral waste from other temples, officials are now strategising with the NGO managing the KV temple's waste. The demand for agarbattis, havan material, and other products made from recycled flowers is high, even in countries like the US.

""Currently, a single floral water recycling unit operates under the management of the Sai Institute of Rural Development (SIRD),"" said chief development officer Himanshu Nagpal on Saturday. ""This organisation empowers rural women by training them in recycling floral waste and creating various products.""

However, the current collection volume is meager compared to the vast amount of floral waste generated. Most of this waste ends up dumped with regular garbage, polluting rivers and water bodies. The government has pledged its full support to SIRD, acknowledging the significant potential for employment generation, particularly for women.

""Our parent organisation, Yuva Gramya Samity, established a unit at our Basni campus with technical assistance from CIMAP (Lucknow) and cooperation from SIDBI,"" said Ajay Singh, SIRD director. ""This initiative aimed to empower rural women by providing them with a livelihood opportunity through the production of agarbatti, dhoop, havan material, herbal soaps, candles, and even vermicompost, all made from recycled floral waste.""

Despite the growing demand for these eco-friendly products, the raw material consumption remains low compared to the readily available floral waste in the temple town. ""Currently, we collect only 1.5 quintals of floral waste from the Kashi Vishwanath temple, while the volume generated by this temple alone is significantly higher,"" said Singh. He further highlighted the high demand for their products due to the exclusive use of KV temple's floral waste.

""We approached the Varanasi Municipal Corporation for assistance in collecting floral waste from other temples, but they expressed their inability due to the lack of a separate collection system,"" Singh added.

""Interestingly, NRIs settled in California (US) have purchased our products, and we've received requests to ship them for a Hindu convention planned there,"" Singh further said. Additionally, some mega-stores in Noida and Gurgaon are preparing to introduce these products under the brand name 'Hunar-e-Banaras'.

""Recognising the vast potential in this sector, especially considering the daily generation of tonnes of floral waste from the city's numerous prominent temples, we have decided to strategise for its effective utilisation,"" said Nagpal. He recently inaugurated a waste floral recycling center operated by SIRD and flagged off a flower collection van donated by a social organisation.

Singh elaborated on the CDO's encouragement to collect floral waste from other locations like Markandeya Mahadev temple. They are also developing resources to increase collection and train more women to participate in the floral waste recycling production process. ""We have already trained 200 women who are now earning a livelihood in this sector,"" said Singh.

""Following the CDO's initiative, we will hold workshops near all major temples generating high volumes of floral waste. These workshops will train women from nearby areas and engage them in the production of various articles using recycled floral waste.""",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Rajeev Dikshit,-0.2156862745098039,448935657,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108742098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28146,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",

Yet they didn't recall getting income or benefit services.

""What would I owe for? they asked on a subreddit for Social Security.

""I work two jobs, even my tax returns never surpass that amount.""

The Reddit community offered plenty of different suggestions.

One person suggested the user was probably unaware their guardians were the ones who received child support for them.

""Likely your parents received benefits for you as a child,"" they wrote. ""This is unfortunately common.""

""That's not good for me to hear,"" the user responded.

They explained how their adoptive family had a dysfunctional household and was very poor.

""She filed to extend the child care payments from DCF when I turned 18 and got approved cuz low SES,"" they wrote, not specifying whether 'she' was their mother.

DCF or The Disability Control File is an electronic database storing information about disability benefits, according to SSA.gov.

On top of the family's low socioeconomic status, the user said they got kicked out when they were 18 and have been independent since.

""Would this have an effect?""

Redditors replied telling the user they could request having their overpayment waived since it wasn't their fault.

""You need to fill out form SSA 632, which you can print off from their website or they can send it to you,"" they said.

They also said to ask for a copy of the overpayment notice.

""Yeah I never received it in the mail, oddly enough,"" the user noted.

""I saw the balance on the SSA site when I was checking it for a completely unrelated reason.

Another user said they had posted about a similar situation before realizing their parents claimed disability.

""It was then determined I was, in fact, not disabled and those payments are now considered overpayments,"" they said.

""It only took them 30 years to tell me. Now I have to file a request for reconsideration.""

Those who owe an overpayment to Social Security can submit a Request for Waiver of Overpayment recovery form.

In the end, though, top-seeded North Carolina was too good for the Spartans to handle as the Tar Heels ended Michigan State's season with a 85-69 defeat.

The seniors gave it all they had. Tyson Walker had a game-high 24 points, Malik Hall added 17 points and nine rebounds. But Michigan State couldn't contain Armando Bacot inside and North Carolina's guards.

RJ Davis had 20 points, Bacot had 18 points and seven rebounds and Harrison Ingram posted 17 points and five 3s to help North Carolina punch its ticket to the Sweet 16 a year after the Tar Heels missed the Tournament entirely.

Michigan State had it all working in their favor early on. The Spartans were playing on another level. They were energized and locked in. Their shots were falling early. Michigan State was out-hustling, out-rebounding and out-doing the Tar Heels in just about every way.

Walker and Hall got going early as the Spartans' offense was humming and overwhelming the Tar Heels. Even Mady Sissoko made some post-up moves on 6-foot-11 Bacot.

It couldn't have been going better for Michigan State, who finally looked like the team Izzo believed it'd be all season.

Walker hit back-to-back leads to make it 26-14 with 9:37 left in the first half and stunned a mostly Carolina blue crowd.

But the Spartans crumbled like an aluminum can over the final nine minutes.

Michigan State reverted back to its old ways. Turnovers. Defensive lapses. A lengthy scoring drought. It was all too much for the Spartans to overcome.

Michigan State went nearly six minutes as North Carolina started to take over, feeding off the energy provided by a Carolina blue crowd.

Davis and Bacot helped the Tar Heels to a 20-1 run that gave North Carolina an eight-point lead with just over two minutes left.

By halftime, North Caroline was up 40-31.

Michigan State trimmed the Tar Heels' lead to two in the second half as Jaden Akins scored eight points in roughly 4 ½ minutes, but North Carolina always had answers for the Spartans.

After Ingram launched a 3, the ball taunted Michigan State as it danced around the rim before sinking in. Izzo called a timeout, with the Spartans down 69-57 with 6:21 left to play.

The Spartans' body language as they headed toward the bench said it all. It was over.

After checking out for a final time, Walker bowed his head into a March Madness towel as he sat at the end of the bench before patting Hall on his back as a ""Tar Heel"" chant erupted at Spectrum Center in the final seconds of Saturday's game.

Their college careers ended with a crushing loss.

But rather than reshape the program to grow the economy, Lansing Democrats have again proposed to grow the government.

Legislation to overhaul of the state's business development and corporate incentives efforts glosses over fundamental flaws that have made the program ineffective while reinventing it to expand government through a new raft of spending that has little to do with actual job attraction.

Despite some promising measures, the legislation as passed Tuesday by the Senate would dilute the state's economic development tools and weaken its ability to compete for critical investments.

That's not a position Michigan can afford to be in, particularly as Democrats have reversed other provisions, such as right-to-work, that help attract businesses.

The 10-bill package would divert up to $250 million of the roughly $500 million a year from the Strategic Outreach and Reserve Fund (SOAR), renamed ""Make it in Michigan,"" to a new fund for subsidized community investments called Michigan 360.

The new program sounds like a big pork barrel.

Instead of site preparation, job creation or other economic catalysts that would make Michigan a more competitive place to do business, the money would go toward a wide variety of expensive new initiatives, such as child care, workforce training, high-speed internet, climate-friendly infrastructure and affordable housing, that are already elsewhere in the budget.

In addition, lawmakers could pick winners and losers based on new and subjective criteria, including a business' commitment to climate activism and support for unionization.

The diversion of funds will allow companies and communities ""to successfully grow together,"" said bill sponsor state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak, when the legislation was introduced last year.

But community development has a nebulous link to luring the kind of advanced manufacturing and knowledge-based companies Michigan needs.

Since SOAR began in 2021, the state has spent $2 billion dollars on massive incentive packages to fund jobs that pay lower than the median average and cost far more than they pay. It is difficult to predict the reliability of promised benefits and returns on investment.

Now that federal COVID money to the state has dried up, lawmakers appear eager to get their hands on any new pots of funding.

Democrats have already essentially permanently raised the income tax rate to 4.25% from 4.05% in another attempt to pay for new government programs and giveaways.

In a noteworthy critique of policy authored by her party, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she did not agree with the main Michigan 360 measure before the Democrat-controlled chamber voted on it. She should use her influence to move it in the right direction.

The program's sole focus should be providing reasonable economic to spur economic growth that fosters its own community growth and amenities.

Narrowing the criteria to only businesses that agree with Democrats on transit, affordable housing and other community priorities will disincentivize businesses from even considering Michigan to begin with.",detroitnews.com,news,The Detroit News,,0.1058823529411765,448934634,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/05/22/PDTN/bb9abd93-00c2-46ad-9732-20d8eb508601-2023-0522-dg-guns0592.jpg?auto=webp&crop=7472,4203,x0,y379&format=pjpg&width=1200",

Intriguingly, green technology might offer a single solution that addresses both of these environmental challenges in one go.

A technology company located at the Tseung Kwan O InnoPark is researching the use of recycled plastics to produce noise-absorbing meta-materials.

The firm's researchers heat and soften recycled plastics, then mould them into customised shapes to absorb sound. By stacking these acoustic meta-materials, various noise reduction products can be produced for use in applications ranging from indoor ceilings to soundproof rooms and roadside noise barriers, as well as on construction sites.

Research and development (R&D) engineer Mak Ho-yiu highlighted that the uniqueness of the materials produced lies in their structure.

""We target different acoustic problems and design different shapes to absorb sound,"" he said. ""For example, generators or industrial pumps generate low-frequency noise. Acoustic meta-materials can focus their sound absorption effects on low-frequency ranges.""

He added that materials such as metal, paper and wood can achieve the same effect, but explained that the research team had decided to use recycled plastic as their raw material of choice in order to address Hong Kong's plastic waste challenges.

Establishing operations

The two-year project has received about $3.3 million from the Green Tech Fund. The firm has hired experts in acoustic design and materials science and purchased acoustic and mechanical testing equipment.

In its first year of research work, the team established that PET, commonly found in bottles and utensils, and PVC, commonly used in construction materials, are both suitable for recycling to create acoustic meta-materials.

Company director Chen Shu-yu said the firm is now recycling plastic in the Mainland and producing products there, while its R&D work continues to be carried out in Hong Kong. The company also plans to establish a plant in Hong Kong to recycle plastics and mass-produce its noise-reduction products.

Research priorities

To lead Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality, in 2021 the Government outlined four key strategies in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050. These are focused on net-zero electricity generation; energy-saving and green buildings; green transport; and waste reduction.

To support R&D projects such as the acoustic-meta-materials one, the Government established the Green Tech Fund in 2020.

Principal Assistant Secretary for Environment & Ecology (Climate Change) Dorothy Ma said the fund gives priority to research projects that align with the action plan's decarbonisation strategies.

""These strategies aim to tackle three major sources of emissions in Hong Kong, namely electricity generation, the transport sector, and the waste sector. To address carbon emissions at the source, the Government has developed these four key carbon reduction strategies. If the funding application projects align with these strategies, they will be given priority.""

As of the end of 2023, the fund has approved 30 projects over three rounds of applications from local universities, public research institutions, and companies, awarding around $130 million in total.

The Environment & Ecology Bureau states that funded organisations are required to submit reports every six months to keep the fund updated on their progress, as well a final report upon completion for evaluation of their projects' effectiveness.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.1294117647058823,448934171,1,,

Another chain will maintain prices,"The Lidl supermarket chain announced that in April it will maintain the prices of more than 1,600 products at the current level Despite the end of the zero VAT rate on food items. The Aldi chain has also made a similar decision.

""In April, we are leaving the prices of all products subject to increases in the VAT rate to 5% at the pre-increase level,"" he wrote on Lidl's website. The network's decision includes, among others, the following: fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat and cold cuts.

Aldi announced a similar decision a few days ago. In April, the prices of products in the basic shopping cart will not be increased with VAT.

Products without increased VAT at Aldi include: M. in.: Bread, fresh meat, butter, milk, eggs, cheese, flour, bulgur, rice, oils. ""The decision not to increase VAT prices for such a wide range of products is another step in our series towards making it easier for Poles to save. This is our priority, which is why we constantly monitor the market situation and always guard good prices,"" Aldi said.

The government recently decided to stop applying VAT on food items as of April 1, which means a return to the previous rate of 5%. Rates. The zero rate has been maintained since February 2022 as one of the main elements of the so-called anti-inflation shield, which artificially lowered the consumer inflation index (CPI).

The rate returns to 5 percent. A tight budget results in: large expenses and revenues, which may be slightly less than assumed in the budget. It turns out that zero VAT is expensive for state coffers, because according to... The estimates in 2022 meant a loss of PLN 8.5 billion, and in 2023 it amounted to about PLN 11 billion.. The Ministry of Finance recently indicated that this cost will reach PLN 2.9 billion for three months of 2024. It can therefore be estimated that the remaining three quarters of this year will generate approximately PLN 9 billion in revenue for the state budget thanks to the restoration of the standard rate.

What about inflation? Economists previously estimated that - if there was no price war between discounters - the effect of returning the VAT rate to 5 percent would translate into an increase in CPI inflation of about one percentage point compared to April. (In February, inflation was 2.8% and in March it may be less than 2.5%). However, mass promotions in discount stores and recent announcements from chains such as Aldi and Lidl suggest this impact will be less.

Stray dogs are often seen dragging and gorging on these carcasses, leading to concerns about chemical contamination.

Harshavardhan Sheelavant, former syndicate member, KUD, told STOI carcasses of animals and birds used in laboratory experiments at the varsity are not being disposed of properly, violating the directives of the Committee for Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CCSEA), issued by the Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying.

""Carcasses chemically treated, laced, and tested are thrown just beside the labs, allowing stray dogs to feast on them and resulting in their death (due to infections) later on,"" he said.

A retired professor of the university, who did not wish to be named, said he had observed stray dogs consuming discarded carcasses during his morning walk.

""On several occasions, we were chased by the dogs and one person was even bitten by the strays. We had noticed a large pack of dogs at the university's zoology department,"" he added.

Anil Allolli, secretary, Green Army Dharwad, said KUD is an educational institution, and it should be a model for the society.

""Though there is a mandate to constitute an Institutional Animal Ethics Committee in the varsity to monitor the process of lab experiments using animals and birds, KUD has not had it for more than a decade,"" he said.

Prof KB Gudasi, vice-chancellor, KUD, said he was informed by the zoology department that only demonstration classes were being conducted at the MSc laboratory.

""In the research lab, there was no dissection (of animals) for the past 3-4 months. Hence, these allegations may be false,"" he added.",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,Sangamesh Menasinakai,-0.2392156862745098,448933281,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108741480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",

Put differently, 'a child is owned by all'.

Although this has been interpreted to mean that raising a child is the responsibility of all members of a community, it has also become a huge weight on the backs of African children, who feel indebted to the community which joined hands with their immediate family to raise them.

Some even go over and beyond to make sure that, in success or squalor, they provide immense support, not just to their nuclear family, but to the village.

The term, 'black tax,' originated in South Africa, denoting the financial support black professionals and higher-income individuals provide to their parents, siblings, and other family members.

A deep-seated sense of responsibility towards familial obligations often drives this financial assistance.

A family life expert and women's rights activist, Mrs Funmi Goke, noted that black tax referred to the financial responsibility placed on individuals, usually young adults, to support their extended family members, including parents, siblings, and sometimes even distant relatives.

According to her, this phenomenon is prevalent in many African countries, including Nigeria, where cultural norms emphasise communalism and collective responsibility within families and communities.

In Nigeria, black tax manifests in various ways, reflecting the socio-economic realities and cultural values of the society.

They can come in the form of financial support. Many young adults are often expected to contribute financially to their families' upkeep, including paying bills, providing for basic needs, and assisting with educational expenses.

This burden, experts have noted, may extend beyond immediate family members to include relatives such as aunts, uncles, and cousins.

Also, young people are often expected to prioritise supporting their families over pursuing their own educational and career goals, thereby sacrificing their personal dreams for their family's bigger goals.

They may forego higher education or delay entering the workforce to work and earn money to support their families' needs.

Goke identified emotional pressure alongside financial obligations as another way black tax can be seen.

She said, ""Alongside the financial obligations, individuals may also experience emotional pressure to fulfill their familial duties. They may feel a sense of guilt or obligation to support their family members, even at the expense of their well-being and aspirations.

""Nigerian culture places a strong emphasis on family and communal ties, with the expectation that individuals will support their relatives in times of need. Failure to meet these expectations may lead to social stigma or strained relationships within the family and community.""

Speaking on interdependence, Goke said, ""Black tax perpetuates a cycle of interdependence within families, where individuals rely on each other for financial support. This can create a sense of mutual obligation and solidarity but may also reinforce patterns of dependency and inhibit individual autonomy.""

Overall, for her, black tax reflects the complex interplay between sociocultural norms, economic conditions, and familial expectations in Nigeria.

While it fosters a sense of communal support and solidarity, it also poses significant challenges for young adults striving to achieve financial independence and pursue their dreams and aspirations.

Addressing the root causes of black tax requires systemic changes, including economic empowerment initiatives, social welfare programmes, and cultural shifts that prioritise individual autonomy and well-being alongside familial obligations.

The causes of black tax are multifaceted. Economic instability, inadequate social welfare systems, and cultural norms that prioritise family obligations over individual aspirations all contribute to its prevalence.

In a country where unemployment rates soar and access to quality education remains elusive for many, young Nigerians often find themselves thrust into adulthood prematurely, burdened by the weight of their family's financial struggles.

For Tolu Ogunshe, a 25-year-old banker in Lagos, navigating black tax requires resilience and resourcefulness.

She recognised that while she could not change her family's circumstances overnight, she could take proactive steps to manage her responsibilities effectively.

First and foremost, she learnt to set boundaries and communicate openly with her family members about her financial limitations. By establishing clear expectations and boundaries, she avoids feeling overwhelmed and burnt out.

Moreover, Tolu seeks opportunities for personal growth and development, knowing that investing in herself is crucial for breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty.

She pursues additional education and skills training, equipping herself with the tools needed to secure better job prospects and higher income potential. Through continuous learning and self-improvement, she expands her opportunities for financial stability and independence.

In addition to personal development, Tolu explores alternative sources of income to supplement her earnings. She harnesses the power of technology and entrepreneurship, leveraging social media platforms to market her skills and talents.

Whether it's freelance writing, graphic design, or tutoring, she discovers creative ways to generate extra income while balancing her familial responsibilities.

Furthermore, Tolu seeks out support networks and community resources to alleviate the burden of black tax. She connects with other young Nigerians facing similar challenges, sharing advice, and strategies for coping with familial expectations.

""It is really difficult for me because I am very young and my parents sometimes do not understand when I say I do not have to give. It puts me under so much pressure to always want to sacrifice my good for theirs,"" she added.

A historian and professor at the University of Texas, United States of America, Toyin Falola, in an article, ""Black Tax: Family charges and mandatory payment"", said that like the brown tax in the Latino communities, the black Tax spread across Africa as a general description of family relations for every black.

""It is seen as an obligation, and the person who sends it must do something as a necessity. Those who are the beneficiaries sometimes develop a sense of belonging and claim over the income of the individual,"" he added.

Drawing from his personal experiences and those of fellow Nigerian footballers, renowned midfielder and former Super Eagles player, Mikel Obi, vividly portrayed the considerable mental and financial strain imposed on those paying the 'black tax.'

Obi emphasised the difficulty of striking a balance between achieving one's own goals and meeting material demands, many of which are accompanied by a worrisome sense of entitlement. He stressed cases where unidentified extended family members frequently took advantage of family ties for their own self-interest and personal benefit, even threatening the 'payer' when they tried to refuse their requests.

The former Chelsea star described how some family members felt their lives were predetermined by their relationship with him, emphasising how some of them who came from large families tacitly assigned him the role of caregiver to their children.

His situation is not unlike that of French football player, Paul Pogba, whose avaricious relatives landed him in hot water with the law.

Obi said, ""You get threatened by your own blood, your own. When you come from Africa, and this is something I don't think we speak a lot about, when you make money, it's not your money.

""You have all these relatives, cousins, whatever you call it. Yeah. You know, and your sisters, they go off and they get married to some guy who just wants to get married to John Obi Mikel's family because my life is sorted. And then you start looking after this guy.

""Before you know it, you're looking at them. They keep having so many kids and so many kids, and you look at it, okay, you're having this many kids, who's going to look after them? It's you.

""For them, you owe them that. So, sometimes, you have to be strong and say, 'You know what? Guys, enough is enough; I don't care.' They give you this thing whereby, if you don't do it, we're going to go to the press. Oh, wow. After all I've done for you guys. But this happens a lot.

""In Africa, I'm telling you, not everybody comes out and speaks about it, because we're thinking, how are we going to talk about this?""

As expected, the interview generated mixed reactions from Nigerians on the Internet, with many accusing the retired star of egocentrism in the face of poverty in the country and others drumming support for him.

The discussion with Obi, according to several commentators, illuminated the larger problem of entitlement, which is the idea that one should receive benefits or special treatment not based only on merit.

If clarified, the idea of 'unmerited favour' frequently stems from a lack of empathy and a failure to recognise the work that went into obtaining the riches the recipient wishes to have in their hands.

Obi emphasised how persistent financial demands have an emotional cost and that people are reluctant to acknowledge their weakness, which feeds into the cycle of entitled behaviour.

According to a psychologist, Usen Essien, a refusal to admit when help is needed and a need to maintain one's sense of superiority can give rise to entitlement.

He added that examining hidden feelings like vulnerability and guilt might shed light on the actions linked to entitlement.

""When people take advantage of victimisation and poverty, believing that these circumstances entitle them to unjustifiable benefits, this entitlement can materialise. Societies that view poverty as a virtue are prone to this inclination, which makes victimisation desirable.

""This is demonstrated by the large number of beggars in Nigerian streets who make significant daily incomes and friends and family who feel that because they know someone, it gives them the right to collect financial help from them whenever they need it.

""Also, for any contribution made to one's finances in one's struggling period, family members and friends feel entitled to the proceeds of the success,"" he added.

However, Obi was not the first to air his view on black tax.

In 2017, a former Arsenal and Togolese striker, Emmanuel Adebayor, revealed that he was driven to suicidal thoughts because of how his family attempted to ""manipulate money out of him"".

""I felt like killing myself so many times. I kept this to myself for years and years. I am disgusted that things reached this stage, but I feel relieved to have talked about it"".

Another footballer, Victor Osimhen, who plays for Napoli football club and the Super Eagles, was in the news for a similar situation with his brother-in-law.

Though Osimhen has not opened up to the media about what happened, it would not be bad to assume that many African football icons may be going through serious bullying and other manipulations from their families and friends which should be condemned entirely.

An author and social commentator, Cheta Nwanze, lending his voice, noted that entitlement often manifested when a dedication to consumption exceeded one's capacity for productivity.

He said, ""The imbalance between virtuous restraint and pronounced greed can lead to a tipping point. The persistence of this behaviour, regardless of its origin, is driven by the anticipation of some form of reward, making negative reinforcement a potential means for behavioural change.

""Usually, individuals may lack awareness of the emotional toll associated with giving, mainly when results are not evident. Thus, cultures that fail to cultivate empathy tend to experience higher incidences of entitled behaviour.

""While acknowledging the negative aspects of entitlement, it is imperative to approach the discourse on black tax with nuance and balance. One must consider instances where poor people have been helped to access lifesaving or life-changing resources such as education, healthcare, housing, or trade funding.""

According to him, there have been notable instances of positive outcomes resulting from black tax, indicating that the concept should not be dismissed outright.

He added that black tax extended beyond the exchange of money, adding that it also involved the transfer of intangible resources such as skills and insights derived from successful professional and financial experiences.

""A good example in this context is the American billionaire, Robert F. Smith. He has generously contributed a substantial portion of his estimated $4.4bn fortune to his community, including $34m for student loan debt forgiveness.

""Many beneficiaries of his generosity have achieved remarkable feats, partly attributed to the alleviation of financial burdens he provided.

""In Nigeria's context, the prevalence of black tax reflects a distorted social contract, where responsibilities traditionally assigned to impersonal institutions, such as the government, are shifted onto individuals who cannot bear such responsibilities sustainably,"" he said.

""A significant portion of the country can trace more of its success to the input of kinsmen than to any direct input from formal governance structures, which might be a foundational element of the problem.

""This distorted social contract places an undue burden of governance on the helper, affording them some level of authority over the group. This deviates from the conventional principles of a fair social contract, wherein the government is designated the responsibility and authority over resources, decision-making, violence, and other pertinent aspects.

""The inclination to rely on personal relationships instead of institutional structures hampers the adoption of a more structured and practical approach to social welfare and governance,"" he added.

For a sociologist, Fortune Obi, putting the onus of ensuring well-being on individuals may turn attention away from broad ideals and toward the whims of particular individuals.

He added, ""People who believe that they only have social contracts with their kinsmen are more likely to fight to have resources placed at their kinsmen's disposal rather than a government, which is one of the reasons our politics are often polluted by tribalism.

""This phenomenon is the outcome of an unsuccessful shift from the monarchist to the contemporary nation-state era. Because solid institutions were not established throughout this transition, a system of disproportionate influence on individuals rather than ideals has persisted.""

Also speaking on the matter, Prof Falola averred that the African social system was unarguably built on the premises and strength of family and responsibilities.

""Society is built on collective responsibilities that spread even to every member of society at large as a unit. This is why persons from the same village, like Umuahia, would always refer to their kinsmen as brothers or sisters merely because they have come from the same village or area.

""It is the sense of responsibility that bonds the African society that has been spelt out so eminently. But the question in this piece is not about the collective nature of the African communities but the responsibilities that follow from the family relationships, either for those within the same blood or the 'village family.' The issue is of 'black' tax; black here is not a racialised category.""

He further added that the modern exposure had allowed questions raised on whether the cultures were of necessity or mere subjections that had resulted in the slow pace of individual developments or castigated some Africans' invisible slavery.

The historian added, ""When there is just one successful person in an extended family, the act of giving moves from mere social responsibilities to social burdens.

""We must understand that new cultures and the contemporarily subscribed behaviours born out of overbearing cultural diffusions gotten from excessive universalism have been gradually killing the bonds that the African societies have for each other. It has increased selfishness and made the act of philanthropism, which was initially a social necessity, become out of the ordinary.",punchng.com,news,Punch Newspapers,Godfrey George,0.1529411764705881,448932476,1,https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23224807/BLACK-TAX.jpg,

No one has ever doubted Hubert Davis's passion, and as the Tar Heels found themselves down by 12 points early to the Michigan State Spartans in the Round of 32, his passion ignited with his team and then it carried over to his sideline interview with CBS Reporter Allie LaForce.

When questioned about the Spartans' wiling themselves into the paint, Davis demonstratively stated what his team needed to do.

""They were catching the ball right under the basket,"" Davis exlaimed. ""Until we meet the fight, then that's when things will turn around""

Well, meet the fight they did and turn things around they did. The Tar Heels went on a 23-3 run in the final eight minutes of the half to take a 40-31 lead going into the second half.

Artificial Intelligence is all over the news. Not long ago, Nvidia -- a leader in artificial intelligence -- surpassed Amazon's stock value, indicating a surge in demand. In many cases, AI is creating positive effects by doing things like helping to automate tasks and power research at a much faster rate. However, one concerning outcome of AI and machine learning is the unregulated development and dissemination of ""deepfake"" content.

What are deepfakes and why they are problematic

Deepfakes are created by individuals or organizations using AI algorithms to manipulate data such as images, videos, and audio recordings of a person or people. In some cases, AI is used to create helpful resources like professional headshots, but the darker side of AI revolves around malice and misinformation, where altered media is used to intimidate or harass the subject or spread lies.

X, formerly known as Twitter, briefly stopped searches of Taylor Swift after deepfake pornographic images of the singer started circulating on the internet. With the looming election, deepfakes of politicians are popping up all over the place, prompting lawmakers to regulate the phenomenon. In one case, a deepfake voice recording of Joe Biden was used to discourage Democrats from participating in the primary election, which could have swayed voting results. With outcomes like that, it's easy to question whether AI is doing more harm than good.

Dr. Federica Fornaciari, an associate professor in the Strategic Communications programs at the National University, shared her thoughts on this type of technology: "" ... It is pretty astonishing to witness how realistic these deepfakes can be, especially in a technology [sic] evolves at an incredible speed but obviously also raises critical concerns ... They've become a hotbed for ethical and societal discussion. You know, from tarnishing the reputation of public figures to spreading misinformation, they can cause pretty significant challenges for media integrity and for public trust ultimately."" The creation of deepfakes is concerning not only because of the speed of its development but also because of its unchecked regulation.

Dr. Siwei Lyu, a SUNY Empire Innovation professor of computer science and engineering with the University of Buffalo told Yellow Scene Magazine that one of his greatest concerns is that ""DeepFakes can escalate the scale and danger of online fraud and disinformation when used for deception to threaten our cognitive security. Similar to threats to our physical security or cybersecurity, which aims to break into our physical infrastructure or cyber systems, threats to cognitive security target our perceptual system and decision-making process. In particular, by creating illusions of an individual's presence and activities that did not occur in reality, DeepFakes can influence our opinions or decisions."" Although deepfakes haven't yet induced identifiable long-term change, they often create short-term chaos that can lead to disruptions and an erosion in trust in digital media, Dr. Lyu said.

Many of the problems deepfakes present are probably going to grow. ""We will likely reach a tipping point where the production of fake content outpaces our ability to detect it. This could have several implications. With this advancement, we anticipate an increase in the volume and quality of fake content on social media and the internet. The speed of generation and distribution of this content may accelerate, potentially flooding our information ecosystem. Furthermore, we might see more comprehensive disinformation campaigns that combine multimedia and multi-site illusions. Deceptive narratives could be reinforced across texts, images, videos, and audio for more compelling storytelling. Additionally, we can expect more refined and subtle forms of manipulation targeting individuals, businesses, and government agencies,"" said Dr. Lyu. Even if deepfake technology can be regulated, it will likely happen at a slower rate than the development of the technology.

With the potential growth of problems surrounding the volume of deepfake content, the speed of use, and the rise of disinformation, the technology has the potential to disrupt social platforms in a harmful way.

Why deepfake technology is useful

The development of a deepfake relies on deep learning, where an algorithm receives numerous examples which are then used to create similar images or footage. The algorithm works with an opposing algorithm to improve the final rendering. In some cases, the results can be concerning or damaging. However, the same technology that is being used to generate deepfakes can also accomplish tasks like animating historical photographs, repairing old video, or creating footage that can be used for educational purposes.

In one scenario, the Malaria Must Die campaign used deepfake technology to create a video featuring David Beckham speaking in nine different languages, encouraging viewers to petition to end malaria. This application demonstrates the potential to leverage deepfake technology for positive purposes.

While the rise of deepfake content comes with an uproar of ethical and social concerns, the technology that it uses is revolutionary. According to Dr. Lyu, ""The generative AI technology behind the production of DeepfFakes has many beneficial uses. Examples include immersive communication ... and faster video streaming ... reducing cost and effort in the movie and advertisement industry, and rehabilitation efforts for stroke patients and individuals with hearing impairment.""

The legality surrounding deepfake creation and distribution

The creation and use of most deepfakes is not currently illegal across the United States, but state laws vary. The state of Minnesota recently made it illegal to create and distribute deepfakes in cases where political ramifications and pornography creation are in question. Additionally, Georgia, Hawaii, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming have laws in place that regulate these fake videos and images.

However, lawmakers are beginning to evaluate whether or not there should be some restrictions surrounding these images and videos, particularly when it comes to nonconsensual porn. Most recently, a bipartisan bill was introduced that would allow victims to sue those who create deepfakes, knowing that there was no consent in their making. The bill came shortly after deepfakes of Taylor Swift were distributed across the internet. At this time, ten states already have laws in place that create this type of protection. The new bill would create federal protections.

Who suffers the most from deepfake usage?

One of the greatest concerns surrounding deepfake usage is how and who it may impact. While no one is immune to the use of deepfakes, this type of technology has the potential to perpetuate stereotypes and incriminate marginalized communities.

Dr. Fornaciari stated, ""Marginalized communities are particularly at risk. You know, deepfakes can exacerbate existing inequalities, they can target those who are already disproportionately disadvantaged. Manipulated content can, you know, amplify hate speech. It can fuel discrimination, it can perpetuate false narratives and further make it even more problematic for social progress to happen. Right, so we've seen the consequences of deepfakes in so many domains. In humanitarian crises or emergency situations, deepfakes can hinder relief efforts. They can exacerbate confusion. Humanitarian aid workers and those who are affected by the crisis could encounter challenges in delivering and receiving accurate information. It is scary, you know.""

The side effects of using deepfakes to create false narratives could be catastrophic for some parties. ""These are all troubling concerns, you know, deepfakes can so easily be exploited to target and harm different communities, different individuals. Again, particularly public figures but also vulnerable communities. So there are very serious consequences for the individual and for society. So media authenticity is at stake. Consumers who rely on accurate information, and incredible sources to make their informed decisions, can encounter problems there. Of course, reputation and identity can be at stake. You know, when deepfakes portray someone engaging in actions or they never did, these manipulations can have far-reaching personal and professional consequences,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

Dr. Lyu agreed that deepfakes can be dangerous and that no one is safe from their impacts. ""Deepfake attacks can target anyone. The particularly vulnerable demographics include older adults, to whom DeepFake audios can often be exploited for financial scams targeting them (e.g., grandparent scams). Women and girls are also victims of defamation attacks using DeepFakes, e.g., revenge pornography."" In most American states, the legal parameters for deepfake use have not yet been established, which makes it difficult to protect against exploitation.

The era of fake news and compromised media trust

The spread of ""fake news"" isn't anything new. Some estimates suggest that the spread of disinformation has been happening for centuries, although the term for it wasn't established until the 1890s. As technology evolves, however, fake news seems to be getting more and more convincing, and deepfakes are a great example of the harm that it can cause. As this type of tool becomes more wide-spread, so is the general mistrust of the media.

Dr. Fornaciari reflected, ""One primary concern for sure revolves around the potential for misinformation and deception. As we have said, deepfakes can pretty convincingly fabricate content. They blur the line between reality and unreality. So media consumers need to exercise caution in trusting sources. They need to develop critical thinking skills. They need to verify the authenticity of the content that they encounter and they share because there is another component here to remember."" Now more than ever, being able to verify that a media source is trustworthy and likely to convey accurate information is vital. While regulation is part of the equation when it comes to deepfakes, so is personal responsibility. Learning how to detect deepfakes can slow or stop the progress of disinformation.

Distinguishing deepfakes from real images and videos

Artificial intelligence has a shocking ability to fabricate content, which can make it difficult to determine what virtual information is trustworthy. As AI advances, the images and videos that it creates will likely be harder to evaluate for misinformation.

Dr. Fornaciari said, ""... Distinguishing authentic content, genuine content, from manipulated content becomes increasingly challenging, and this goes without saying, it can lead to skepticism or people question whether you know every piece of media they encounter is authentic or fabricated. So society may witness a pretty concerning decline in the credibility of video evidence, which can have consequences, you know, in the legal context, or they can create obstacles in determining the truth, hindering the pursuit of justice."" While historically, videos have been used as evidence in court, it is likely that the rise of deepfakes could impact this type of evidence in the future.

Fortunately, as deepfakes become popular, some industry professionals are researching ways to monitor it. Dr. Lyu reflected, ""We developed DeepFake detection methods for two primary purposes: triage and evidence. A DeepFake detector used for triage screens out a smaller subset of likely DeepFakes from a large number of images, audio, and videos for closer scrutiny. For triage detectors, the primary metric is detection accuracy, minimal human intervention, and run-time efficiency. As such, they are often implemented with data-driven, AI-based methods, directly employing machine learning models trained on real media and DeepFakes to classify them."" Being able to detect and evaluate deepfakes is a vital piece of the equation when it comes to the management of them.

As artificial intelligence progresses and continues to learn, it's likely that deepfakes will become more difficult to detect. However, there are some clues that currently allow individuals to recognize them. According to MIT, individuals who scour the internet might also look for clues like facial abnormalities, especially to the cheeks, forehead, skin, and eyes. One might also evaluate an individual's glasses for glare, facial hair, and moles. In videos, blinking and lip movements can also provide clues as to whether or not it is a deepfake.

Future management of deepfakes

When it comes to the future of deepfake management, the path isn't entirely clear. However, most experts agree that regulators need to come up with some type of management plan. ""That's something that we all need to work on, like policymakers, the legal systems, the individuals, the, you know, educators everyone should be involved. The technology companies, every. Everyone needs to work together to make sure that deepfakes are you know, that this technology is used in ethical ways, that this technology fulfills a need rather than create a problem,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

However, it isn't entirely surprising to find that the technology is making leaps and bounds faster than it can be regulated. ""Technology is always evolving faster than the legal system and the regulation, so it can be a little difficult for the legal system to keep up. But governments could explore policies that require explicit disclosure of deepfake content, for instance, and penalties for those who create and disseminate malicious deepfakes with harmful intent. But again, it's a very fine line. It's complicated to be able to create regulations that don't hinder the creation while protecting the possible harm,"" she added. While it's clear that some amount of regulation could be beneficial in the management of deepfakes, too much regulation could stunt technological advancements.

The malicious intent that often comes with the development of deepfakes is the issue that most needs to be targeted. ""Again, you know, fighting the spread of malicious deepfake content to make sure that the integrity of the media is preserved is a critical challenge, and it requires a multifaceted approach, for sure,"" said Dr. Fornaciari.

Dr. Lyu's perspective surrounding deepfake management involves some level of restriction as well: ""... The current policies and regulations need to be more precise in delineating innocent and malicious use of synthetic media as the generative AI technology and synthetic media are dual-used, unless in extreme cases of misuse (e.g., generating targeted pornography videos to defame an individual), banning or restricting the technology may lead to unwanted side effects.""

Dr. Fornaciari suggests ways forward: ""... Raising awareness, promoting media literacy, is crucial.

The I-T searches had started at 7 am on Wednesday.

While leaving, the officers were seen with the same blue trolley bag they had entered with. Sources said Swarup has been asked to meet I-T officials with detailed statements of all his bank transactions and income details by the first week of April.

Swarup, who spoke to reporters immediately after the raids were completed, said: ""It is apparent that this is politically motivated. Those of us who are with Trinamool are being individually targeted, to politically weaken us. We are with TMC and our leader is Mamata Banerjee. Even if they behead us, that name will never change. Do not know what the investigation was about... no cash seized, no ornaments seized, no papers seized. They asked about financial matters.""

The I-T department, which conducted simultaneous searches at more than 20 locations, including the Biswas apartment at Sahapur Colony, has seized unaccounted cash worth Rs 50 lakh. While it did not give any statement regarding the searches, sources said apart from cash, financial documents were also seized.

The income tax department, however, did not share any details on the outcome of the raid specific to Biswas's home. Officials only hinted that they were probing unaccounted financial transactions by Swarup with two realtors.

Jui said: ""I have one bank account and I gave the details. This is an old account and even before joining politics this was my salary account. Things (in this account) are clear as water. This (the probe) could have been completed in one day. Whatever their queries were had been completed in one day. They were unable to wind up early... they admitted this.

The Marble Freedom Trust, a nonprofit for which Leo acts as chairman, has found itself under the microscope of media outlets and Democratic politicians such as Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse due to Leo's involvement in the conservative judicial sphere.

During its 2022 fiscal year, the group gave large sums of money to three other entities.

""Liberals, led by over $1 billion a year from the foreign-funded Arabella Advisors network, have dominated dark money in politics,"" a Marble Freedom Trust spokesperson told Fox News Digital.""In the face of such lopsided spending, Marble Freedom Trust is working to even the playing field so that conservatives can crush liberal dominance.""

FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT CHALLENGING DC NONCITIZEN VOTING LAW

According to the Marble Freedom Trust's newest tax forms, Leo's group disbursed $216.8 million between May 2022 and May 2023, an increase of $34.1 million over the previous year, when it handed out $182 million in donations.

The new tax documents show the nonprofit pushed a bulk of this cash -- $153.7 million -- to the Schwab Charitable Fund, a donor-advised fund used by groups and individuals to make other charitable contributions.

The New York Times previously reported that the Schwab Charitable Fund gave $141.5 million to the 85 Fund, another group linked to Leo, before the period laid out in the most recent tax forms.

During its most recent fiscal year, the Marble Freedom Trust also provided $55.5 million to the Concord Fund, which previously was known as the Judicial Crisis Network and also has been tied to Leo.

Its last donation -- in the amount of $7.6 million -- went to the Knights of Columbus Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.

Once an organization or individual pushes money to entities such as the Schwab Charitable Fund and Knights of Columbus Charitable Fund, it is practically impossible to trace where the money ends up.

Leo has been the target of Democratic lawmakers over his involvement in right-leaning judicial matters as part of their investigation into Supreme Court justices.

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats Dick Durbin of Illinois and Whitehouse have sent letters to Leo and billionaire activists seeking information regarding trips and events Supreme Court justices have taken and participated in over the years.

In October, the senators sent a letter to Leo, Harlan Crow and Robin Arkley in an attempt to strong-arm them into complying with a previous July request for details about trips involving justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

Leo, however, rejected their demands in a letter his attorneys sent to committee Chairman Durbin, a copy of which Fox News Digital previously obtained.

""We have put forward clear and detailed reasons why the Committee's inquiry is a form of political retaliation in violation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause,"" Leo's attorney, David Rivkin, wrote in the letter.

""But, for the most part, the October 5 Letter ignores these points, and, since our last correspondence, the Committee has only expanded the retaliatory campaign it is mounting against Mr. Leo.""

For decades, Leo has been a part of the Federalist Society, which progressive activists have long criticized for its involvement in helping advise and lobby former President Trump through the nominations of Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

Leo has also been a target of Washington, D.C.'s Democratic Atorney General Brian Schwalb, who launched an investigation into Leo's network last summer.

The government this week released its response to a parliamentary inquiry that urged the state to investigate options to scrap stamp duty and replace it with a broad-based land tax.

The government said it accepted the report's recommendations in part or in principle.

In its response, the government said it ""considers Victoria's taxation mix to balance many priorities and looks for opportunities for reform where possible"", and has already announced ""a transition away from stamp duty to a Commercial and Industrial Property Tax for commercial and industrial properties"".

We break down what the possible changes could mean for homebuyers.

What is the difference between upfront stamp duty and having it paid via an annual tax?

Stamp duty is a tax charged by state and territory governments on property purchases, paid at the time of buying.

An annual property tax allows homebuyers to opt to pay an a yearly amount, based on a percentage of the value of the land the property sits on, thereby spreading the cost across many years.

What are the benefits and pitfalls of stamp duty?

Stamp duty is one of the biggest upfront costs to buying a home and a major barrier for first home buyers.

Brendan Coates, the economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, says Victorians spend ""six months of the average annual wage"" to pay for stamp duty.

""That makes the deposit hurdle even harder when it's already often taking 10 years for people to save for a deposit,"" he says.

Coates says stamp duty also disincentives homeowners to upgrade to a bigger house for a growing family, downsizing later in life, or moving for a new job.

He says abolishing stamp duty in favour of an annual tax will make housing cheaper. ""If you better use the housing stock, then that frees up homes for people that need them,"" he says.

John Freebairn, an emeritus professor of economics at the University of Melbourne, says property investors would also benefit from abolishing stamp duty because that cohort tends to buy and sell more often than owner-occupiers.

""Some landlords might also pass these lower taxes on to renters,"" he says.

Coates says replacing stamp duty with a land tax could increase home ownership by more than 6%.

But removing upfront stamp duty would have a financial impact on Victoria's already-stretched budget, with the state's net debt forecast to reach more than $177bn by June 2027.

The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, had previously warned the state budget's bottom line would take a $30bn hit if stamp duty was scrapped.

But Coates' analysis has estimated the state's economy would be $5.3bn better off in the next financial year if stamp duty was replaced with an annual land tax.

What are the benefits and pitfalls of an annual tax?

Coates says a land tax is ""about the best tax you can have"".

""It doesn't distort people's choices, because it applies regardless of what they do with the land,"" he says.

He says transitioning to a land tax is challenging, because of the financial hit to people who have recently paid stamp duty and the need to manage the impact on pensioners who are on low incomes.

Coates says the federal government could cover some of the transition costs that come from a reduction in revenue in the short-term.

""They should do it because you get a bigger economy as a result of these reforms. So the federal government collects tax revenue in Australia so they'll be the main beneficiaries of something the state government does,"" he says.

Under the former coalition government in New South Wales, first home buyers had the option to pay an annual property tax bill for properties worth up to $1.5m. The government at the time said stamp duty adds two years to the time required to save for a home deposit for NSW households.

The reform was scrapped by the current Labor government that instead opted to waive stamp duty for first home buyers on purchases up to $800,000 - lifting the threshold from $650,000. The Minns government also introduced a reduce rate for homes up to $1m.

In 2012, the ACT began phasing out stamp duty, while raising council rates to phase in a broad-based land tax on homeowners. The territory also offers a homebuyer concession scheme which was expanded last year.

Freebairn says the ACT's model of phasing out stamp duty could be adopted by Victoria.

""Its positives are [that] it's revenue-neutral for the government but it takes a long time to get rid of stamp duty and its problems,"" he says.

What else is Victoria doing?

The Allan government this week introduced a bill to abolish stamp duty for commercial and industrial properties and replaced it with a broad-based land tax. The reform, which comes into effect from July, means buyers will have the option to make a one-time stamp duty payment or pay it annually over a decade, with interest. After the 10-year period, a tax will apply at the rate of 1% of the property's unimproved land value.

Coates says this model could be applied to residential properties.

Looking to minimise noise pollution? Perhaps green technology could be a solution to tackle two environmental challenges in one go. At Tseung Kwan O InnoPark, this technology company is researching the use of recycled plastics to produce noise-absorbing meta-materials. First, the recycled plastics are heated and softened, then they are moulded into customised shapes to absorb sound. By stacking these acoustic meta-materials, noises can be blocked out. Technology company director Chen Shu-yu: We (have) also tested metal, ceramic (and) even paper-based materials. They all work the same way (as far as) acoustic properties (are concerned). In this way, we (thought) why not use recycled plastics as raw materials? By design, we can actually control the shape of the absorption spectrum. That will give you the ability to tackle specific noise features from, for example, machinery noise, that will have low-frequency features. Voiceover: This project has received about $3.3 million from the Green Tech Fund, enabling the company to hire professionals and acquire necessary equipment. After about one year of research and development, the team thinks that PET, commonly found in bottles and utensils, and PVC, commonly used in construction materials, are both suitable for recycling to create acoustic meta-materials. These materials can be used in environments such as construction sites, or for roadsides noise barriers. The company plans to establish a plant in Hong Kong to recycle plastics and mass-produce its noise-reduction products. The Government established the Green Tech Fund, to support R&D projects such as this one, in 2020. Its four research priorities align with the Government's strategies to achieve carbon neutrality. Principal Assistant Secretary for Environment & Ecology (Climate Change) : The major strategies include net zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. These strategies aim to tackle three major sources of emissions in Hong Kong, namely electricity generation, the transport sector, and lastly the waste sector. Voiceover: As of the end of 2023, the fund has approved 30 projects over three rounds of applications from local universities, public research institutions, and businesses, awarding around $130 million in total. Project leaders are required to submit progress reports regularly to keep the fund updated on how their research is advancing.

Plastic waste is the second largest source of municipal solid waste in Hong Kong, while noise pollution from sources such as construction and road traffic is also a concern for many in the city. Intriguingly, green technology might offer a single solution that addresses both of these environmental challenges in one go.

A technology company located at the Tseung Kwan O InnoPark is researching the use of recycled plastics to produce noise-absorbing meta-materials.

The firm's researchers heat and soften recycled plastics, then mould them into customised shapes to absorb sound. By stacking these acoustic meta-materials, various noise reduction products can be produced for use in applications ranging from indoor ceilings to soundproof rooms and roadside noise barriers, as well as on construction sites.

Research and development (R&D) engineer Mak Ho-yiu highlighted that the uniqueness of the materials produced lies in their structure.

""We target different acoustic problems and design different shapes to absorb sound,"" he said. ""For example, generators or industrial pumps generate low-frequency noise. Acoustic meta-materials can focus their sound absorption effects on low-frequency ranges.""

He added that materials such as metal, paper and wood can achieve the same effect, but explained that the research team had decided to use recycled plastic as their raw material of choice in order to address Hong Kong's plastic waste challenges.

The two-year project has received about $3.3 million from the Green Tech Fund. The firm has hired experts in acoustic design and materials science and purchased acoustic and mechanical testing equipment.

In its first year of research work, the team established that PET, commonly found in bottles and utensils, and PVC, commonly used in construction materials, are both suitable for recycling to create acoustic meta-materials.

Company director Chen Shu-yu said the firm is now recycling plastic in the Mainland and producing products there, while its R&D work continues to be carried out in Hong Kong. The company also plans to establish a plant in Hong Kong to recycle plastics and mass-produce its noise-reduction products.

To lead Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality, in 2021 the Government outlined four key strategies in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050. These are focused on net-zero electricity generation; energy-saving and green buildings; green transport; and waste reduction.

To support R&D projects such as the acoustic-meta-materials one, the Government established the Green Tech Fund in 2020.

Principal Assistant Secretary for Environment & Ecology (Climate Change) Dorothy Ma said the fund gives priority to research projects that align with the action plan's decarbonisation strategies.

""These strategies aim to tackle three major sources of emissions in Hong Kong, namely electricity generation, the transport sector, and the waste sector. To address carbon emissions at the source, the Government has developed these four key carbon reduction strategies. If the funding application projects align with these strategies, they will be given priority.""

Freebairn says the ACT's model of phasing out stamp duty could be adopted by Victoria.

""Its positives are [that] it's revenue-neutral for the government but it takes a long time to get rid of stamp duty and its problems,"" he says.

The Allan government this week introduced a bill to abolish stamp duty for commercial and industrial properties and replaced it with a broad-based land tax. The reform, which comes into effect from July, means buyers will have the option to make a one-time stamp duty payment or pay it annually over a decade, with interest. After the 10-year period, a tax will apply at the rate of 1% of the property's unimproved land value.

Coates says this model could be applied to residential properties.

The European Union Parliament has taken a significant step by outlawing unidentified self-custody crypto wallets for making payments across the region.

A recent social media post by Patrick Breyer, an EU Parliament member, revealed that the ban received approval from most of the parliament's leadership committee on March 19. This move is part of the EU's broader anti-money laundering (AML) legislation.

The new regulations ban all anonymous crypto payments and cash transactions above certain limits. Specifically, they prohibit cash payments exceeding €10,000 or anonymous cash transactions beyond €3,000. The ban also targets self-custody wallets on mobile, desktop, or browser applications.

Although the law is slated to take effect in three years, there are suggestions that its implementation might be sooner.

Nonetheless, the new regulation is set to reshape how Europeans engage with digital currencies. It has also triggered apprehensions regarding user privacy and financial inclusivity due to its stringent stance against anonymity. Additionally, the regulation could pose significant barriers to innovation and impede widespread crypto adoption in the region.

Breyer, a dissenting voice within the parliament, argued that the ban could impact law-abiding citizens rather than curbing criminal activities. He emphasized that anonymous payments have served legitimate purposes.

He cited examples such as donations to individuals like Alexei Navalny and organizations like WikiLeaks. Moreover, he highlighted the importance of financial privacy for personal transactions.

Breyer also expressed concerns that heightened surveillance of financial transactions could inadvertently facilitate malicious activities by hackers and encroach on individual freedoms.

""We need to find ways to bring the best features of cash into our digital future. We also have the right to be able to pay and donate in cryptocurrencies online without our payment behavior being recorded for no reason and personally. If the EU believes it can regulate virtual currencies on its own, it has not understood the global internet,"" Breyer said.

Similarly, crypto community members have raised questions and concerns regarding the scope of the ban on anonymous payments. One user, in particular, sought clarification on whether the ban would extend to all cryptocurrencies or only those categorized as privacy coins.

Notably, several crypto exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have delisted several privacy-focused tokens for their users in Europe.

The first apartment building in the dense, large-scale Timber Yards development, which will be called Everpine, received a nearly $8.4 million, 10-year property tax break from the Bend City Council on Wednesday.

The tax break is for a six-story, 246-unit apartment complex with ground floor retail and restaurant space and a public plaza, all located in what is set to become Bend's densest development to date.

In a 6-1 vote, councilors approved the tax break, which was made possible through the city's multi-unit property tax exemption program.

The program was put on pause in February after public outcry over a roughly $10 million tax break for an in-progress development. But Timber Yard developer Kennedy Wilson, a Beverly Hills-based global real estate investment firm, submitted an application through the city's program before the pause.

Kennedy Wilson purchased the property in 2021 in a $40 million sale, according to Deschutes County property records. The Day family, who also owns the local construction company Hooker Creek, are still part owners of the property.

""The development -- the assets that will eventually be built here -- are long term assets. We're going to hold them. We're not merchant developers. We don't build and flip, essentially,"" Keith Herren with Kennedy Wilson, said at Wednesday's City Council meeting.

The tax exemption program offers 10-year tax breaks for housing developments that wouldn't normally be built. Properties also must be located in certain areas of the city and must offer added public benefits. The program was created in 2022, as allowed by statewide legislation, but the city tailored it to fit Bend's needs.

The multi-unit property tax exemption program will be reevaluated at a public meeting in May.

In the case of Everpine, it's located in Bend's Core Area, an urban renewal district. Developers promised the public benefits of a public plaza, which qualifies as 10% of the lot dedicated to open space, added landscaping with native and pollinator-friendly plants and a parking structure mostly hidden from street view within the building.

A third-party financial analysis found the project isn't financially feasible without the property tax exemption. With the exemption, the developer's return on investment jumped from 5.3% to about 6%, which Allison Platt, the city's core area project manager, classified as still pretty low.

The $8.37 million break is not money that's taken from any of the area's taxing districts or urban renewal agency's existing revenue streams, Platt said at the meeting.

""These are revenues that are only generated if this project were to move forward,"" she said. ""It's essentially the project helping pay for itself.""

Everpine, where rent for a one bedroom is estimated at around $2,100, is the first of many phases of development for the 21-acre Timber Yards development over the next 10 years.

Councilors were mostly supportive. Many cited new housing, regardless of its level of affordability, as a positive solution to the local housing crisis, especially since it doesn't displace existing residents. Councilor Mike Riley voted against, saying Everpine doesn't address the acute housing needs of Bend.

We have a proud history of assisting Virginia veterans and sponsoring numerous programs that serve our country and its citizens. AMVETS Department of Virginia exists to serve the veterans of America's armed forces who live and work in Virginia through the services rendered at both our state level and on the local level through our AMVETS posts.

One of the ways AMVETS raises funds to serve Virginia veterans and their communities is through Virginia's charitable gaming regulatory framework, which is regulated by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

A disastrous bill for Virginia's veterans is currently on Gov. Glenn Youngkin's desk: Senate Bill 212, which would legalize tens of thousands of ""skill game"" slot machines in public places. The ramifications of legalization will cause severe harm to our fundraising efforts to support veterans in need. Legalizing these machines in every local convenience store and gas station will hurt other forms of authorized and legal gaming and will hurt revenue to the Virginia Lottery and veterans' service organizations and other charitable organizations particularly hard.

For seven of the last eight years, companies manufacturing and distributing these so-called ""skill"" slot machines operated in Virginia in bad faith, without authorization from the General Assembly or regulation by the state government. For years, tens of thousands of skill slot machines operated in public places with a total lack of accountability for the game operators.

Since we couldn't trust them to follow the law then, we can't trust them now. It is imperative that Youngkin veto SB212 and any other bill legalizing these games so that untrustworthy skill gaming machines do not infiltrate our communities.

Virginians already have plenty of legal opportunities to gamble at casinos, horse racing venues, the lottery and sports betting. We don't need an industry with a record of going outside the law and exploiting Virginians with odds stacked against the player with the promise of prizes while having no guarantee of a fair payout.

In addition to harming legal gaming, tens of thousands of skill gambling machines everywhere in Virginia will especially harm income to churches, community groups and veterans service organizations.

Even more concerning is that the proliferation of skill game machines will undoubtedly create large scale criminal activity in Virginia communities. Speak with law enforcement officers and they will tell you that anytime there is a large amount of loose cash in a public place, that location quickly becomes a prime target for crime and money laundering. The presence of these machines at convenience stores and gas stations will increase loitering, which further increases the potential for crime in local neighborhoods. SB212 does not require establishments hosting these machines to have adequate security measures.

The General Assembly banned these machines in 2020 and 2022, so it has been disheartening to see legislation recently pass (barely) the Virginia General Assembly. After seeing that vote, I refuse to stand by and watch such a harmful bill pass without speaking up.

If Youngkin signs SB212, it will open the floodgates for tens of thousands of these machines to pop up in every local neighborhood in Virginia -- increasing crime, gambling by minors and harming income to charitable organizations.

I urge the governor to consider the far-reaching consequences of SB212 and veto it outright. By vetoing this bill, he can send a clear message that Virginia stands firmly for protecting Virginia's veterans, families and communities. A Youngkin veto will also send the message that Virginia stands for the rule of law and if bad actors operate unauthorized in the commonwealth of Virginia, they will not be rewarded.",pilotonline.com,news,The Virginian Pilot,,0.06666666666666665,448928741,1,https://www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2JFHWGEO6RAEFAXRAQCQLVU3IQ.jpg?w=640,

Atmo AI has signed a contract with the Philippines' national meteorological agency PAGASA - the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration - to complement the country's existing weather forecasting with a machine learning approach.

The promise is faster autonomous forecasts with greater accuracy - potentially a major boon for the agency, considering the Philippines' geographical reality.

The country is the most typhoon-prone on the planet, enduring about a quarter of the global tally every year. And because of climate change, the storms are expected to hit harder and move along paths that are difficult to predict and prepare for.

""The question that we set out to ask was, could we take everything that's been learnt in AI and physics, bring it over to atmospheric science and turn up the accuracy, turn up the detail and crank down the cost?"" Mr Levy said.

""What if you could give the Philippines better forecasts than America? That was it.""

Instead of solely relying on expensive supercomputers and satellites monopolised by advanced economies like the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, the Philippines will now be armed with its own customised AI tool, which runs on a subscription model with Atmo.

Typical existing weather forecasting worldwide has not changed for about 70 years. While improvements have slowly been made, the tools are fundamentally similar - essentially using mathematics and current conditions to predict the future.

According to Mr Levy, this has left many countries with substandard weather forecasting.

""What you've seen is a lot of these global models have gotten progressively better at a slow rate for the area that sponsors them, but are actually very poor in the tropics and subtropical regions,"" he said.

That could soon change, from large urban centres like Manila to rural provinces where understanding the weather is important for agriculture. The detail in forecasting could be enhanced by 100 times, Mr Levy said.

""The previous gold standard forecasts would have treated the whole city (of Manila) as four zones. We treat it as 10,000 zones. It's going to be like putting on glasses,"" he said.

""The moment that water from Angat River is already appropriated and impounded into the Angat Dam, it ceases to form part of natural resource,"" the high tribunal said in a decision penned by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul Inting.

The Supreme Court effectively granted the MWSS petition for review on certiorari as it reversed and set aside the 2008 decision of the appellate court in favor of Bulacan province.

The case stemmed from the complaint for specific performance/payment of national wealth share against MWSS filed by the provincial government of Bulacan through then Gov. Josefina Dela Cruz.

The Bulacan government said MWSS had been getting proceeds from the water resource of Angat Dam, which is located within its territorial jurisdiction.

It claimed MWSS must pay the local government a share of the utilization and development of national wealth.

However, the MWSS argued it was a nonprofit service utility created to provide water supply and a wastewater disposal system to Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces.

The MWSS added water stored in Angat Dam did not necessarily come from Bulacan as it was simply stored in the catchment.

The agencies were referring to ""e-waste,"" which is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery, including cellphones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels. It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.

In a report, the U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said some 62 million tons of ""e-waste"" was generated in 2022, enough to fill tractor-trailers that could be lined up bumper to bumper around the globe. It's on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.

Metals -- including copper, gold and iron -- made up half of the 62 million tons, worth a total of some $91 billion, the report said. Plastics accounted for 17 million tons and the remaining 14 million tons include substances like composite materials and glass.

The U.N. says 22% of the e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022. It is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade because of ""staggering growth"" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, growing ""electronification"" of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure, the agencies said.

They said some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well as rare Earth metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers. Currently, only 1% of the demand for the 17 minerals that make up the rare metals is met through recycling.

About half of all e-waste is generated in Asia, where few countries have laws on e-waste or collection targets, according to the report. Recycling and collection rates top 40% in Europe, where per-capita waste generation is highest: nearly 18 kilograms (39 pounds).

In Africa, which generates the least of any of the five big global regions, recycling and collection rates hover at about 1%, it said.

""The latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow,"" said Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, head of the ITU telecommunication development bureau. ""With less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling.""

For some, e-waste represents a way to earn cash by rummaging through trash in the developing world to find coveted commodities, despite the health risks.

At the Dandora dumpsite where garbage collected from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi ends up -- even though a court declared it full over a generation ago -- scavengers try to earn a living by picking through rubbish for e-waste that can be sold to businesses as recycled material.

Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.

""When the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health,"" he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he ""can't come to work because of chest problems.""

However, Okoth said they don't have any other options: ""We are now used to the smoke because if you don't go to work you will not eat.""

Recycling plants, like Nairobi's WEEE center, have collection points across Kenya, where people can safely get rid of old electric equipment.

""We take inventory of the items,"" said Catherine Wasolia, WEEE's chief operating officer, to check for data on submitted devices and wipe them clean. Then they test each to assess if ""it can be reused or repurposed.""

E-waste expert George Masila worries about the impact of electronic waste on soil.

""When you have all this e-waste -- either in the dumpsites or mercilessly deposited anywhere else -- it could have major effects on the soil,"" Masila said. ""Every year it rains and water flows and attracts all these elements that are deposited into the environment. You have water getting contaminated.""

He said greater recycling and re-use of such materials, ""are some of the things we should be considering.""

Report authors acknowledged that many people in the developing world pay their bills through harvesting such e-waste, and called for them to be trained and equipped to make such work safer.

""We must try to support these people trying to find their niche,"" said Ruediger Kuehr, senior manager of the sustainable cycles program at UNITAR.

India accounts for the generation of 350 million tonnes of agro-waste generated every year. Apart from this, thousands of tonnes of waste is generated by factories that manufacture cotton, fruit juice, potato chips, coffee, and more.

It was to make the best of this waste that Dr Sidharth Arora in 2017 launched Fermentech Labs, which uses proprietary micro-organisms and a novel solid state fermentation (SSF) bioreactor to produce industrial enzymes from agro/fruit/forest waste.

Based out of TIDES Business Incubator, IIT-Roorkee, the startup aims to contribute towards a circular bio-economy by converting agro-industrial waste into value-added products such as high-quality industrial enzymes and ensure farmers' prosperity.

""Our technology provides a unique solution that takes care of waste, but also generates enzymes and specialty chemicals for which the market in India is growing at 12 percent. This also addresses the energy crises in India, since the end residue results in fuel pellets that are high in calorific value. We have been able to achieve a high calorific value (CV) of 19.2 MJ/kg from fermented pine needles, and the research outcome has been published in Renewable Energy, a highly reputed peer-reviewed international journal,"" Sidharth says.

The founder says the heterogeneous nature of agriculture biomass provides a unique opportunity to produce a multitude of metabolites of commercial interests.

Fermentech uses carefully designed unit operations to process agro-waste and for reactor operations to ensure multiple products with a high yield. The process yields three products: enzymes, prebiotics, and high CV fuel pellets (for heating boilers).

At present, the startup manufactures four enzymes with wide applications across industries. These include pectinase (used by the fruit juice, wineries, textile, aquaculture industries), amylase (brewery, fruit juice, pharmaceutical, bakery, and textile), xylanase (bakery, animal feed, textile, pulp and paper), and cellulase (animal feed, biofuel, detergents, textile).

In the beginning

The seeds of this startup were sown during Sidharth's PhD days when he was working on a novel SSF bioreactor -- a system that usually involves fermentation of solid waste by fungi for the production of metabolites of commercial interests, under the supervision of Professor Sanjoy Ghosh, Department of Bioscience and Bioengineering, IIT Roorkee.

The challenge with SSF technology is scalability, and the duo was able to demonstrate a modular design with high substrate loading for enzyme production. The results were published in peer-reviewed international journals and a patent was also filed.

""We were able to realise the economic potential of using low-cost raw materials to produce not only enzymes, but also a side stream rich in commercially viable products. This proof of concept was appreciated by BIRAC, Department of Biotechnology, and we were awarded the prestigious Biotechnology Ignition grant. At the time, IIT-Roorkee TIDES Business Incubator was also coming up and provided us legal assistance on company formation, team building, and access to mentors,"" Sidharth says.

In March 2018, they started operations on a lab scale in IIT Roorkee with two reactors: 5 kg and 15 kg capacity. At present, a 150-kg bioreactor is under installation.

Apart from bringing production costs down by using waste as raw material, Fermentech encourages industries to adopt green technologies and reduce their dependence on synthetic chemicals for processing biomass.

""Disposal of agro and fruit waste is a headache for industries. For example, HPMC, an apple juice manufacturing company based in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, generates around 60 tonnes of apple pomace daily. Godrej, on a per-day basis, generates around 200 tonnes of empty palm fruit bunches. Our solution is aligned to not only mitigate the pain point but also add value,"" Sidharth says.

He adds that the startup is directly aligned with the target of doubling farmers' income, reducing carbon emissions, and making India self-sufficient. Around 28 farmers have benefited so far from this, and are making around Rs 5,000 annually.

Fermentech was started with an initial investment of Rs 10 lakh by the founder in 2020. It was awarded a seed fund from BIRAC, through a-IDEA, NAARM, under the BioNest programme to scale enzyme production in 2021. It has also received a seed grant from Engineers India Limited for development of cellulase from agro-waste in 2018.

The startup was among the top 15 grant winners in 2021 of Land Accelerators South Asia, organised by World Resource Institute and Sangam ventures, and was part of the 2018 Indian delegation to Slush, a startup meet in Helsinki, Finland.

Business model and traction

The Indian industrial biotechnology (enzymes) market continued to witness sturdy growth in 2020-21 at 12 percent to touch Rs 2,907 crore during the year as against 10 percent recorded in 2019-20, with the industry crossing Rs 2,500 crore during the year.

Fermentech's business model is focused on sustainability. It works with companies and government bodies that generate agro/fruit/forest waste and for whom disposal is a pain point.

Siddharth says, ""We use this waste as raw material to make industrial enzymes, specialty chemicals, and high CV fuel pellets. Ideally, the company or government will also be a consumer of enzymes. In this win-win model, we aim to scale up operations.""

He cites the example of HPMC and the byproduct it generates: pomace. ""This does not add value to the finished product. The pomace is rich in lingo-cellulosic content and results in increased biological oxygen demand (BOD) when discarded in water bodies and landfills,"" he says.

HPMC generates around 60 tonnes of apple pomace per day during the crushing season and its disposal is a headache for the company. This residue can be used by Fermentech for the production of enzymes such as pectinase.

""HPMC presently imports pectinase for juice clarification, which can be replaced by our product at very competitive price using HPMC's own waste. Plus, they get to use the fermented residue pellets as fuel in their boilers!""

Refusing to divulge names, Siddharth says the startup has two customers, one in the fruit juice sector and other in the bakery industry.

This year, Fermentech Labs has supplied around Rs 50,000 worth of enzymes to the fruit juice, bakery, and the textile industry, and received repeat orders.

""With the facility expected to be fully operational in three months, revenue is expected to increase by at least 20X in the next year. This will be mostly achieved through online distribution channels. We have also applied for FSSAI certification for our food-grade enzymes,"" the founder says.",yourstory.com,news,YourStory.com,,-0.01960784313725494,448926078,1,https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/e641e900925711e9926177f451727da9/CopyofImageTaggingnoframesEditorialTeamMaster-1658842040043.jpg,

The registration process, slated to commence on April 1st, aims to bring retailers and shopkeepers into the tax net, with tax collection set to begin from July 1st, 2024. The cities where the registration process will kick off include Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar.

Under the ambit of this initiative, the FBR will integrate the Online Market Place Platform into the tax network, marking a significant step towards enhancing transparency and efficiency in tax collection.

Special procedures have been devised for small traders and shopkeepers, as outlined in the Special Revenue Order (SRO) issued by the FBR. As per the scheme, every retailer and shopkeeper is mandated to apply for registration under Ordinance 181, with the deadline for registration set for April 30th. The registration process can be conveniently carried out through the Tax App.

A minimum monthly advance tax will be levied on individuals based on their income bracket. For those with an annual advance tax of zero, an annual fee of Rs. 1200 will be applicable.

However, individuals exempt from income tax will be spared from this requirement. Moreover, those who pay their advance tax in full or balance it will enjoy a 25 percent reduction in their overall advance tax liability.

The FBR had earlier unveiled the Merchant Friendly Scheme aimed at bringing traders into the tax net. To facilitate the implementation of this scheme and streamline the registration process, the FBR introduced the 'Merchant Friend' mobile app. Traders outside the tax net will also be registered through this user-friendly app, which will enable the FBR to access records of shopkeepers' income.",dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,Sajid Salamat,0.2313725490196079,448924911,1,https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2024/01/FBR.jpg,eng-9419858

Vehicle excise duty (VED) on all but the cleanest new and used cars will increase from April 1, with an increase of around 6 per cent expected.

For the majority of drivers, the annual cost will go up by between £5 and £10, however, newer vehicles with high emissions could see bills increase by £140 in the first year.

Drivers are being urged to reassess their vehicle's tax status as the April 1 change looms.

Experts at Motor Match warned: ""With April 1 just around the corner, it's a critical time for UK motorists to take note and act to avoid potential fines and disruptions. The upcoming changes to the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates, as outlined in the Autumn Finance Bill 2023, are routine adjustments and represent a significant shift in how vehicle taxation is approached in the UK.

""The increase in VED rates in line with the retail price index starting April 1, 2024, is a wake-up call for all vehicle owners. This adjustment means that the cost of taxing a vehicle is set to rise, reflecting the current economic conditions. Vehicle owners must review their tax status and ensure they are prepared for potentially higher charges.""

""It is crucial to understand that driving without a valid car tax is illegal. Initially, offenders face a £80 fine. However, failure to address this fine can escalate, potentially leading to prosecution and a maximum fine of £1,000. The DVLA also has the authority to clamp vehicles until the outstanding taxes are paid.""

Ensure your vehicle is currently taxed. If you need clarification, the DVLA provides an online service where you can quickly check the tax status of your car.

Understand the New Rates

Familiarise yourself with the new VED rates that will take effect from April 1, 2024. Knowing the exact rate for your vehicle type will help you budget accordingly and avoid any unexpected costs.

Tax Your Vehicle in Advance

If your vehicle tax is due for renewal soon, consider taxing your vehicle before April 1st to avoid the increased rates for another year. This can lead to significant savings, especially for vehicles with higher emissions.

Plan for Zero Emission Changes

Owners of zero-emission vehicles should note the changes coming in 2025 when these vehicles will no longer be exempt from VED.

Ashlyn Watkins stood across from them, orange ""Happy Birthday"" balloon in hand (It wasn't anyone's birthday. Bree Hall accidentally bought the wrong-themed balloons for Senior Day in early March to decorate Te-Hina Paopao's, Sakima Walker's and Cardoso's lockers. Now they're just played with.)

Staley, in true competitive form, urged the sophomore forward to take it easy. March would be the worst time for Watkins to sustain an injury from locker room tomfoolery. But there was no way would Staley let Watkins dunk on her.

""Ashlyn, don't get hurt,"" Staley said with a smile, her voice booming over her team's playful chatter. ""Do not get hurt, Ash. I don't play fair. Do not get hurt.""

Staley tried to bolt, but Kitts, Johnson and Cardoso ducked down to corral her with their arms. Watkins skipped into frame and slammed the balloon over Staley's head. It hit the rim (er, the spot where Johnson's and Cardoso's arms met) and bounced out.

As the balloon floated through the air, Staley tried swatting at it and missed. Kitts lifted her hands to grab it back, ultimately sending the balloon up to a light, where it popped. And Staley gracefully made her exit with a smile plastered all over her face.

This is the youth and exuberance Staley has talked about all year. At first, and still at times, it's a frustrating dynamic for USC's coaches to work with. But they've accepted this is who their players are. And the players view their vibrance, their camaraderie as the key to their success.

""We've built a family over here,"" Kitts said. ""We all just love each other. And that helps so much on the court. Because if you love who you play with and you love who you're friends with, then it just all goes together.""

The Gamecocks were one sleep away from their second-round NCAA Tournament game against the No. 8 North Carolina Tar Heels -- a team they squeaked by with a seven-point victory in November. Youth got the better of South Carolina last time these two teams met. Staley said afterward they didn't ""meet the moment"" in the first half.

""You really saw how young we are,"" she said.

Four months and 27 games have passed since then. Mention that to MiLaysia Fulwiley, and she'll tell you it feels like longer. Not in a bad way, though. This team has been through a lot.

Their bond is apparent during games through moments like this and, of course, the teamwork it takes to go undefeated. While Staley has accepted the group's fun-loving personality, there are still times where she has to shake them into seriousness.

""They live in the moment,"" Staley said. ""And it's great because I live in a moment. If something's funny, I'm gonna laugh. But I can flip it, like, right there because we've got to get back to what's important. They haven't quite mastered that part of it.""

Ashlyn Watkins stood across from them, orange ""Happy Birthday"" balloon in hand (It wasn't anyone's birthday. Bree Hall accidentally bought the wrong-themed balloons for Senior Day in early March to decorate Te-Hina Paopao's, Sakima Walker's and Cardoso's lockers. Now they're just played with.)

Staley, in true competitive form, urged the sophomore forward to take it easy. March would be the worst time for Watkins to sustain an injury from locker room tomfoolery. But there was no way would Staley let Watkins dunk on her.

""Ashlyn, don't get hurt,"" Staley said with a smile, her voice booming over her team's playful chatter. ""Do not get hurt, Ash. I don't play fair. Do not get hurt.""

Staley tried to bolt, but Kitts, Johnson and Cardoso ducked down to corral her with their arms. Watkins skipped into frame and slammed the balloon over Staley's head. It hit the rim (er, the spot where Johnson's and Cardoso's arms met) and bounced out.

As the balloon floated through the air, Staley tried swatting at it and missed. Kitts lifted her hands to grab it back, ultimately sending the balloon up to a light, where it popped. And Staley gracefully made her exit with a smile plastered all over her face.

This is the youth and exuberance Staley has talked about all year. At first, and still at times, it's a frustrating dynamic for USC's coaches to work with. But they've accepted this is who their players are. And the players view their vibrance, their camaraderie as the key to their success.

Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has described the submission of memoranda by governors for state police as a waste of time.

The Oyo governor stated this in an interview on Channels TV on Friday, while faulting the 16 governors' submission of a report on the matter to the National Economic Council (NEC).

Recall that on Thursday, NEC confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police.

The governors had said the state police would address the myriads of security challenges facing the nation.

However, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Reacting, Makinde said, ""I did not submit any memorandum on state police. But my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time.

""I did not submit, not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde said the issue of the state police could best be handled by the National Assembly and not the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it was a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state Houses of Assembly.

The governor said: ""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work.

""It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly. Then, at the state level, we get our state houses of assembly to pass this law.""

Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on February 12 restated their position on state policing, as the solution to the country's worsening security situation.

Regional socio-political groups such as Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, and the Northern Elders' Forum, have repeatedly called for state police as a solution to the nation's increasing security challenges.",saharareporters.com,news,Sahara Reporters,,0.0117647058823529,448923207,1,,eng-9420013

A majority of Conservative voters would prefer an increase in defence spending to tax cuts, according to polling.

A Savanta poll for The Telegraph found that 59 per cent of people who backed the Tories in 2019 say that the Government should increase levels of funding for defence, even if that means reducing its scope for tax cuts.

The findings come after a series of senior Tories called for the party to raise its overall spending on defence to 3 per cent of GDP, in the face of a growing threat from Russia.

Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are gambling on tax cuts as their main election offering to win back disaffected voters who supported the party when it was led by Boris Johnson at the 2019 election.

At the centre of this month's budget was a 2p reduction in National Insurance, amid sustained pressure from senior Conservatives for more tax cuts. But the Chancellor's statement contained no extra funds for the Ministry of Defence despite growing concerns about hostility from Russia and Iran.

Only 27 per cent of 2019 Conservative supporters said the Government should cut taxes, even if that would result in less spending on defence.

Some 700 people who voted Conservative at the last election were surveyed as part of a wider poll of more than 2,000 UK adults.

Findings show voters also backed more health spending over tax cuts, by 65 per cent to 23 per cent. But more Tory voters thought that tax cuts should take priority over increases in the welfare budget than those who disagreed, with almost half (49 per cent) in favour of prioritising tax cuts and 37 per cent opting for higher welfare spending.

Chris Hopkins, Savanta's political research director, said: ""The Prime Minister is betting his and his party's political future on an improving economy that will allow him to dole out tax cuts to a grateful public. But our latest research suggests this might be misguided, with nearly two thirds of Conservative voters wanting him to increase defence spending, even if it means he can't cut taxes.""

Among all voters, including those who backed Labour and the Liberal Democrats in 2019, additional spending on defence, health and welfare was favoured over tax cuts.

Currently, the UK spends around 2.2 per cent of GDP a year on defence, above the 2 per cent target for members of the Nato military alliance. Mr Sunak has said the Government's ambition is to raise that to 2.5 per cent but no specific time frame has been given on when or how that would be achieved.

Many Tory MPs have been pressing for higher levels of defence spending following Russia invasion of Ukraine and the deployment of British warships to the Red Sea to protect vessels from Iranian-sponsored attacks.

Earlier this month, Sir Michael Fallon, Sir Gavin Williamson and Ben Wallace, the former defence secretaries who together headed up the MoD for almost a decade, said that promising 3 per cent spending was essential for the Armed Forces.

Their intervention came after the Commons defence committee warned, following a year-long inquiry, that Britain's ""increasingly overstretched"" Armed Forces were not ready for a war with Russia. The committee's report, published in February, found that the Government ""will never achieve warfighting or strategic readiness"" without urgent reforms to reverse a recruitment crisis and dramatically boost Britain's stockpile of weapons and ammunition.

The MPs said that the Armed Forces required more funding to ""engage in operations whilst also developing warfighting readiness"" or it would have to reduce the ""operational burden"" on the military.

Amid increasing pressure on defence spending, the committee discovered that £1.95 billion of funding awarded in the Budget last spring may now be used to plug shortfalls in defence rather than to replenish and boost stockpiles.

A government source insisted that ministers had already cut taxes and increased defence spending, stating: ""We have put £900 back in the pockets of 27 million workers because it's the right thing to do to allow people to spend more of their own hard-earned cash. But we're also spending a record amount on defence - £50 billion each year - making us the biggest defence spender in Europe and the second biggest in Nato after the US.""

The source added: ""We are committed to increase spending further to 2.5 per cent as soon as we responsibly can.""",telegraph.co.uk,news,The Telegraph,Edward Malnick,0.03529411764705892,448923044,1,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2024/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000364938515_17112092562330_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSX5rhseiWKOo9p9OQ-ymek.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,

With the rising costs of groceries, that means our wallets also take a hit. No one wants their money to go to waste, especially when it comes to feeding themselves and their family -- here, check out these savvy tips from food and money pros that'll make groceries last and save you $100s a year.

MUST-READ:8 Genius Ways to Save at Restaurants So You Can Eat Out for Less + Even Score Freebies

""A costly mistake a lot of us make is tossing out food due to expiration dates. That's why it's good to know some grocery items can last longer than their expiration date suggests,"" says Kimberly Baker, the food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University.

""For example, fresh in-shell eggs, which can cost $4 to $6 per carton, will keep 3 to 5 weeks after their sell-by date if stored properly -- in the refrigerator below 40°F. Store-bought bread, which sells for $3 to $5 per loaf, can last up to 18 days after the sell-by date if stored in a cool, dry pantry. For more info, check out The FoodKeeper app, which was developed by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.""

2. Designate special shelf space

""One of the reasons food like deli sliced meat, which costs between $5 to $10 per pound, or rotisserie chicken, which sells for $8 per chicken, can go bad is that you forget it's there. To combat this, get in the habit of organizing your shelves according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle,"" advises Janilyn Hutchings, food safety professional at StateFoodSafety.com.

""When you're putting away your groceries, put the newer items behind the older ones on the shelf. Or if you have leftovers, put them front and center. That way, you're more likely to grab the oldest food items first, which reduces the chance they'll go bad before you can eat them. You can slash your grocery bill by hundreds annually by incorporating FIFO!""

3. Store herbs this way

""At $2 to $4 per bunch, buying fresh herbs can be pricey! To prolong the life of your cilantro, parsley or other soft herbs, first give them a soak in cold water. Then, instead of buying one of those herb saver containers for $20, simply trim the ends off and store in a mason jar covered with a plastic bag,"" suggests Denise Bustard, food blogger at SweetPeasandSaffron.com.

""Stored this way, fresh herbs can last for up to 2 weeks. Meanwhile, woody herbs like rosemary or thyme last even longer when they are frozen either in an ice cube tray with a tiny bit of water or stored into a zip-top bag. That way, they can be pulled out of the freezer as needed.""

4. Divide fruits and veggies

""To prolong the life of vegetables, the first thing I do when I get them home is to remove them from the packaging. I then store them in clean, dry kitchen towels that allow just enough moisture to keep the vegetables crisp and vibrant,"" says Palak Patel, chef at the Institute of Culinary Education.

""I typically bunch squash, which can cost $3 each, and a bag of $2 carrots in one, and have large salad greens, which can cost $4 a head, in another. If you have a bag of pre-cut lettuce that sells for $4 per clamshell, store it in a zip-top bag with a paper towel inside to absorb any moisture,"" she says.

""Also smart: Keep the tops of your bananas, which sell for 60 cents per pound, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent them from ripening too quickly.""

5. Make groceries last by freezing extra dairy items

""When it comes to buying dairy, save money by stocking up when the price is low and then freezing it all. This allows you to take advantage of good prices on staples like milk, which can cost $3 to $6 per gallon, or cheeses like mozzarella and cheddar, which can each cost $4 per pound,"" says Sara Lundberg, author of Budget Savvy Diva's Guide to Slashing Your Grocery Bill by 50% or More.

""Milk can last for three months in the freezer -- just be aware that it expands when frozen, so leave some room in the container to keep it from bursting. To freeze cheese, just cut it into smaller portions and place in tightly sealed plastic bags. Then you'll always have cheese on hand -- just thaw it in the fridge overnight as needed.""

""For example, fresh in-shell eggs, which can cost $4 to $6 per carton, will keep 3 to 5 weeks after their sell-by date if stored properly -- in the refrigerator below 40°F.

2. Designate special shelf space

""One of the reasons food like deli sliced meat, which costs between $5 to $10 per pound, or rotisserie chicken, which sells for $8 per chicken, can go bad is that you forget it's there. To combat this, get in the habit of organizing your shelves according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle,"" advises Janilyn Hutchings, food safety professional at StateFoodSafety.com.

""When you're putting away your groceries, put the newer items behind the older ones on the shelf. Or if you have leftovers, put them front and center.

Speaking to around 50 activists who gathered outside Inverclyde Council's building, Yousaf (below) said it was ""the greatest honour"" of his life to lead the SNP.

He praised grassroots activists for ""climbing the tenements, putting the leaflets through doors, whatever the weather"", and said their role was ""absolutely crucial"" ahead of the General Election.

He added: ""None of us gets elected without the drive and hard work of activists.""

Rebel regions Inverclyde Council and Argyll and Bute Council both initially refused to adopt the council tax freeze but later U-turned, sparking a ""celebration"" rally by the SNP, which was also attended by Ronnie Cowan (below), SNP MP for Inverclyde.

Yousaf said he felt a decision by leader of Inverclyde Council, Labour councillor Stephen McCabe (below) to increase council tax rates was driven by ""spite"" and ""hate"" of the SNP, and branded the policy U-turn ""embarrassing"".

He urged McCabe to ""step aside and let the SNP group"" run the council, adding: ""They'll happily run the council with a far better job than he is doing.""

However, McCabe described the rally as ""sad"", and wrote on wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""How sad that the First Minister of Scotland travelled all the way from Dundee to Greenock on a Saturday afternoon to stand outside a closed Council headquarters to get his photo taken.""

In a post on Twitter/X, the First Minister said: ""We promised a national Council Tax freeze and that's exactly what @theSNP has delivered. Despite Labour's shameful attempt to hike bills in Inverclyde. In the midst of a Westminster cost of living crisis, @theSNP's fully-funded freeze will support households across Scotland.""

Ahead of the visit, Yousaf said: ""In October last year I promised a national council tax freeze for households across Scotland and that is what the SNP is delivering.

The bill was passed in the House of Representatives on March 18 by a vote of 20-15.

When he opened debate on the bill in the House on that day, Finance Minister Colm Imbert reminded MPs of his statement in the House on March 15 on the intentions behind this bill.

He made the statement after the public raised concerns about the suspension of property-tax payments and in the wake of complaints of the rental valuation of their properties being excessively high.

Imbert said the regulations which were published on March 15 allow indigent, elderly, or infirm people to apply to the Board of Inland Revenue (BIR) for a deferral of property-tax payments.

He also said an order to extend the time for people to object to valuations of their residential properties from 30 days to six months had been published.

Imbert said, that compared to other countries, TT was unique in the number of ways people could challenge valuations of their residential properties. They include raising concerns with the Commissioner of Valuations, the Valuations Tribunal, the BIR, the Tax Appeal Board, and the High Court.

Against that background, Imbert said, ""It would have been quite easy for us to do nothing. But that is not how this government operates.""

The BIR, he continued, was on target to complete the delivery of notices of tax assessment to residential owners before March 31.

""The BIR was quite automated in its process, generating as many as 15,000 notices per day. So they could have easily completed this exercise in a couple of weeks.""

But he reiterated that in light of the public's concerns, the Finance Ministry's permanent secretary has asked the BIR ""just to hold their hand until we sort out these legislative amendments.

""The primary reason why the time period to issue notices of assessment is being extended is to deal with discrepancies in the valuations.""

Imbert said one of the benefits of the bill would be that if people received notices of valuations on their properties last November, they now have until April to challenge those valuations if they think they are unfair.

The bill, he continued, gives Government the opportunity ""to now include in the Property Tax Act a provision where the time for doing anything... delivering notices of tax assessment... the imposition of penalties... and so on... can now be extended, in the same way that it can be done under the Valuation of Land Act.""

Under this legislation, Imbert said, ""There is a provision where the time period to challenge a valuation can be extended by order.

""We are now including a similar provision in the Property Tax Act, so as we go along if we see the need to extend the time by which taxes should be paid... to extend the time by which penalties and interest are to accrue and so on... we can extend.""

Imbert repeated what he told the House on March 15 about the historical complexity involved in the valuation and collection of property taxes. ""This is a work in progress.""

He reminded MPs that the 2009 Property Tax Act was designed to simplify the valuation and collection of property tax because previous pieces of legislation caused vagaries which led to serious inequities in this tax.

He also said one of the features of the bill was to reduce the rate of residential property tax from three to two per cent of a property's ARV.",newsday.co.tt,news,Trinidad and Tobago Newsday,Clint Chan Tack,0.06666666666666665,448921493,1,https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/23222767-1-1024x730.jpg,

""A costly mistake a lot of us make is tossing out food due to expiration dates. That's why it's good to know some grocery items can last longer than their expiration date suggests,"" says Kimberly Baker, the food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University.

""For example, fresh in-shell eggs, which can cost $4 to $6 per carton, will keep 3 to 5 weeks after their sell-by date if stored properly -- in the refrigerator below 40°F. Store-bought bread, which sells for $3 to $5 per loaf, can last up to 18 days after the sell-by date if stored in a cool, dry pantry.

2. Designate special shelf space

""One of the reasons food like deli sliced meat, which costs between $5 to $10 per pound, or rotisserie chicken, which sells for $8 per chicken, can go bad is that you forget it's there. To combat this, get in the habit of organizing your shelves according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle,"" advises Janilyn Hutchings, food safety professional at StateFoodSafety.com.

""When you're putting away your groceries, put the newer items behind the older ones on the shelf. Or if you have leftovers, put them front and center. That way, you're more likely to grab the oldest food items first, which reduces the chance they'll go bad before you can eat them. You can slash your grocery bill by hundreds annually by incorporating FIFO!""

3. Store herbs this way

""At $2 to $4 per bunch, buying fresh herbs can be pricey! To prolong the life of your cilantro, parsley or other soft herbs, first give them a soak in cold water. Then, instead of buying one of those herb saver containers for $20, simply trim the ends off and store in a mason jar covered with a plastic bag,"" suggests Denise Bustard, food blogger at SweetPeasandSaffron.com.

""Stored this way, fresh herbs can last for up to 2 weeks. Meanwhile, woody herbs like rosemary or thyme last even longer when they are frozen either in an ice cube tray with a tiny bit of water or stored into a zip-top bag. That way, they can be pulled out of the freezer as needed.""

4. Divide fruits and veggies

""To prolong the life of vegetables, the first thing I do when I get them home is to remove them from the packaging. I then store them in clean, dry kitchen towels that allow just enough moisture to keep the vegetables crisp and vibrant,"" says Palak Patel, chef at the Institute of Culinary Education.

""I typically bunch squash, which can cost $3 each, and a bag of $2 carrots in one, and have large salad greens, which can cost $4 a head, in another. If you have a bag of pre-cut lettuce that sells for $4 per clamshell, store it in a zip-top bag with a paper towel inside to absorb any moisture,"" she says.

""Also smart: Keep the tops of your bananas, which sell for 60 cents per pound, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent them from ripening too quickly.""

5. Make groceries last by freezing extra dairy items

""When it comes to buying dairy, save money by stocking up when the price is low and then freezing it all. This allows you to take advantage of good prices on staples like milk, which can cost $3 to $6 per gallon, or cheeses like mozzarella and cheddar, which can each cost $4 per pound,"" says Sara Lundberg, author of Budget Savvy Diva's Guide to Slashing Your Grocery Bill by 50% or More.

""Milk can last for three months in the freezer -- just be aware that it expands when frozen, so leave some room in the container to keep it from bursting. To freeze cheese, just cut it into smaller portions and place in tightly sealed plastic bags. Then you'll always have cheese on hand -- just thaw it in the fridge overnight as needed.""

This allows you to take advantage of good prices on staples like milk, which can cost $3 to $6 per gallon, or cheeses like mozzarella and cheddar, which can each cost $4 per pound,"" says Sara Lundberg, author of Budget Savvy Diva's Guide to Slashing Your Grocery Bill by 50% or More.

""Milk can last for three months in the freezer -- just be aware that it expands when frozen, so leave some room in the container to keep it from bursting. To freeze cheese, just cut it into smaller portions and place in tightly sealed plastic bags. Then you'll always have cheese on hand -- just thaw it in the fridge overnight as needed.""

""A costly mistake a lot of us make is tossing out food due to expiration dates. That's why it's good to know some grocery items can last longer than their expiration date suggests,"" says Kimberly Baker, the food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University.

""For example, fresh in-shell eggs, which can cost $4 to $6 per carton, will keep 3 to 5 weeks after their sell-by date if stored properly -- in the refrigerator below 40°F. Store-bought bread, which sells for $3 to $5 per loaf, can last up to 18 days after the sell-by date if stored in a cool, dry pantry.

2. Designate special shelf space

""One of the reasons food like deli sliced meat, which costs between $5 to $10 per pound, or rotisserie chicken, which sells for $8 per chicken, can go bad is that you forget it's there. To combat this, get in the habit of organizing your shelves according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle,"" advises Janilyn Hutchings, food safety professional at StateFoodSafety.com.

""When you're putting away your groceries, put the newer items behind the older ones on the shelf. Or if you have leftovers, put them front and center. That way, you're more likely to grab the oldest food items first, which reduces the chance they'll go bad before you can eat them. You can slash your grocery bill by hundreds annually by incorporating FIFO!""

3. Store herbs this way

""At $2 to $4 per bunch, buying fresh herbs can be pricey! To prolong the life of your cilantro, parsley or other soft herbs, first give them a soak in cold water. Then, instead of buying one of those herb saver containers for $20, simply trim the ends off and store in a mason jar covered with a plastic bag,"" suggests Denise Bustard, food blogger at SweetPeasandSaffron.com.

""Stored this way, fresh herbs can last for up to 2 weeks. Meanwhile, woody herbs like rosemary or thyme last even longer when they are frozen either in an ice cube tray with a tiny bit of water or stored into a zip-top bag. That way, they can be pulled out of the freezer as needed.""

4. Divide fruits and veggies

""To prolong the life of vegetables, the first thing I do when I get them home is to remove them from the packaging. I then store them in clean, dry kitchen towels that allow just enough moisture to keep the vegetables crisp and vibrant,"" says Palak Patel, chef at the Institute of Culinary Education.

""I typically bunch squash, which can cost $3 each, and a bag of $2 carrots in one, and have large salad greens, which can cost $4 a head, in another. If you have a bag of pre-cut lettuce that sells for $4 per clamshell, store it in a zip-top bag with a paper towel inside to absorb any moisture,"" she says.

""Also smart: Keep the tops of your bananas, which sell for 60 cents per pound, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent them from ripening too quickly.""

5. Make groceries last by freezing extra dairy items

""When it comes to buying dairy, save money by stocking up when the price is low and then freezing it all.

""Milk can last for three months in the freezer -- just be aware that it expands when frozen, so leave some room in the container to keep it from bursting. To freeze cheese, just cut it into smaller portions and place in tightly sealed plastic bags. Then you'll always have cheese on hand -- just thaw it in the fridge overnight as needed.""

8044144365,eng,False,2024-03-23,20:07:53,2024-03-23T20:07:53Z,2024-03-23T20:01:35Z,news,0.0,https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/23/avalanche-journal-division-conference-vegas/,Avalanche Journal: Why fretting over where Colorado finishes or potential first-round foes might be a waste of time,"One of the most-asked questions of the Colorado Avalanche for the final month of the season: How much does the team care about winning the Central Division and potentially the Western Conference?

It's top of mind because of how the Avalanche finished last season -- both with a furious charge at the end of the regular season to claim a division title that has become a source of pride, but also an early postseason exit when some of that team's flaws were exposed. A couple of recent trends might help make the answer to that question less important.

The Avalanche has been rolling lately, buttressed by a quartet of new players, the return of Valeri Nichushkin and improved play in net from both goaltenders. In a season where the expectations were clear from the jump -- Stanley Cup or bust -- how the team is playing has been more important than the results for much of the campaign.

If the Avs are playing well without overtaxing the superstars or overplaying the starting goalie, then there's little reason to change anything.

""The important thing is to be playing the right way and you're finding ways to win hockey games consistently,"" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. ""So the confidence in your team grows and you feel good about being able to come back on teams, win home and road, etc. It's important. We're not going to empty the tank, but we're going to play to win and hopefully finish at the top of this thing.""

The second part of this is how stacked the Western Conference is. The top of the Central is the best in the league -- all three teams at the top are Cup contenders -- and the Nashville Predators have surged of late and are now the most successful fourth-place team.

Even if we allow the idea that Colorado could try to win just enough or lose just enough to manipulate its position in the standings and find a favorable first-round matchup, the reality is ... there might not be one. If the Avs win the West and earn the top seed, right now that would mean facing the defending champion Vegas Golden Knights in the first round.

If they win the Central but not the West, that likely means Nashville, a club that has beaten them twice this season and is white hot with a goalie capable of stealing games. And if the Avs don't win the division, that means a first-round dogfight with Winnipeg or Dallas.

""It's still going to get you a really tough opponent,"" Bednar said. ""You finish top of the conference or top of the division and (Vegas) is who you're seeing. That's not an ideal first-round matchup. Playing Winnipeg or Dallas isn't either. You try to take the advantages you can, which is home ice.""

The Avs have been the best team on home ice this season, so getting to play four times out of seven at Ball Arena in as many series as possible could be a worthwhile goal. A recent four-game sweep on the road has also eased whatever concerns there were about the club's road struggles.

Having Game 7 at home last season didn't matter, but this is a different team. And if the first-round opponent doesn't really matter, that small psychological advantage could be the difference.

""I remember this as an opposing player, but it was always when (the Avs) got one, immediately it was 'don't let them get two,' because three and four were coming,"" Avs forward Zach Parise said. ""The building gets going. It feels like you can't breathe, because they were all over you. That's just the way it has been here with this team. Maybe it's the altitude that plays into that, but I just remember it was always hard coming in here.""

Some of the fretting about potentially having to face Vegas is what the Knights could be if everyone is healthy and playing at a peak level. That version of Vegas is terrifying, particularly with new additions that have essentially made this a $100 million roster.

That version of Vegas also hasn't shown up at an NHL rink in months. Sure, adding Noah Hanifin and Anthony Mantha makes the Knights stronger, but Tomas Hertl hasn't played since January. Mark Stone might not be ready for the first round and also hasn't played in a month.

If Vegas gets rolling and gets everyone healthy, it might be the best team in the league. It also might not have everyone available or at 100% in round one, so maybe trying to deal with the Knights immediately is actually the best time.

Or, the best way to look at it is the Avs are almost certainly going to have a tougher path this season than they did two years ago, so focusing on themselves and the process matters even more than the results and who they may or may not have to play.

""The way we're playing now, we're using four lines, pretty balanced minutes coming out of lots of games, we're using both goaltenders. ... We are going to play to win,"" Bednar said.",denverpost.com,news,The Denver Post,Corey Masisak,0.5607843137254902,448920473,1,https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TDP-L-AVS-BLACKHAWKSAO2_1440xxx.jpg?w=640,

""For example, fresh in-shell eggs, which can cost $4 to $6 per carton, will keep 3 to 5 weeks after their sell-by date if stored properly -- in the refrigerator below 40°F.

2. Designate special shelf space

""One of the reasons food like deli sliced meat, which costs between $5 to $10 per pound, or rotisserie chicken, which sells for $8 per chicken, can go bad is that you forget it's there. To combat this, get in the habit of organizing your shelves according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle,"" advises Janilyn Hutchings, food safety professional at StateFoodSafety.com.

""When you're putting away your groceries, put the newer items behind the older ones on the shelf. Or if you have leftovers, put them front and center.

Reacting to the Congress' allegation over the 'freezing' of its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP leader Sambit Patra said, ""All political parties get an exemption in tax. Any party cannot be discriminated against in this. But why were Congress' accounts 'frozen'? The Congress party skipped the tax return deadline and extended deadline in 2017-18.""He further stated that the Congress not only missed the extended deadline for filing tax returns but also exceeded the limit for cash donations.

""In 2017-18, the Congress broke two rules. It missed the extended deadline and exceeded the limit of cash donations. Under Rule 13A, it is clearly mentioned that if these rules are not complied with, the provision for exemptions will be withdrawn. So, in the nomenclature of income tax, the Congress party is defined as an 'association of persons,' and it would be subjected to normal tax liability,"" Patra said at a press conference on Saturday.

The BJP leader noted that all parties receive some exemption in taxes under the provisions of the Constitution.

""All political parties, under the rules of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, are granted an exemption in tax. This is a constitutional provision in India. No parties are discriminated against. The Congress, BJP, and TMC are treated the same,"" he explained.

Explaining why the Congress' accounts were frozen, Patra pointed out that the Congress had missed the extended deadline for paying their tax returns for 2017-18 by December 2018 and paid their taxes only in February 2019.

""Why were Congress' accounts frozen? The assessment for FY 2017-18 was evaluated in 2018-19. The tax had to be collected on the Congress party's business, donations of 2017-18, which had to be paid within the tax return deadline. There is also an extended deadline, and if we do not pay taxes within that date, we have to pay a penalty,"" the senior BJP leader explained.

""The Congress party had an extended deadline of December 31, 2018, to pay their tax return. But the Congress party did not comply with this. They paid their tax return in February 2019,"" Patra further clarified.

Patra also highlighted that the Congress party exceeded the stipulated limit of cash donations and received donations worth Rs 14 lakhs in cash.

""Secondly, any political party cannot accept cash donations of more than Rs 20,000. But when the Congress party's accounts for 2017-18 were assessed in 2018-19, it was found that they had not complied with this rule. Astonishingly, despite knowing the rules, the Congress had accepted a cash donation of Rs 14 lakhs,"" Patra said.

The Congress alleged on Thursday that the BJP froze its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, making it difficult for them to prepare for the elections.

Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi alleged on Thursday that there is a ""systematic effort"" underway by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""cripple"" the Indian National Congress financially, calling it ""unprecedented and undemocratic.""

CHICAGO -- Chicago voters have rejected a one-time real estate tax on properties over $1 million to pay for services for homeless people.

It's a loss for first-term Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who championed the so-called ""mansion tax.""

The proposal would have incrementally raised the city's real estate transfer tax on properties valued at more than $1 million. Supporters estimated it would have generated $100 million annually for homeless services, including for mental health care. There are roughly 68,000 homeless people in Chicago on any given night.

The measure also pitched lowering the transfer tax on properties under $1 million, which represents the vast majority of home sales in the nation's third-largest city.

Opponents, including real estate groups, argued the tax unfairly targets commercial properties and business as downtown is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. They initially won their lawsuit targeting the measure on constitutional grounds, but it was overturned by an appeals court. The Illinois Supreme Court declined their motion for an appeal.

It's not a simple prank, the cutoff to apply for a homestead exemption to lock in your property tax costs is approaching fast.

With a little over a week left until the deadline, the Gwinnett County Tax Commissioner's Office is reminding residents that they can apply for the exemption online and will see the tax savings on their 2024 property tax bills.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

""The fastest way to apply is online at GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com/apply,"" Tax Commissioner Denise R. Mitchell said.

Residents must both own the home they apply the exemption to and have lived there by Jan. 1 of the year they apply. For those applying for the first time for 2024, they'd have had to move into the home on Jan. 1.

For those who moved in after Jan. 1, applications will provide the exemption for 2025's property tax bill instead, according to the commissioner's office.

TRENDING STORIES:

Mitchell said in a statement that having the homestead exemption for a home is a great benefit, adding that anyone with a homestead exemption in Gwinnett County also gets a Value Offset Exemption.

The VOE, according to the tax commissioner's office, keeps the taxable value of a property constant for the county portion of the tax bill, even when the assessed value goes up.

This means that while school and city taxes may increase along with the assessed value, the county tax bill remains the same, for a home and up to five acres of land, the commissioner's office said.

For residents who would like to apply offline, they can go in person to the main property tax office at 75 Langley Drive in Lawrenceville or one of the five tag offices in Gwinnett County.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.192156862745098,448918630,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/wsb_cox_articles_232/c6c0504906601e0b5826359d8f5fbfbe,

The reboot of the hit 90s show was back on our TV screens ahead of next week's final.

Presented by Bradley Walsh and his son Barney, the BBC series sees contestants compete against the gladiators in a series of gruelling challenges. Saturday's show was the last semi-final, having been rescheduled last week due to the football.

This features challenges from the original series, as well as new additions. Among them is the Gauntlet, a 45ft stretch split into five sections with a Gladiator protecting each one.

The Gladiators attempt to block the contestor using ram-rods and power pads, and the contestants need to reach the end before the time runs out. Thanks to the number of Gladiators, it seems like it should be one of the toughest challenges, but viewers disagreed.

Fans took to X, the site formerly known as Twitter, to share their thoughts on how it could be improved. @TheAndylorian said: ""They need to make Gauntlet narrower and longer, it's literally a free ten points."" @CaptMagenta added: ""Need to narrow the gauntlet track. Too easy to get past the gladiators.""

Others said it was a pointless challenge. @ColdMotherWall wrote: ""Gauntlet is such a waste of time."" @lovatt187 said: ""This game is definitely too easy on this reboot! I reckon a person with one leg would get through."" @michellepryde added: ""Gauntlet is far too easy. Either needs dropped next series or changed a bit to make it slightly more harder.""

This legislation, which has received preliminary approval from the European Council and Parliament, carries implications for cryptocurrency transactions across the European Union (EU).

One of the notable provisions of the newly approved legislation is the ban on cryptocurrency transactions facilitated through hosted or custodial wallets provided by third-party service providers. This ban applies irrespective of transaction value and targets centralized exchanges and similar entities. The move reflects efforts to curb potential avenues for money laundering and illicit financial activities within the burgeoning crypto market.

The AML legislation also imposes restrictions on cash transactions and anonymous cryptocurrency payments. Notably, anonymous cash payments exceeding 3,000 euros in commercial transactions will be prohibited, while cash payments surpassing 10,000 euros will face complete prohibition in business dealings. These measures align with broader international efforts to strengthen financial transparency and combat illicit financial flows.

While approving the new AML laws marks a significant step towards bolstering regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency sector, it has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament, registered dissent against the ban on anonymous crypto payments, citing concerns over economic independence and financial privacy. Breyer's opposition underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the balance between regulatory oversight and individual freedoms in the digital asset realm.

Lawan, who was the Chairman of House of Reps Adhoc Committee on Petroleum Subsidy Regime, is being prosecuted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), on behalf of the Federal Government.

On resumption of the case on Tuesday, the Prosecution Counsel, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), informed the court that Otedola, who was giving evidence for the prosecution, was not in court because he was sick.

Awomolo then tendered a medical report notifying the court of the sickness of the Zenon Oil and Gas boss.

The senior advocate said the counsel told the defendant to continue cross examination of the prosecution witness, which started in January.

As a result of the development, Justice Angela Otaluka adjourned the case till June 10 and June 11 for continuation of the hearing.

While being cross examined at the last sitting by Chief Mike Ozekhome SAN, Otedola told the court that Lawan demanded $3 million from him as bribe to exonerate his company from the alleged subsidy scam in 2012.

According to him, the $500,000 he gave the defendant as part payment from the $3million demanded was given to him (Otedola) by the Department of State Service (DSS).

He said the DSS gave him the money following a petition he wrote against the former lawmaker after he made the demand.

The defendant was a four-term member of the House of Representatives, who represented Bagwai/Shanono Federal Constituency of Kano State between 1999 and 2015.

""Indiana and Utah join seven other states in passing laws banning the use of codes to track firearms and ammunition sales,"" The Epoch Times writes.

MCCs are four-digit numbers established by the Switzerland-based International Organization of Standardization (IOS) that identify a type of business and the kind of goods or services it provides. The codes are assigned to businesses by credit card companies and can affect the fees a card user is charged for credit card purchases.

The firearms and ammunition-specific MCC (5723) was created by the IOS on Sept. 9, 2022, in response to a petition from New York-based Amalgamated Bank, which says it supports ""hundreds of progressive political organizations, campaigns, and candidates.""

Amalgamated Bank President and CEO Priscilla Sims Brown said, ""We all have to do our part to stop gun violence, and it sometimes starts with illegal purchases of guns and ammunition.""

""The new code will allow us to fully comply with our duty to report suspicious activity and illegal gun sales to authorities without blocking or impeding legal gun sales,"" she said.

West Virginia, Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, Florida, Montana, and Texas reportedly have also drafted legislation to block the MCC push.

From PR Newswire:

The Firearm Industry Trade Association, applauds Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb for signing House Bill 1084 into law, the NSSF-supported Second Amendment Privacy Act. The law will bar the use of a firearm-retailer specific Merchant Category Code (MCC) for banks, credit card companies or financial service providers to track the lawful sale of firearms and ammunition.

NSSF worked closely with legislators in Indiana to introduce legislation that would protect private and legal purchases from exploitation. HB 1084 is designed to protect the privacy of lawful and private firearm and ammunition purchases from being abused for political purposes by corporate financial service providers and unlawful government search and seizure of legal and private financial transactions.

""Corporate banks and the federal government have already proven they will run roughshod over Second Amendment and Privacy rights. The need to safeguard private and legal purchases of firearms and ammunition by law-abiding citizens has never been greater,"" said Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF Senior Vice President & General Counsel.

""NSSF thanks Governor Holcomb for his leadership in signing this important legislation into law that will protect the rights of the citizens in Indiana. No American should fear being placed on a government watchlist simply for exercising their Constitutionally-protected rights to keep and bear arms,"" Keane added.

""NSSF thanks Governor Holcomb for his leadership in signing this important legislation into law that will protect the rights of the citizens in Indiana.

The tax office had planned to close a tax helpline for half the year, but this plan has now been stopped.

This decision comes after thousands of claimants and taxpayers voiced their concerns about the self-assessment, VAT and PAYE phone services from HMRC. Jim Harra, the boss of the tax office, said that due to ""following feedback from concerned stakeholders"", they have decided to stop the changes to the self-assessment, VAT and PAYE helplines. This will allow more time for discussions to take place, they say.

He said: ""We've listened to the feedback and we're halting the helpline changes, as we recognise more needs to be done to ensure all taxpayers' needs are met, whilst also encouraging them to transition to online services."" He also mentioned that ""the pace of this change needs to match the public appetite for managing their tax affairs online"". The Commons Treasury select committee said it was ""extremely pleased to see that common sense has prevailed"", reports Birmingham Live.

They added: ""We welcome the decision to reverse yesterday's ill-advised announcement. While we do not oppose expansion of digital services for those who want to use them, we remain entirely unconvinced that HMRC is adequately prepared to impose such a significant change in how it serves taxpayers.""

The plans are being halted and phone lines will remain open between April and September. Earlier this week, it had insisted the move is ""a vital element of [its] modernisation of the tax system, allowing more customers to self-serve and access the information they need more quickly and easily"".

The Self Assessment helpline would have been open between October and March to deal with ""priority queries"", while the VAT helpline would have been open for five days each month ahead of the deadline for filing VAT returns. HMRC said this would have meant the Self Assessment helpline would be closed between April and September, and customers would instead be directed to self-serve through its online services.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the U.S. Senate passed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, which contains significant resources to support important institutions and programs in Kentucky. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator McConnell advocated on behalf of the Commonwealth in this year's government funding process. The measure passed both the Senate and the House and was signed into law by the President.

The legislation completes the annual appropriations process for six major areas of the federal government: defense, legislative branch, financial services, homeland security, state-foreign operations, and labor, health and human services, and education.

""The Senate's legislation fulfills our essential government funding responsibilities to the nation and delivers on some of my home state's top priorities.

MCCs are four-digit numbers established by the Switzerland-based International Organization of Standardization (IOS) that identify a type of business and the kind of goods or services it provides. The codes are assigned to businesses by credit card companies and can affect the fees a card user is charged for credit card purchases.

The firearms and ammunition-specific MCC (5723) was created by the IOS on Sept. 9, 2022, in response to a petition from New York-based Amalgamated Bank, which says it supports ""hundreds of progressive political organizations, campaigns, and candidates.""

The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court has framed charges against two men for trying to sell a uranium piece without a valid license in 2020.

While framing charges, the special court observed that the two men - Abu Tahir, 34, a scrap dealer and Jigar Pandya, 31, a freelance event manager - hatched a conspiracy in contravention of the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. As per the court, neither had any license from the Department of Atomic Energy under the Government of India for acquiring or possessing or disposing of the metal.

The court observed that a businessman had sold an article made out of uranium to Tahir's father Mohammad Afzal in 2009. Tahir discovered the metal's identity in 2020 through the internet and found out that its value then was Rs1 crore per kilo. They decided to sell it with the help of Pandya.

When Pandya approached a businessman, he was warned to not get involved but they persisted. Tahir and Pandya were trapped in February 2021, by the Mumbai Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) when they were looking out for customers. A decoy customer was sent by the ATS and a sample was sent for testing.

The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) confirmed the material to be natural uranium, following which an FIR was filed against the two men by the ATS. The agency first arrested Pandya and later Tahir. As per the agency, Afzal said he had landed up with the metal by default as he is a scrap dealer and thought he could make a hammer head due to its weight.

Tony Evers signed education-related legislation Friday, including a measure to tighten protections for students against strip searches and sexual misconduct.

One measure, Senate Bill 111, now 2023 Wisconsin Act 198, was introduced in reaction to a 2022 incident in which a Suring School District employee, who was searching for vaping devices, allegedly ordered six teenage girls to undress down to their underwear. Neither the students' parents or law enforcement were informed about or present at the time of the strip search.

Rep. David Steffen (R-Green Bay), who coauthored the legislation, said in a statement that ""being treated with dignity and basic privacy is something that every student should expect when they enter our schools.

""The event at Suring revealed a statutory loophole that needed to be closed,"" Steffen said. ""This bill will protect our students from experiencing such intrusive searches in the future.""

Another measure, Senate Bill 333, now 2023 Wisconsin Act 200, seeks to better protect students by making sexual misconduct against a student by any school staff member or volunteer a Class I felony. It also adds more violations to the offenses where the state superintendent would be required to revoke a license without a hearing, and prohibits a licensee from ever having their license reinstated by the state superintendent if they are convicted of a crime against a child that is a Class H felony or higher or a felony invasion of privacy or sexual misconduct by a school staff person or volunteer.

""We've started consultations to prepare the next phase of emissions reduction, so post 2030, in Canada, in fact, going to 2035,"" Guilbeault told CTV's Question Period host Vassy Kapelos, in an interview airing Sunday.

Guilbeault said if the Conservatives can point to a measure to fight climate change more effective than the carbon price -- a marquee piece of the Liberals' climate policy -- he's eager to hear it.

""If there's a measure like that lying around under a rock somewhere, someone needs to show it to me, because I haven't seen it,"" he said.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on the distribution of ""tax expenditures""[1] that some are wrongly using to push for additional tax increases. This was inevitable because the report takes the wrong approach to the issue.

Wrongly Named

The CBO misnames ""tax expenditures."" Congress has explicitly inserted these provisions (routinely called ""loopholes"") into the tax code. Some are designed to measure income properly, some to achieve a progressive tax system, and some to lower taxes. They are better referred to as ""tax preferences"" to stress the fact that they are intended to achieve certain goals. Nevertheless, the CBO calls these provisions ""tax expenditures"" -- which implies that there is a meaningful relationship between actual spending and tax reduction -- and explicitly compares tax preferences to spending in its report.

There is a huge moral and economic difference between the government taxing income away from citizens and then spending it and allowing income earners to keep their money by reducing taxes through tax preferences. If tax preferences are akin to spending, then it follows that all the income Americans earn is actually the government's to begin with and that which it does not tax away and munificently lets citizens keep is really a cost to it. President Obama and Vice President Biden often frame their arguments for tax increases in this profoundly troubling way.[2]

Unsurprising Findings

The finding in the CBO report that some are using to make the case for new tax hikes is that high-income taxpayers receive the most benefit from the tax preferences the CBO considered in its analysis. For instance, Congressman Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), ranking member of the House Budget Committee, who requested the study, instantly called for Congress to eliminate tax preferences for high earners as way to raise more revenue for the government.[3]

An in-depth CBO report was not necessary to reach that conclusion, because it is wholly unsurprising. Of course tax preferences benefit high-income taxpayers more, because high-income taxpayers pay the lion's share of the tax burden.[4] It is also self-evident because it is primarily upper-middle-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions. Naturally, policies that reduce taxes lower the tax bills of those taxpayers who otherwise pay the most tax.

Includes Policies Necessary for Sound Tax Code

In the group of tax preferences the CBO analyzed, it wrongly includes policies that are necessary for establishing a sound tax code. In reality, all tax preferences are not created equal. Some, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable contributions, ensure that the tax code does not interfere with economic decision making. These policies should remain in the tax code even after fundamental tax reform.

Without the mortgage interest deduction, lenders would pay tax on the interest they earn and borrowers on the interest they pay. Levying tax on both would create a distortion against investing in housing. The charitable deduction eliminates tax on income that taxpayers earn but do not spend. Taxing them on that income would create a bias against giving and hurt civil society by reducing donations to charities. In this case, the tax preference is not the donation but the tax-exempt status of the organizations receiving donations. Since those organizations are usually nonprofits, they normally do not owe tax on their income. However, the recipients of the contributions -- whether employees, suppliers, or consultants -- do.

Others preferences are certainly less defensible, and Congress should abolish them through revenue-neutral tax reform. The least defensible preferences are credits -- for instance, residential energy credits and credits for investing in certain designated markets.[5] Even so, these policies should not be viewed as spending.

The biggest tax preference in the CBO report is the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance. While this preference would not be part of a neutral tax code, the entanglement of health insurance and the tax code is a historical artifact that cannot be easily undone. It is problematic to include it with all tax preferences while not addressing this important fact.[6]

Leaves Out Major Tax Preferences

The CBO determines what qualifies as a tax preference by comparing the current tax code to what it believes a true income tax would look like. The problem with this method is that it is subjective. There is no textbook definition of an income tax. This means that the CBO leaves out policies that others would consider legitimate tax preferences. The CBO does address this issue in its report, but rather than attempt to identify what policies it believes are the right tax preferences, it adopts the flawed and incomplete list used by the Treasury Department and White House Office of Management and Budget.

For instance, the CBO does not include in its analysis the standard deduction or personal exemptions, even though both policies are deviations from a standard income tax and are major revenue reducers that benefit mostly low- and middle-income taxpayers. Including them would significantly shift the CBO's findings and show that tax preferences benefit low- and middle-income taxpayers more than the CBO finds in its report.

The same applies to a tax code that uses multiple tax rates. A standard income tax has a single tax rate applied to properly measured taxable income. Yet the CBO ignores the lower tax burden resulting from the lower tax rates paid by the majority of taxpayers. Ignoring major tax preferences that primarily benefit low- and middle-income taxpayers provides yet another reason it is hardly surprising that the CBO finds that tax preferences primarily benefit upper-income taxpayers.

Includes Polices That Are Not Tax Preferences

The CBO includes the exemption of retirement savings plans, such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts, as a tax preference. But retirement savings plans are vital for preventing a portion of savings from unjustified multiple layers of taxation.[7] Similarly, the CBO includes lower rates on capital income earned through capital gains and dividends, yet these rates are necessary to reduce the economically harmful double taxation of capital, since it is taxed first at the corporate level.

It is odd that the CBO would fail to argue that lower marginal income tax rates are tax preferences but in the same report hold that lower rates on capital gains and dividends are. If lower rates on capital income are considered tax preferences, then lower marginal rates on income must be as well. That is not to argue that lower rates on capital income should be a tax preference; rather, it reveals inconsistencies in the CBO's approach.

Not taxing contributions to retirement savings plans is not a tax preference. In fact, in a neutral tax system, such as The Heritage Foundation's New Flat Tax,[8] taxpayers would not pay tax on any of their savings -- whether for retirement or for any other reason -- and there would be no capital gains and dividends taxes.

CBO Hurts Tax Reform Efforts

There is broad agreement that the country needs fundamental tax reform. House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) is working assiduously on a plan. Retiring chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Max Baucus (D-MT) is ramping up his efforts as well.

However, by distorting the debate, this CBO report will hamper their efforts. Liberals will use it to argue for tax increases on the rich by eliminating their tax preferences without including pro-growth and revenue-neutral changes to the tax code. CBO analysis should be an asset, not a liability, when it comes to freeing the economy from the burdensome tax code.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Curtis Dubay,-0.03529411764705881,448913477,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,eng-9411982

In 1982, I was a young guy, married a year, with an infant at home. I had no education past high school and no military experience yet. My prospects were limited at that time, but I stubbornly declined welfare benefits and worked two jobs, one of them being on the third shift, as I was determined to take care of my young family myself.

Even so, when I heard that there was to be a giveaway of something called ""government cheese,"" I thought, why not? I didn't know why the government had cheese or why they were giving it away, but one morning after work--tired, grubby, and unshaven--I pulled on my ragged old overcoat against the Iowa winter chill and went down to the giveaway location.

I didn't give much thought to the fact that I looked like a street bum, even when I noticed the news crew filming the event. I didn't give it any thought until late that day, when I had woken from my daytime sleep to hear the phone ringing. My wife answered it and called me into the kitchen. She handed me the handset: ""It's your Grandma.""

This was curious, as Grandma wasn't much of one for talking on the phone. ""Grandma?""

""Honey,"" she said, ""I saw you on the TV news just now. You looked so tired! Are you OK? Do you need anything? I can help you with groceries.""

I was mortified. It wasn't that I had gone down and gotten government cheese from the giveaway. It was that my grandmother saw me on television, grubby and tired, picking up free cheese.

Now, I told you that story so I could tell you this one.

Many years went by without my giving government cheese another thought. But recently I stumbled across the fact that, indeed, there is still such a thing as government cheese. In fact, there's a whopping huge amount of it, hidden away in caves in Missouri, and what's more, according to this March 2023 article in the Science Times, the story behind government cheese is a brilliant example of how screwed up things get when the government fiddles with markets.

Missouri cheese caves are deep within the Ozark Mountains' heart under Springfield. Made of converted limestone mines, the caves are perfectly kept at 36 degrees Fahrenheit to give an ideal environment for storing stockpiles of government-owned cheese.

It all started in the 1970s when the U.S. suffered from a national dairy shortage which was made worse by 30% inflation on dairy products. In response to the economic crisis, then-President Jimmy Carter decided to spend money on the dairy industry to encourage dairy production.

The government set A [sic] new policy where a two-billion-dollar budget was allotted to subsidize dairy products over the next four years. This plan was favorable to farmers but also led them to overproduce dairy products. The farmers became motivated to produce as much dairy as they could because they knew that whatever was not sold on the market would be bought by the government.

Did you get that? The federal government, in its infinite wisdom, started subsidizing dairy farmers to produce milk. I grew up in dairy country in northeast Iowa, and I remember farmers adding to their herds and ramping up production; at that time, I didn't know why.

What do you suppose happened then? The farmers responded to the incentive by producing more milk, and more milk, and more milk. This would normally have had the effect of driving prices down, which would have disincentivized the farmers, who would have normally started producing less milk until supply and demand balanced out and things became reasonable.

But that's not what happened. What happened was, that the federal government started buying milk and, to make it storable for prolonged periods, converted it to cheese. Thus: Government cheese, and plenty of it.

Most dairy products were converted to cheese because they have a longer shelf life. By the early 1980s, the government-owned more than 500 million pounds of cheese. Because of this, the next U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, had to pass a law in 1981 enacting the public distribution of government-owned cheese.

That year, the Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block showed up to the media and announced that the government owned 60 million pieces of five-pound blocks of cheese. From then on, the term ""government cheese"" was born. The federal government distributed the cheese blocks through the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).

In the years that followed, the demand for cheese declined, but the production rate remained the same as the government continued to support dairy producers. As of 2019, the collection comprises almost 1.4 billion pounds of surplus cheese in the U.S.

So, the federal government, with your tax dollars, has produced 1.4 billion pounds of cheese and has it stored in caves in Missouri.

All the cheese is still there, presumably awaiting another Ronald Reagan, who will crack open the cheese vaults and give back to the American people the cheese that they have, after all, already paid for. The problem is, that dumping a billion-and-a-half pounds of cheese on the market will have a brutal effect on cheese prices and American dairy farmers. It's difficult to see a good way out of this mess now. Once again the federal government has tossed a bunch of taxpayer money after a problem that would have resolved itself if just left alone. Forty years later, we are still paying for it.

This entire debacle is a textbook example of why government shouldn't mess around with markets. If Jimmy Carter had just left well enough alone, the increases in dairy prices would have led to a natural, gradual increase in production, and before long, supply and demand would have balanced, as they always do when politicians just keep their fingers out of it. Dairy prices would have normalized, little kids would still have gotten their milk at lunchtime, and we taxpayers wouldn't have paid for the federal government's accumulation of 1.4 billion pounds of cheese, not to mention paying for storing it in the infamous Missouri cheese caves. (I'm pretty sure I saw the Missouri Cheese Caves open for Robert Palmer in 1984.)

I'll keep saying it until I turn blue: Markets aren't perfect, but they generally get things right if they are left alone. The problem is that the government just can't leave them alone.

The ""disproportionate representation"" of William Shakespeare in the theatre has propagated ""white, able-bodied, heterosexual, cisgender male narratives"", according to researchers in an £800,000 taxpayer-funded project.

The claim has prompted critics to accuse the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which has funded the study by academics at the University of Roehampton, of promoting ""cultural clickbait"".

The project, devoted to ""centring marginalised communities in the contemporary performance of early modern plays"", is due to be completed in two years' time.

The researchers want to challenge the ""normative trend"" in ""classical theatre"" arising from ""the disproportionate representation of William Shakespeare in scholarship and performance"".

In response they are mounting a production of a comedy by Shakespeare's contemporary John Lyly, Galatea, which features characters disguised as the opposite sex. The researchers say the play offers ""an unparalleled affirmative and intersectional demographic, exploring feminist, queer, transgender and migrant lives"".

They say the play ""has almost no stage history since 1588"", adding that ""Diverse Alarums"", the name of the project, ""will transform this state of affairs with a unique combination of methods, ranging across early modern studies, practice-as-research, audience studies, qualitative research, trans, queer and disability studies"".

Writing for the website Before Shakespeare, Andy Kesson, the project's principal investigator, said that ""masculinity and nationalism were crucial motivating factors in the rise of Shakespeare as the arbiter of literary greatness"" and that ""[w]e need to be much, much more suspicious of Shakespeare's place in contemporary theatre"".

'His themes are timeless'

Lionel Shriver, the author, told The Telegraph: ""In Shakespeare's day, half the European population was white and male. They didn't have rainbow flags. Being disabled like Richard III was a matter of character rather than politics, and luckily for them no one had ever coined the linguistic abomination 'cisgender'.

""Still germane because his themes are timeless, Shakespeare will survive even this dogmatic mangling, and his plays will continue to be enjoyed long after today's 'intersectional' performances have foreshortened into a freakish comical footnote in theatrical history.""

Andrew Doyle, the comedian and author, said: ""There's a very good reason why Shakespeare is performed frequently and John Lyly barely at all. Shakespeare was by far the superior playwright. Yet again, ideologues are reducing great art to mere mechanisms for the promotion of an ideology.

""A production of Galatea would be welcome, but given that those behind it are already using anachronistic pseudo-religious terms such as 'cisgender' suggests that it will be a tedious affair. They evidently believe what they are doing is radical, but virtually all theatre companies today are obsessed with identity and gender, and so this is likely to be just more conformist and insipid propaganda.""

Jane Stevenson, the Conservative MP, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ""Theatre does and should entertain, challenge and educate us. I'm all for widening repertoire to bring lesser-known works to audiences, but I'm not sure reducing Galatea to a celebration of all things woke, or knocking Shakespeare for being pale, male and stale is much more than cultural click-bait.

""Shakespeare's works have been translated into 100 languages and clearly still resonate with people all over the world. Love, hate, ambition, loss, jealousy - all universal emotions we all still identify with.""

An Arts and Humanities Research Council spokesman said: ""The Arts and Humanities Research Council invests in a diverse research and innovation portfolio. Decisions to fund the research projects we support are made via a rigorous peer review process by relevant independent experts from across academia and business.""

A spokesman from the University of Roehampton said: ""This project was funded by a national organisation following a rigorous review process. We support academic colleagues to seek external funding to pursue high-quality research in their areas of specialism, which in this case involves national theatre heritage.""",telegraph.co.uk,news,The Telegraph,Charlotte Gill,0.1529411764705881,448912351,1,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2024/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000237488734_17112120677580_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZa38qYFHhStG5_ukHIm-7ufF-YV9CeDSIRiKNFnYCcQ.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay,

Dr. Bawumia during a meeting with the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, voiced concerns about the alleged use of tax collection by GRA staff as a pretext for harassing businesses.

In response to this, the Organized Labour in a statement dated Friday, March 22, 2024, described Dr Bawumia's comments as ""unfortunate"", viewing them as a slight against the diligent efforts of GRA employees.

""We would like to state unequivocally that, we the workers of GRA find this statement unfortunate and consider it as an attack on the efforts of the hard-working staff of the Authority which if not discontinued, would incur the displeasure of workers, disrupt revenue collection efforts and breed industrial disharmony.""

They warned that such statements could lead to worker discontent, hinder revenue collection, and cause industrial unrest.

The group further urged the Vice President to either acknowledge the significant advancements made by GRA or refrain from making remarks that undermine their work.

They highlighted the contradiction in Dr Bawumia's stance, given his role as Head of the Economic Management Team and his awareness of the government-set targets for the Authority through the Ministry of Finance.

""It is strange that the Vice President, who also doubles as the Head of the Economic Management Team could suggest that the Authority gives itself unrealistic targets while he is well aware that annual targets are assigned to the Authority by the government through the Ministry of Finance.

""Indeed, the least we expect from the Vice President, if he would not appreciate the efforts of the Authority in raising Tax Revenue, is not to put the lives of our hardworking staff at risk with such unfortunate comments.""

Organized Labour emphasized the potential negative impact of the Vice President's statements on future revenue mobilization and appealed to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to address the issue with his Vice.

""We also call on the President of the Republic of Ghana, H.E. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the GRA Board, Civil Society organizations and all well-meaning Ghanaians to admonish political functionaries to desist from making such pronouncements and intervene swiftly as this statement poses a major risk to revenue mobilization efforts going forward.""

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",lamarledger.com,news,Lamar Ledger,,0.05882352941176472,448911583,1,https://www.lamarledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

The remarks came as the GNIDA in its response, on February 2, 2024, had submitted that it was facing several ""challenges"" as villagers were reluctant to get sewer connections besides other hindrances, including digging of access road for laying sewer line through densely populated areas with narrow lanes citing the work would be an obstruction to access and movement.

The NGT, hence, observed that the authority as well as Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) were responsible for not taking adequate action, and ""directed member secretary, UPPCB, to look into the matter and take appropriate action including against the persons responsible for inaction"".

Hearing the case on March 19, an NGT bench comprising judicial member -- Justice Sudhir Agarwal, and expert member -- A Senthil Vel, said, ""It is very unfortunate that in the matter of governance, the statutory body is showing helplessness or inability to get the work done, though it is its responsibility.""

The NGT bench said discharge of untreated sewage or polluting material on land, river or stream is completely prohibited by Section 24 of Water Act, 1974 and non-compliance thereof is an offence under Section 43 of the Act, for which, criminal prosecution can be initiated against the violators.

""Section 47 of the Water Act, 1974, further says in respect of company or statutory bodies, persons responsible for day-to-day function of the body shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence,"" it said.

If an effective action to stop discharge of untreated sewage on the land or river or stream is not undertaken, the officials of GNIDA are responsible, and ""they are in fact committing an offence under the provisions of Water Act, 1974, for which action is required to be taken"", the bench said.

According to regional officer of the UPPCB (Greater Noida) Deo K Gupta, most of the villages developed in the floodplains of Hindon are responsible for discharging untreated sewage in the water bodies, thereby polluting them.

""It is primarily the responsibility of the district administration, GNIDA to ensure that these illegally developed houses are removed from the floodplains. Any unauthorised land-use has to be checked by these government bodies and so far, even demarcation of these illegal villages/establishments couldn't be completed,"" the official said.

""Pollution board is being named here just for the fact that it is an environment-concerning matter. If an establishment constructed in floodplain seeks for an NOC for sewage treatment plant (STP), we won't approve of it,"" the officer added.

The NGT bench, based on the response submitted by GNIDA, observed that only minor details were given in the submitted report. It pointed out that of the total 115 villages (a revised figure following corrections by GNIDA on previously stated123 villages) under GNIDA's ambit, only 39 villages have been connected with STPs as on December, 2023.

Details of the volume of sewage being generated by these villages, bifurcation as to how much quantity sewage separately is being supplied to STPs for treatment and whether STPs are functioning as per the prescribed standards, were missing in the report.

The GNIDA has now sought time from the tribunal to work on the laxities and provide missing details in the report.

According to Vinod Sharma, senior manager (in-charge sewer), GNIDA, the authority is taking up adequate steps to address the issues and working constantly for building a sewage network.

Villagers, however, are reluctant in getting sewer connections even though it is free of cost, as they entail it would lead to breakage or construction in their houses, he said, adding that they are also apprehensive that they might be charged for it in future.

""There are other hindrances as well including challenges in digging of access road for laying sewer lines from individual houses to manholes. The villages are densely-populated and these are the facts that were included in the report. However, we have sought for some extra time,"" the official further added.

In January, 2024, the GNIDA submitted that there were 31 villages that had to be connected with STP by 2027-end (post approval of land use master plan).

Of the total 11,152 households in these villages, 7,280 have sewer connections whereas the process to provide sewer connection to 3,874 households was underway, it added.

""Despite several issues at hand, appropriate measures are being taken. A three-tier approach has been adopted, involving hiring of supervisors and other services to monitor sewer issues in the villages. Services of other departments, including Jal Nigam, shall also be roped in to expedite the process of connecting remaining villages to STPs. By 2024-end, 45 more villages will be connected to the network"", the official said.

The NGT has sought for further progress report from GNIDA showing status as on June 30, 2024, by July 15, 2024, including details of total sewage generated, bifurcation of discharge of sewage in STPs, treatment standards and parameters. An action taken report has also been sought by the UPPCB.

The court deemed the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 (Madarsa Act) unconstitutional due to its violation of the principles of Secularism and various articles of the Constitution of India, including the ""Right to Equality"" article 14 and ""Right to Life and Education"" articles 21 and 21-A, as well as Section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956, which is related to the right to confer degrees.

Furthermore, the court directed the State Government of Uttar Pradesh to immediately accommodate Madarsa students in recognized secular schools, ensuring sufficient additional seats and, if necessary, establishing new schools to prevent children aged 6 to 14 years from being left without admission.

Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, expressed his disappointment with the judgment. He stated, ""I think there is a need to challenge the judgment (by Allahabad High Court) in Supreme Court. We hope that justice will be served in this case.""

Prior to the independence of India in 1947, private Madarsas in Uttar Pradesh continued to operate without recognition from the state government, providing education at the local level. In 1969, the state government introduced rules for the recognition of Arabic and Persian Madarsas, outlining criteria such as infrastructure, financial status and teaching staff. These rules were followed by the introduction of non-statutory regulations in 1987.

Per the ""Statement of Object and Reasons"" of the Madarsa Act, the state government established the Minority Welfare Department in 1995, transferring responsibilities related to minority institutions and Madarsas from the Education Department to this new department. Subsequently, in 2004, the Madarsa Act was enacted to address the challenges faced by Madarsas operating under the earlier regulations. The Act aimed to establish a Board of Madarsa Education in the state to improve the quality of education and facilities for students studying in Madarsas.

Madarsas are Islamic educational institutions where students study various aspects of Islam, including the Quran, Islamic law (Sharia), theology and Arabic language. They have been a traditional form of education in many countries with Muslim populations for centuries. Madarsas typically emphasize memorization of the Quran and the teachings of Islamic scholars. However, they vary in curriculum and focus, with some providing a broad education while others concentrate solely on religious studies. There are reportedly around 24,000 Madarsas present in India.",jurist.org,news,JURIST,Shashank Pandey,0.1372549019607843,448911524,1,https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/03/Darul_Uloom_Deoband_2018.jpg,eng-9416992

""March Madness"" could be a name not only for the NCAA basketball tournament but also for the annual tax-return season, which hits full swing this month. If you're one of the millions of employees in the United States with nonqualified stock options or restricted stock units, or if you participate in an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), income from your equity awards last year will complicate your tax return.

Nobody likes doing homework for the IRS, but the handy ""cheat sheet"" in this article below can make the assignment easier for tax returns involving equity compensation and company stock sales. Even if you hire a professional preparer to handle your tax return, such as a CPA or enrolled agent, check your return for these items. You don't want to overpay taxes or draw unwanted IRS attention that leads to a scary notice or audit.

Compensation Income

Stock compensation, along with your salary income, is included in what is reported in Box 1 of your Form W-2. You enter the amount in Box 1 on Line 1a of Form 1040.

Alert: Be sure you don't double-report any stock compensation income that also appears in Box 12 or 14 of your W-2 (or on a paystub).

If you sold shares during the prior tax year -- even shares sold immediately at exercise, vesting, or purchase for no additional gain beyond what's on your W-2 -- you still separately report each sale. You then report that Schedule D capital gain/loss total on Line 7 of Form 1040.

Alert: Should you not report the sale, the IRS will almost certainly send you a notice demanding taxes on the full amount of your unreported sale proceeds. That would require you to potentially amend your tax return or engage in ongoing communications with the IRS to explain the situation. Not fun.

Check The Cost-Basis Reporting For Company Stock Sales

Here comes the really tricky part: adjusting the cost basis (or tax basis) of equity awards, i.e. the full cost of shares that generated compensation income. The cost basis is subtracted from your proceeds to calculate your gain or loss for tax purposes.

For shares bought in the open stock market, your cost basis is the purchase price. With equity compensation, the basis calculation includes the cost plus any compensation income recognized -- for example, the exercise spread of nonqualified stock options (NQSOs) or the value of the shares at the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs).

Form 1099-B reports your basis in Box 1e. Instead of boxes, your broker's substitute statement will use columns numbered the same as the boxes on Form 1099-B. The same numbering is used on Form 8949.

However, the cost-basis information reported to the IRS by your broker in Box/Column 1e of Form 1099-B may be too low, or the box may be blank. IRS rules do not allow your broker to include the compensation income in the basis that's reported on the 1099-B.

Alert: If the basis listed on the 1099-B is your option exercise price or your ESPP purchase price (or simply $0), then it is likely to be incomplete. You are at risk for overpaying your taxes. An adjustment will be needed on IRS Form 8949, which is used to report the sale, and its totals then funnel into Schedule D.

Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

For a few years now, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) has not had its own line on the main Form 1040 -- but that doesn't mean it's gone away! The AMT remains a concern for everyone with incentive stock options (ISOs). It is calculated on Form 6251:

Exercise year: The spread at ISO exercise is reported on Line 2i if the stock was not sold during the calendar year of exercise. Sale year: After you sell ISO stock that triggered the AMT, the difference from the ordinary income tax is reported on Line 2k.

If your AMT is higher than your regular tax, you report this additional amount from your Form 6251 calculation on Line 1 of IRS Schedule 2 (""Additional Taxes""). The totals from Part I of Schedule 2 go into Line 17 on Form 1040.

After you trigger the AMT from an ISO exercise, you get an AMT credit that you can apply in every subsequent year when your ordinary income tax exceeds your AMT. You use Form 8801 to calculate how much of the credit you can apply each year. You carry forward the rest.

Alert: You do not need to sell the ISO stock to start using up the AMT credit. You continue to complete Form 6251 and 8801 each year until the credit is used up.

Equity Compensation Income Left Off W-2

What if your company does not report your employee stock compensation income on Form W-2? According to recent changes to Schedule 1 of Form 1040 and its instructions, the amount goes in the ""Other Income"" section on Line 8k (""Stock Options"").

If you are not certain that all equity compensation left off the W-2 goes on Line 8k, then it can fit into Line 8z (""Other Income. List type and amount"").

Estimated Taxes

The flat 22% rate often used for federal supplemental withholding on employee stock compensation may not cover the actual taxes you owe, given your marginal tax rate. You may have decided to pay estimated taxes to cover the additional taxes owed. On Form 1040, you report estimated tax payments on Line 26.

IRS Form 1099-NEC For Nonemployees

Nonemployees, such as consultants and directors, have no withholding and no W-2 reporting for stock comp income. Income from exercise or vesting appears on IRS Form 1099-NEC (""Nonemployee Compensation"") as self-employment income. This is shown in Boxes 1 and 7 of Form 1099-NEC. You report that income on Schedule C of your Form 1040 tax return.

As this is self-employment income, you also need to calculate on Schedule SE any Social Security and Medicare taxes that you owe.

Reacting to the Congress' allegation over the 'freezing' of its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP leader Sambit Patra said, ""All political parties get an exemption in tax. Any party cannot be discriminated against in this. But why were Congress' accounts 'frozen'? The Congress party skipped the tax return deadline and extended deadline in 2017-18.""

He further stated that the Congress not only missed the extended deadline for filing tax returns but also exceeded the limit for cash donations.

""In 2017-18, the Congress broke two rules. It missed the extended deadline and exceeded the limit of cash donations. Under Rule 13A, it is clearly mentioned that if these rules are not complied with, the provision for exemptions will be withdrawn. So, in the nomenclature of income tax, the Congress party is defined as an 'association of persons,' and it would be subjected to normal tax liability,"" Patra said at a press conference on Saturday.

The BJP leader noted that all parties receive some exemption in taxes under the provisions of the Constitution.

""All political parties, under the rules of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, are granted an exemption in tax. This is a constitutional provision in India. No parties are discriminated against. The Congress, BJP, and TMC are treated the same,"" he explained.

Explaining why the Congress' accounts were frozen, Patra pointed out that the Congress had missed the extended deadline for paying their tax returns for 2017-18 by December 2018 and paid their taxes only in February 2019.

""Why were Congress' accounts frozen? The assessment for FY 2017-18 was evaluated in 2018-19. The tax had to be collected on the Congress party's business, donations of 2017-18, which had to be paid within the tax return deadline. There is also an extended deadline, and if we do not pay taxes within that date, we have to pay a penalty,"" the senior BJP leader explained.

""The Congress party had an extended deadline of December 31, 2018, to pay their tax return. But the Congress party did not comply with this. They paid their tax return in February 2019,"" Patra further clarified.

Patra also highlighted that the Congress party exceeded the stipulated limit of cash donations and received donations worth Rs 14 lakhs in cash.

""Secondly, any political party cannot accept cash donations of more than Rs 20,000. But when the Congress party's accounts for 2017-18 were assessed in 2018-19, it was found that they had not complied with this rule. Astonishingly, despite knowing the rules, the Congress had accepted a cash donation of Rs 14 lakhs,"" Patra said.

The Congress alleged on Thursday that the BJP froze its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, making it difficult for them to prepare for the elections.

Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi alleged on Thursday that there is a ""systematic effort"" underway by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""cripple"" the Indian National Congress financially, calling it ""unprecedented and undemocratic.""",dtnext.in,news,dtNext.in,,0.1450980392156862,448910649,1,https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/03/23/811309-17.jpg,

The entire project could take up to three months to complete. The cost will be substantial.

It is also likely to lead to significant traffic disruption, with contractors required to have major traffic management plans in place for the duration of the works. Businesses will be informed in advance.

The news was confirmed over the weekend on the back of sustained criticism of City Hall in recent weeks over the crossings' defective surfaces and the unsightly patchwork temporary repairs.

The project will involve major repairs and restoration to several brickwork pedestrian crossings along St Patrick's St, which were installed as part of the Beth Gali-designed streetscape revamp over two decades ago.

Several crossings along the Grand Parade, which was upgraded in the same style some years later, and where patchwork repairs have also been done at Finn's Corner and Nano Nagle Bridge, are also in line for repair and restoration.

Former lord mayor Mick Finn, along with several councillors in the south-central local electoral area in which the city is located, raised the issues of defective pedestrian crossings, the need to address dereliction, and the city's general maintenance regime with council management and urged a regime of 'constant reviewing' to ensure issues are identified and dealt with.

""There have been criticisms of the way the brickwork has been filled in with tarmac and other temporary measures, so it's good to hear the crossings will be renewed and revitalised,"" he said.

This is bread and butter stuff that when done correctly is very visible and very beneficial to locals and tourists alike.

""City centres all over the world are challenged in numerous ways in terms of transport, retail, and livability so it's important for those that influence what goes in cities to be constantly on the ball.

""We are seeing signs beginning to sprout -- the new Premier Inn on Morrison's Island, the redevelopment of the Roches Stores building -- so it's crucial we build on those.

Fianna Fail TD Eamon O Cuiv this week urged for the Government to stop ""wasting"" around €1.9m a year on troops at Portlaoise Prison.

The Defence Forces provide security at the slammer, home to some of the nation's most notorious criminals.

It also houses Republican paramilitaries on E Block.

Speaking in the Dail, O Cuiv questioned Tanaiste Micheal Martin on the continued need for the Army at Portlaoise.

He said: ""I met the Tanaiste in December 2020, at which time there were 29 prisoners in the E Block in Portlaoise prison.

""There are now fewer than ten. By mid-summer, the figure could be half that again.

""Does the Tanaiste not agree that is a ­radically different situation from the situation that caused the Army to be deployed to the prison in the first place?""

He added: ""Some prisoners there are near the end of their sentences, with one prisoner due out next month. We are, therefore, talking about a small number of people.

""There are all sorts of other prisoners in the prisons who are high risk.

""It seems amazing that this small number of prisoners needs the Army to secure them when none of the other prisoners in the whole prison system, who are in for very significant crimes, needs this.

""We have to recognise there is a changed dynamic here.

""We need to build on that in a positive way to try to get everybody to move forward and to realise there is a political way and space for all political opinions, as long as they are followed peacefully in this country.""

Responding, Defence Minister Micheal Martin confirmed the number of soldiers stationed at the base is reducing in line with the threat posed, with the long term aim to remove them from the prison entirely.

He said: ""The traditional resource commitment of 100 personnel is now down to 16. I have instructed that there be a further phased reduction.

""There has been a substantial reduction in line with the security assessment and in consultation with the Department of Justice, following recommendations from the Commission on the Defence Forces.

""We intend that the prison authorities should ultimately be in a position to deal with it and the necessity for the aid to civil power would no longer exist.

I've got a suggestion for Winston Peters. How about you drop the self-indulgent fights with journalists and the silly comments about Nazi Germany? Instead, why not use the power that the voters have given you to stand up for the ordinary Kiwis who are getting smashed by this government in its relentless pursuit of cuts to pay for unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts? Why not say 'no' to National's tax cut fixation and insist that money is spent where it is needed, instead?

We all know that Christopher 'Seven houses' Luxon, who thinks a trainee cop earns $90,000 a year, is out of touch with ordinary New Zealanders, but Winston Peters has always claimed to represent the Kiwi battler.

Is he really going to stand by while the government hikes car rego fees and hut fees on the Great Walks, reinstates fees on prescriptions, and doubles bus fare for kids? How's that helping the cost of living for ordinary Kiwis?

Even worse is what's happening to disabled people and their whanau. When I wrote before the election that National seemed to have it in for disabled people, some people said I was scaremongering. Well, it doesn't look like scaremongering now, does it? Not when respite and travel funding for disabled people and their carers has been canned, benefit increases have been reduced, and the care workers are still waiting for their pay equity settlement.

These cruel cuts make already difficult lives harder. The Enabling Good Lives principles were meant to let disabled people and their whanau decide for themselves how best to spend their funding to improve their lives. An idea right out of National's Bill English's playbook - people are in the best position to decide how to get best value for money for themselves.

Problem is, this government is putting every cent into tax cuts, so the money's dried up. Now, disabled people are being told they can't spend that money on what they need.

A friend of mine, Rachel, who's in a wheelchair, told me what these cuts mean to her: ""Essentially this means now I can't attend a work conference in Wellington or a tangi up North, because I can't afford to pay personally for support to go. If your wheelchair breaks, you're going to be stuck in bed for two weeks, unable to work. Taking away our freedom to work and parent and stay healthy while threatening and imposing tighter restrictions if we can't work and go on a benefit. It's an absolute disgrace.""

How about it, Winston? How about being the champion of people like Rachel, and ensuring that they have the support they need to live good lives with dignity.

Because, let's be clear: these cuts are not happening out of necessity. The Government has enough money to fund support for disabled people, and decent pay rises for cops, and everything else, if it chooses to.

No, these cuts are happening because this government is prioritising tax cuts above all else. It has committed to the most expensive tax package of all time (not that most of us would even notice the amount we would get). It has a multi-billion gap between its pre-election plan to fund the tax cuts and reality and it is desperately searching for public services to cut to pay for them.

Peters is clearly unhappy with this approach. In the speech that he so completely overshadowed with his Nazis ad-lib, he lambasted neoliberalism, he talked about the importance of not leaving people behind, and he promised that his priority was New Zealand First policies, while implying other parties' policies (ie. the tax cuts) are unaffordable.

OK, then. Time for actions to match the words. Time for Winston Peters and New Zealand First to say: 'no, we won't vote for a Budget that makes the lives of disabled people harder, that cuts the staff that support our Police, that under-invests in schools, that shakes down families through higher fees.'

Time for Peters to use his veto power to insist on a Budget that drops the hyperfixation on pointless tax cuts, freeing up billions of dollars for things that are actually important.

It is not hard to invest in supporting our disabled whanau and in the public services we all rely on in different ways. It is certainly not unaffordable. There's $14b earmarked for tax cuts that can be better spent elsewhere.

It just needs someone with the numbers in Parliament to put the kibosh on the ridiculous tax plan and direct that money where it is needed, instead. Time to step up, Mr Peters.",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,,-0.1529411764705882,448910304,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/WXEB2ZERWVGQ3EJGSY35O5VBU4.png?auth=32abea67f4ecf8fc2b9c438fb639a82e0f59bbc4308440236b3cbfbd17abe91b&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,

Issues concerning these vehicles are not new, and authorities such as local governments (PBT) are frequently tasked with managing them.

There are several processes that must be followed to manage abandoned and derelict vehicles, but the latest initiative by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) through the Road Transport Department (JPJ) for deregistration online via the e-Dereg system is a wise step towards coordinating and expediting the cancellation of registration and disposal of abandoned vehicles.

To revoke the prior car registration, the owner must be physically present at the nearest JPJ branch, pay off any outstanding car loans, and follow the authorities' specified procedures. JPJ's initiative, which involves deregistration of vehicles via digital platform, provides numerous benefits in effectively addressing the problem of abandoned and derelict vehicles.

Vehicle owners can simply access the deregistration process, eliminating the need to visit the nearest JPJ's office. This not only saves time, but also lowers the complications that can arise with conventional methods. The digital technology also enables real-time monitoring of the application status. Vehicle owners can check the progress of their application at any stage, providing them more insight into the process. In addition, the usage of secure digital platforms improves data and information integrity. This method can significantly reduce the risk of misuse or data leakage with conventional methods.

Once the car is deregistered, it can be disposed of through an authorized channel, specifically at an authorized automotive treatment facility (AATF), which facilitates the disposal and recycling of abandoned and derelict vehicles in accordance with the Department of Environment's (DOE) requirements.

Owners can find information on the nearest AATF on the DOE website. Overall, the adoption of digital methods in vehicle disposal provides significant benefits in addressing the problem of abandoned and derelict cars. This project will surely improve the overall efficiency, accessibility, and safety of the process, potentially leading our country to an eco-friendly and sustainable vehicles disposal ecosystem.

The claim has prompted critics to accuse the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which has funded the study by academics at the University of Roehampton, of promoting ""cultural clickbait"".

The project, devoted to ""centring marginalised communities in the contemporary performance of early modern plays"", is due to be completed in two years' time.

The researchers want to challenge the ""normative trend"" in ""classical theatre"" arising from ""the disproportionate representation of William Shakespeare in scholarship and performance"".

In response they are mounting a production of a comedy by Shakespeare's contemporary John Lyly, Galatea, which features characters disguised as the opposite sex. The researchers say the play offers ""an unparalleled affirmative and intersectional demographic, exploring feminist, queer, transgender and migrant lives"".

They say the play ""has almost no stage history since 1588"", adding that ""Diverse Alarums"", the name of the project, ""will transform this state of affairs with a unique combination of methods, ranging across early modern studies, practice-as-research, audience studies, qualitative research, trans, queer and disability studies"".

Writing for the website Before Shakespeare, Andy Kesson, the project's principal investigator, said that ""masculinity and nationalism were crucial motivating factors in the rise of Shakespeare as the arbiter of literary greatness"" and that ""[w]e need to be much, much more suspicious of Shakespeare's place in contemporary theatre"".

'His themes are timeless'

Lionel Shriver, the author, told The Telegraph: ""In Shakespeare's day, half the European population was white and male. They didn't have rainbow flags. Being disabled like Richard III was a matter of character rather than politics, and luckily for them no one had ever coined the linguistic abomination 'cisgender'.

""Still germane because his themes are timeless, Shakespeare will survive even this dogmatic mangling, and his plays will continue to be enjoyed long after today's 'intersectional' performances have foreshortened into a freakish comical footnote in theatrical history.""

Andrew Doyle, the comedian and author, said: ""There's a very good reason why Shakespeare is performed frequently and John Lyly barely at all. Shakespeare was by far the superior playwright. Yet again, ideologues are reducing great art to mere mechanisms for the promotion of an ideology.

""A production of Galatea would be welcome, but given that those behind it are already using anachronistic pseudo-religious terms such as 'cisgender' suggests that it will be a tedious affair. They evidently believe what they are doing is radical, but virtually all theatre companies today are obsessed with identity and gender, and so this is likely to be just more conformist and insipid propaganda.""

Jane Stevenson, the Conservative MP, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ""Theatre does and should entertain, challenge and educate us. I'm all for widening repertoire to bring lesser-known works to audiences, but I'm not sure reducing Galatea to a celebration of all things woke, or knocking Shakespeare for being pale, male and stale is much more than cultural click-bait.

""Shakespeare's works have been translated into 100 languages and clearly still resonate with people all over the world. Love, hate, ambition, loss, jealousy - all universal emotions we all still identify with.""

An Arts and Humanities Research Council spokesman said: ""The Arts and Humanities Research Council invests in a diverse research and innovation portfolio. Decisions to fund the research projects we support are made via a rigorous peer review process by relevant independent experts from across academia and business.""

A spokesman from the University of Roehampton said: ""This project was funded by a national organisation following a rigorous review process. We support academic colleagues to seek external funding to pursue high-quality research in their areas of specialism, which in this case involves national theatre heritage.""",uk.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo News UK,Charlotte Gill,0.1450980392156862,448909429,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AFi4VuYlzXI0xiS.azeODg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTc-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/7081051b70c038c1e83a22c3619862f6,eng-9417852

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

And morale problems within the firefighting force persisted, even as Natural Resources and Forestry Minister (MNRF) Graydon Smith offered financial incentives of up to $5,000 for firefighters who toil on the front lines. Smith, a Parry Sound-area MPP, gave a nod to firefighters, noting ""they work tirelessly under very difficult conditions to protect the health and safety of Ontarians."" ""In addition to (the financial) incentive,"" Smith said, ""we continue to explore longer-term strategies and solutions to support attraction and retention of critical jobs for future years."" The union representing Ontario's fire rangers said it would take the incentives offer, but it also threw cold water on the amount, calling it ""a drop in the bucket"" and a ""Band-Aid response."" The incentives ""will all be lump-sum payments that do not contribute to workers' salaries or pensions,"" the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) said in a separate news release. More than 1,000 wildland fire rangers and aviation crew members are eligible to receive the incentives, the ministry says. Shuniah mayor and Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association president Wendy Landry applauded the ministry's offer, calling it ""a great incentive to have folks apply"" to be fire rangers. ""Northwestern Ontario municipalities and the North as a whole are concerned about the potential of wildfires,"" Landry said on Friday. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union called Smith's announcement a publicity stunt ""more concerned about suppressing criticism than protecting our air quality and human life."" ""The government has ignored wildfire workers' recommendations to fix the (human resources) crisis, and instead, has scrambled to throw scraps at the crisis and the front-line workers who risk their lives,"" the Ontario Public Service Employees Union said in its news release. The new incentives are limited to ""those in certain job classifications"" and followed a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach by the province, the Ontario Public Service Employees Union claimed. In previous years, the province has aimed to hire about 800 fire rangers spread over four-person crews, although that target is not always met. An Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services spokesman said the department has yet to share how many rangers it plans to hire this season, but said recruitment continues. ""As a precaution, MNRF is planning for early spring fires by proactively bringing some fire rangers and support staff back early to address any potential needs arising from spring hazards,"" the spokesman said. Last year's wildfire season in Ontario was one of the worst on record, burning more than 4,400 square kilometres -- three times the 10-year average. Most of the 700 fires occurred in Northern Ontario. Provincial fire rangers, who often work in grim, smoke-filed conditions, have long contended they are under-paid. In the last few years, there have been reports by Ontario Public Service Employees Union members about the province struggling to attract fire rangers and keeping them long enough so that they can gain enough experience to become crew leaders. The starting wage for an Ontario fire ranger is about $25 per hour. Meanwhile, signs of morale problems festered this week at the Aviation Forest Fires and Emergency Services office in Sault Ste. Marie. A management memo calling for ""respect"" was issued to department staff after someone posted a sign in the office's lobby disparaging the department's leaders. ""This is not the first instance where disrespectful communication has been sent to or directed at the AFFES leadership team,"" the memo said.

As Predicted, Trump's 2017 Corporate Tax Cuts Benefited Rich Executives, Not Workers

Let the research show that what so many economic and policy experts warned at the time has now been confirmed. Mar 23, 2024

""A high-stakes tax policy debate will accelerate this year through 2025 over the pending expiration of the individual income and estate tax provisions of the 2017 Trump tax law. Policymakers should use this opportunity to work toward a tax code that raises more revenues, is more progressive and equitable, and supports investments that make the economy work for everyone.

As this debate unfolds, policymakers and the public should understand that the 2017 Trump tax law:

Was skewed to the rich. Households with incomes in the top 1 percent will receive an average tax cut of more than $60,000 in 2025, compared to an average tax cut of less than $500 for households in the bottom 60 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center (TPC).[1] As a share of after-tax income, tax cuts at the top -- for both households in the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent -- are more than triple the total value of the tax cuts received for people with incomes in the bottom 60 percent.[2]

Was expensive and eroded the U.S. revenue base. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in 2018 that the 2017 law would cost $1.9 trillion over ten years,[3] and recent estimates show that making the law's temporary individual income and estate tax cuts permanent would cost another roughly $350 billion a year beginning in 2027.[4] Together with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts enacted under President Bush (most of which were made permanent in 2012), the law has severely eroded our country's revenue base. Revenue as a share of GDP has fallen from about 19.5 percent in the years immediately preceding the Bush tax cuts to just 16.3 percent in the years immediately following the Trump tax cuts, with revenues expected to rise to an annual average of 16.9 percent of GDP in 2018-2026 (excluding pandemic years), according to CBO. This is simply not enough revenue given the nation's investment needs and our commitments to Social Security and health coverage.

Failed to deliver promised economic benefits. Trump Administration officials claimed their centerpiece corporate tax rate cut would ""very conservatively"" lead to a $4,000 boost in household income.[5] New research shows that workers who earned less than about $114,000 on average in 2016 saw ""no change in earnings"" from the corporate tax rate cut, while top executive salaries increased sharply.[6] Similarly, rigorous research concluded that the tax law's 20 percent pass-through deduction, which was skewed in favor of wealthy business owners, has largely failed to trickle down to workers in those companies who aren't owners.[7] Like the Bush tax cuts before it,[8] the 2017 Trump tax cut was a trickle-down failure.

Policymakers should seize the opportunity the 2025 expirations provide and make a course correction in the nation's revenue policies. This would mean reversing the regressive tilt of the 2017 law, raising more revenue, and correcting priorities to advance the interests of low- and moderate-income families across the country instead of those of wealthy shareholders. Several key principles should guide this new course:

Tax cuts for people making over $400,000 should end on schedule. The 2017 law's provisions primarily benefiting high-income households are costly and do not trickle down. They should all end in 2025.

The tax system needs to raise more revenues from wealthy people and profitable corporations to offset any tax cuts extended or expanded for those with incomes below $400,000, to finance high-value investments in people and communities, and to improve our fiscal outlook. President Biden's prior budgets have proposed raising progressive revenue to pay for extensions of provisions affecting households with earnings below $400,000. This should include revisiting the 2017 law's permanent and deeply unpopular corporate tax rate cut and strengthening the law's international corporate tax provisions, which continue to allow significant foreign profit-shifting. New progressive tax policies should also reduce the tax advantages for wealthy people by, for example, curtailing their ability to permanently avoid taxes on their large unrealized capital gains and rolling back the special breaks they receive when they do pay tax. Policymakers can also generate progressive revenues by extending and making permanent the mandatory IRS funding enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, which supports revenues by increasing tax collections primarily from high-income households.

Top priorities for extending and expanding tax provisions in 2025 should be the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for adults not raising children, and the enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace coverage. These credits have a long history of success -- in stark contrast to the record of failure of the corporate tax rate cut and other regressive tax cuts. This includes a marked drop in the child poverty rate in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan's expansion of the Child Tax Credit -- a policy that should be made permanent in 2025. Additionally, some 16 million people who work for low wages and who are not raising children in their homes received help through the Rescue Plan's EITC expansion in 2021, and there were historic gains in the number of people receiving health coverage in the ACA marketplaces during the 2024 open enrollment season, with most enrollees able to find coverage for less than $10 per month. Revenues also can be used for investments outside of the tax code. For example, the costs of child care, home-based care for older adults and people with disabilities, and housing remain unacceptably high for millions of families, and federal investment in these areas falls far short of need.

2017 Trump Tax Law Was Skewed to the Top

Like the Bush tax cuts that came before it,[9] the 2017 tax law benefited high-income households far more than households with low and moderate incomes. Extending the Trump tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 -- namely, the law's individual income and estate tax provisions -- would provide further windfall benefits to high-income households. These cuts would come on top of the large benefits they would continue to receive from the 2017 tax law's permanent provisions.

2017 Law Created New Tax Advantages for Wealthy People and Profitable Corporations

The law will boost the after-tax incomes of households in the top 1 percent by 2.9 percent in 2025, roughly three times the 0.9 percent gain for households in the bottom 60 percent, TPC estimates.[10] The tax cuts that year will average $61,090 for the top 1 percent -- and $252,300 for the top one-tenth of 1 percent. (See Figure 1.) The 2017 law also widens racial disparities in after-tax income.[11]

Circle-level officials of the Revenue wing have started to seize the properties with regard to which the dues of more than one year are pending, causing anxiety among the residents less than two months ahead of parliamentary elections. While officials are mum about the procedure adopted, it has come to light that commercial properties are being targeted in the drive, after issue of notices and warrants.

About 140 properties have been seized across the 30 circles so far, with Jubilee Hills and Yousufguda alone accounting for over 60 seized properties. Already, a one time settlement scheme is on offer for the defaulters, for whom 90% interest waiver will be available if they settle the dues along with 10% interest. Sources informed that the scheme has not evoked much interest, forcing the officials to resort to extreme measures in order to fill the coffers.

While the corporation targets to earn ₹2,100 crore in the current year by way of property tax, the collection is still short of ₹500 crore- ₹600 crore, it is learnt.

The party said Galway City Council could raise €1.7 million in revenue per annum if it were allowed to impose a hotel bedroom levy.

Its Local Election candidate in City Central, Mark Lohan, said it would be a sensible revenue raising measure, with the proceeds earmarked for better services for visitors and locals.

He said a tourist tax was a concept common in Europe and America and could be replicated here.

""It makes sense that a city like Galway examines how this tax would be applied and how it could benefit the city and its residents,"" the former City Councillor said.

The City Council's Corporate Policy Group previously considered the possibility of introducing a 'hotel bed tax' or 'visitor' levy on tourists staying in Galway.

Based on bed-occupancy information provided by Fáilte Ireland, the report said a €2 per room tax would've netted €1.6m in 2017 and 2018.

A room rate with a bed levy of 2% would bring in an estimated income of €1.9m to the Council based on 2018 occupancy.

The report noted that legally local authorities cannot levy bed taxes on visitors.

But at the time the City Council agreed to lobby the Department of Finance to introduce legislation allowing local authorities to levy bed taxes.

The idea had the backing of Fianna Fáil City Councillors

Reigniting the debate this week, Cllr Lohan said: ""On a quick review of my own I estimate that it could raise €1.7 million per year for the city. This is based on a 1% levy on the 3,000 Galway city hotel rooms at €200 per night at 80% occupancy. While this may be the top end of an estimation any revenue that exceeds one million euro per year has to be considered by the City Council.

He pointed out that the recent Commission on Tax and Welfare, which sought to identify how tax systems can support economic activity and promote increased employment and prosperity, recommended the introduction of such an accommodation tax.

""Several European cities already have this system in place including Berlin, Vienna, and Rome where the levy varies from between .40 cent to €2.50 per night. This city-based tax can be ringfenced for more sustainable tourism and ensures that visitors share the responsibility of maintaining and enhancing the city and its amenities. It makes sense for us in Galway to begin the discussion with all stake holders including hotel owners. While there may be initial resistance from them, the benefits in local service improvements may show the cost is worth the benefit,"" said Mr Lohan.",connachttribune.ie,news,Connacht Tribune - Galway City Tribune,Dara Bradley,0.1372549019607843,448908246,1,https://connachttribune.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hotel-room-web.jpg,

Today in the ""I Really Thought I Could Get Away With It"" Department we find a Florida man by the name of Dan Rotta who is now subject to a Criminal Complaint in U.S. v. Rotta, S.D.Fla. Case No. 24-MJ-2479 (March 8, 2024), as stated in the U.S. Department of Justice Press Release (March 11, 2024). My fellow Forbes.com contributor Matthew Roberts explains the technical aspects of the Rotta allegations in his article, DOJ Alleges Decades-Long Tax Scheme To Hide Foreign Assets From IRS (Mar. 12, 2024). Here, I will look at this case from a different angle and try not to repeat Matthew's work as much as possible.

As a preliminary note, at this stage only allegations have been made against Rotta and no judgment has been entered, and he is innocent until proven guilty. All the facts stated below are from the publicly-available but as-yet unproven allegations of the Complaint and accompanying Affidavit of the involved IRS Criminal Investigations agent. To the extent my commentary factually diverges from the Complaint and Affidavit, if at all, they control.

Rotta lived in Fisher Island, Florida, and had been a U.S. citizen and resident since the 1970s, although he held dual citizenships in Romania and Brazil. Starting around 1985, Rotta apparently opened Swiss bank accounts and would maintain these through 2020. These bank accounts were not in Rotta's name but were instead held in the name of various companies. For instance, Rotta opened an account with Credit Suisse (which would later cooperate and turn over account information to the IRS) under the name of Vima, Inc., a Liberian corporation whose shares were held by NAD Foundation, a Liechtenstein foundation was that formed for Rotta's benefit. The IRS-CI agent who wrote the Affidavit noted that NAD is ""Dan"" spelled backwards, and ""Vima"" was a combination of the first two letters of the names of Rotta's two children then living.

Later, in 1997, Rotta opened two accounts with Bank Julius Baer in Switzerland and identified himself as the beneficial owner of the accounts, over which Rotta also had signatory authority. In 2000, Rotta used $2 million from this account to purchase a home on Fisher Island.

Note here that there are no allegations of wrongdoing by the banks involved in this case.

In January, 2001, Switzerland mandated new bank requirements for identifying U.S. account holders. Shortly thereafter, Rotta closed his accounts with Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer and transferred the funds to a company called Citaro International Business Corporation, Ltd., whose accounts were also held at the same two banks, plus UBS. Citaro was a bearer-share corporation formed in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which means that there is no share ledger to record who owns the shares, but very simply whoever physically holds (""bears"") the shares controls those shares.

Rotta executed an agreement with Sinco Trust Ltd. which identified himself as the beneficial owner of the accounts and authorized a person by the name of Beda Singenberger to manage the assets in the Citaro accounts. Later, in 2011, Singenberger would be indicted by a New York federal grand jury for conspiracy to defraud the United States by helping U.S. persons evade Swiss bank identify verification requirements so that those persons could conceal their offshore accounts and income in those accounts. Singenberger is still a fugitive from U.S. justice.

By 2001, Rotta had over $19 million in various Citaro accounts at Credit Suisse, Bank Julius Baer, and UBS which generated around $400,000 in investment income for 2001 and $1.375 million in 2003, all of which Rotta used to fund his Florida lifestyle by causing Citaro to send money to his domestic accounts.

Keeping the shell game going, in 2003 Rotta closed the Citaro accounts and transferred that company's assets to new accounts at the same three bank in the name of Sky Delta Limited, which was formed in Hong Kong. Like Citaro, Sky Delta was owned by the NAD Foundation with Rotta identified as the beneficial owner. Between 2003 and 2008, the Sky Delta accounts varied from $15 million to $20 million and produced income ranging between $1.3 million and $1.6 million.

Rotta caused Sky Delta to transfer money to his domestic company, Pevima Corporation, which paid his bills, to his life insurance policy, or sometimes just directly to his own accounts. Pevima had no real business purpose, but instead was just a domestic entity through which Rotta used to receive his offshore funds as they were remitted to him.

In May of 2008, dark clouds started to form in the offshore world as UBS came under a criminal investigation. Rotta clipped a Wall Street Journal story about this and kept it at his house (and which evidence was later found in the inevitable IRS raid). This apparently spooked Rotta, as he soon closed Sky Delta's accounts at UBS and transferred the money instead to a new Swiss bank (which is simply identified as ""Swiss Bank 1"" in the criminal complaint). This bank recorded that Rotta was the beneficial owner of the new Sky Delta account and identified himself not as a U.S. person but instead as a Brazilian citizen living in Brazil.

The next year, in February of 2009, UBS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. in which the bank admitted that it had conspired to help U.S. persons commit tax evasion. As part of this agreement, UBS agreed to immediately provide the IRS with the identities of its U.S. customers. Rotta also saved these articles which were later seized at his Florida home.

Swiss Bank 1 had an affiliated trust company, and now Rotta used the Swiss trust company to create a new entity structure. Rotta directed that Sky Delta transfer its accounts from Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer (which accounts were then closed) to Swiss Bank 1. Rotta again held himself out as a Brazilian citizen and resident and signed false attestations that he was not a U.S. citizen, nor was he subject to U.S. income tax withholding requirements.

The new accounts with Swiss Bank 1 were held in the name of Edelwiss Corporate Limited which were managed by the Swiss trust company. Edelwiss was another BVI corporation, but now its shares were held by the Putzo Foundation, which was a new Liechtenstein foundation for Rotta's benefit. Between 2009 and 2011, Edelwiss had between $15 million and $20 million in its accounts, which produced from $1.6 million to $2 million annually. The aforementioned Swiss Trust Company managed the Edelwiss accounts. While Rotta did not have signatory authority over the accounts, he nonetheless communicated to the Swiss Trust Company at least once about the disbursement of assets to him, and his disbursements from Edelwiss to Rotta's domestic accounts were in the millions.

Then one day the IRS came knocking.

In July of 2011, the IRS began an audit of Rotta's half-brother based on information that the IRS had obtained through the UBS deferred prosecution agreement about the Vima account. Rotta's half-brother denied owning Vima or any other offshore entities or accounts. Somehow this all lead to Rotta himself, and in September of 2011 the IRS referred Rotta himself for audit of Vima and the UBS accounts.

This was not good, to put it mildly, and Rotta started taking steps to erase any evidence of his ownership of the Edelwiss accounts. Next, Rotta obtained the agreement of his cousin in Brazil, and a true Brazilian citizen, to serve as the nominee owner of Edelwiss, since Rotta's cousin would not be subject to any U.S. withholding or tax reporting requirements. Then, in October and November of 2011, Rotta worked with the Swiss Trust Company to make sure that the paperwork for Edelwiss reflected that Rotta's cousin was the beneficial owner of the Edelwiss accounts. This included Rotta's cousin to create a new Liechtenstein trust, called the Putzo Settlement, to hold the shares for the benefit of Rotta and his family. Rotta was named the protector of Putzo Settlement, which effectively gave him veto powers over that new trust. Rotta's cousin -- referred to as ""Co-Conspirator 1"" in the criminal complaint -- was recorded as the beneficial owner for Edelwiss by both Credit Suisse and yet another Swiss bank (referred to as ""Swiss Bank 1"").

Even with the IRS launching its formal investigation of Rotta's activities, and Rotta taking great pains to distance himself from Edelwiss, he just could not stop having Edelwiss continue to pay money to Rotta's domestic company, Pevima, apparently for his living expenses. These included two transfers of $301,000 and $300,000 from Edelwiss to Pevima on January 30 and May 21, 2012, respectively.

As the IRS audit rolled on, an IRS agent spoke with Rotta and his tax preparer (called Accountant 1) regarding Rotta's income taxes for 2008 through 2011. In these conversations, Rotta denied that he had any foreign bank accounts, foreign investments or business activity. This was in December of 2011. The following May, now 2012, Rotta again repeated his denials of any offshore accounts, though for the first time he stated that he owned a candy company in Brazil and a watch business in Hong Kong during the 1990s.

Feeling the heat, in October of 2012, Rotta hired counsel (Attorney 1) to represent him during the IRS audit, apparently replacing Accountant 1. Rotta told Attorney 1 that he did not have any foreign bank accounts, and Attorney 1 told this to the IRS Revenue Agent. In a later meeting in November of that year with the IRS Revenue Agent, Rotta in person again denied having any foreign bank account. At this time, Rotta also told the IRS Revenue Agent that he had no safe deposits during the years in question. This was false since Rotta had a safe deposit box for the Sky Delta account for UBS in 2008. Rotta also had a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse in his own name from 2009 to 2014.

The IRS agent suspected all this was false and had at least some information at this time to prove it. Finally, in November of 2012, the IRS agent confronted Rotta with the transfers of several hundred thousand dollars from Rotta's offshore accounts to his domestic accounts. The IRS agent also told Rotta that she knew that Rotta had received $1.45 million from Rotta's Sky Delta accounts, and asked Rotta to explain the source of the funds. Rotta said it was all a loan from Sky Delta, and that he had arranged the borrowing from two friends who were not U.S. persons that actually owned and controlled Sky Delta, and not Rotta himself.

Rotta, through Attorney 1, later submitted various documents to the IRS agent showing that he did not own Sky Delta, but rather two friends who were Romanian nationals living in France owned Sky Delta and made the loan. These documents included a promissory note for the loan, a letter from another attorney (Attorney 2), a letter from the son-in-law (Co-Conspirator 2) of the Romanian nationals, and a letter from his aforementioned cousin.

That was Rotta's story about the $1.45 million, but the IRS agent then started asking questions about additional transfers that Rotta received from Sky Delta in the amount of $850,000 and also from Edelwiss for a little over $2.8 million for 2009 to 2011. Responding to the IRS agent, Attorney 1 presented additional promissory notes and letters from Rotta's cousin and the son-in-law of the Romanian nationals.

In August of 2013, Attorney 1 on behalf of Rotta again advised the IRS agent by letter that Rotta had never heard of Vima, never had any interest in a Liberian corporation (again meaning Vima), and never had any account at UBS. Attorney 1's law firm repeated much of this to the IRS agent in yet another letter in November of that same year. This November letter was in response to the IRS agent's request for documents, wherein Rotta's attorney denied that he had any such documents.

To skip ahead, the later raid on Rotta's home would prove otherwise. Rotta had kept ""extensive records"" of his offshore companies and accounts, including Rotta's own instructions to UBS to form Vima, make Rotta the director and president of Vima, and a form given to UBS which documented Rotta's beneficial ownership of Vima's assets. Rotta's records included documents showing that he was the owner of Sky Delta and controlled its various Swiss bank accounts.

Returning to the IRS audit, the IRS issued Rotta a Notice of Deficiency for the tax years 2008 to 2010, which found that Rotta had understated his income by $6,148,993 for those three years (through Sky Delta and Edelwiss) and which included the purported loans of his French friends as instead being Rotta's income.

And now it gets interesting with the entry onto the stage of Attorney 3, a new attorney hired by Rotta to file a Tax Court petition on his behalf, aided by Rotta's trusts and estate planning attorney, known as Attorney 4. Through the Tax Court petition, Rotta reiterated that he did not have any foreign bank accounts and all the money that he received from Sky Delta and Edelwiss was not income but loans. Those promissory notes for Rotta to Sky Delta and Edelwiss, which purported to document the loans, were attached to the petition. But now Rotta also claimed that the funds that he obtained from Edelwiss in 2009 and 2010 were loans from his Brazilian cousin.

While the IRS audit was ongoing, Rotta still needed funds to live on and thus a shuffling of money from his offshore accounts began. Instead of receiving money directly into his own accounts as he had previously, Rotta now started directing that the funds be sent to other persons, such as his cousin. Yet another lawyer who was a longtime friend of Rotta, we're up to Attorney 5, worked with Rotta's cousin to open a domestic Citibank account on which Attorney 5 had signatory authority. In fact, Attorney 5 was simply Rotta's nominee, and Rotta had online access to the Citibank account, knew the debit card numbers and security codes, and the like. From 2012 to 2016, this Citibank account received over $3.7 million from the Edelwiss accounts, which were then diverted either directly to Rotta's personal accounts or were used to pay Rotta's bills. Attorney 5 accepted Rotta's instructions to make transfers from the Citibank account for Rotta's benefit.

In addition to the Citibank account, Rotta also caused Edelwiss to transfer moneys through the attorney trust accounts of Attorneys 2 and 5. Between 2014 and 2016, Rotta directed seven wire transfers totaling $614,500 to be sent to Attorney 2's trust account from Edelwiss. In July, 2016, Rotta caused Edelwiss to send $75,000 to Attorney 2's trust account, which Attorney 2 then further transferred to a Miami car dealership so that Rotta could purchase a new Porsche 911 Targa.

Enter now Attorney 7 in June of 2015, who began to represent Rotta in the Tax Court litigation and ongoing IRS audits for the years 2011 through 2013. Attorney 7 sent the IRS declarations from Rotta's cousin and Co-Conspirator 2 which stated that the payments to Rotta from Edelwiss were loans. Later, in 2016, Rotta's cousin and Co-Conspirator 2 told an IRS attorney during an interview that the payments to Rotta from Sky Delta and Edelwiss were loans which Rotta was expected to repay.

In December f 2016, Rotta sold his property in Oyster Bay, New York, which had purportedly been pledged as security for the Sky Delta and Edelwiss loans. Instead of paying Sky Delta and Edelwiss back, however, Rotta deposited the $5.9 million proceeds of the sale into his personal bank account. A month later, in January of 2017, Rotta transferred $4.4 million to his cousin and another $750,000 to Co-Conspirator 2 with memo lines of these checks stating, ""payment of loan as per agreement."" These checks were then provided by Attorney 7 to the IRS as proof of the loan repayment.

Based upon the representations of Rotta's cousin and Co-Conspirator 2, the Tax Court litigation was settled in February of 2017, and included that Rotta would pay not additional income tax or penalties for the years 2008 through 2010. Based on these same representations, the following month the IRS also agreed to an identical settlement for tax years 2011 through 2013.

But remember those loans repayments made by Rotta? Turns out that after Rotta settled with the IRS, those funds were almost immediately sent back to Rotta via a trust for the benefit of Rotta and his son called the Sergio 2014 Trust.

Rotta's trusts and estates planner, Attorney 5, In October of 2015, assisted Rotta's cousin in settling the Majestic Trust, in which Rotta and his son were entitled to the net income of the trust. In November of 2016, Rotta began closing the Edelwiss accounts and transferred those funds to a bank in Zurich known as Swiss Bank 2. Those new accounts had been opened by Attorney 5 and a declaration of trust given to the Swiss Bank 2 indicated that Rotta's cousin had settled the Majestic Trust for the benefit of Rotta and his son. Forms also given to the bank identified Rotta and his son as U.S. citizens.

The reality here was that Rotta's cousin did not really settle the Majestic Trust, but instead Rotta himself effectively settled it by transferring his funds in Edelwiss to the Majestic Trust (a trust settlor is one who funds the trust). Next, to further reduce his one income taxes, Rotta claimed that a portion of the income of the Majestic Trust went to Rotta's cousin. Although Rotta attempted to distance himself from the Majestic Trust, he effectively managed the assets in that trust through Attorney 5.

Meanwhile, Rotta kept transferring money from Switzerland to his domestic accounts, usually through the personal accounts of Rotta's cousin and with the assistance of Attorney 5. January of 2019 saw $600,000 transferred to Rotta's cousin's Citibank account, followed by another $650,000 in February. Of these funds, over $1 million was transferred to Attorney 5's client trust account where it was held in trust for Rotta. In June of 2019, Rotta instructed Attorney 5 by e-mail to cause $490,000 to be transferred from Rotta's Swiss Bank 2 account to the Majestic Trust's Morgan Stanley account. That same year, Rotta instructed Attorney 5 to close the Swiss Bank 2 account and transfer the balance to the same Morgan Stanley account.

By 2019, Rotta knew that certain of his Swiss bank accounts were going to be disclosed to the IRS as part of the Swiss banks' agreement with the IRS, and that these disclosures would finally make clear that Rotta and his cousin had defrauded the IRS during the earlier audits. So, enter yet another attorney (this one not given a number for whatever reason) that Rotta hired to make a voluntary disclosure to the IRS. To qualify for a voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer had to fully come clean about the taxpayer's activity and make a ""timely, accurate, and complete voluntary disclosure of their conduct."" The voluntary disclosure also does not work if the IRS had previously received information about the unreported account.

Rotta submitted a voluntary disclosure application wherein he disclosed the Edelwiss account but claimed that only $2 million of the account assets were his. The IRS let Rotta into the voluntary disclosure program, but this was only the start of the procedure. In the next round of disclosures, Rotta checked ""no"" in response to the question whether he was aware that any foreign government or financial institution had advised him that his account information was susceptible to being turned over to the IRS. In fact, Swiss Bank 1 had previously notified Rotta that it had received a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for the Edelwiss records.

Rotta also admitted -- for the first time -- that he had had owned and controlled Swiss bank accounts since the 1990s. However, Rotta also claimed that most of the assets in those accounts had come to him by way of inheritance from his cousin's father, except for $2 million which he claimed to have inherited from his (Rotta's) first wife's father. In actuality, Rotta had owned and controlled the Edelwiss accounts since at least 1985.

And now it gets weird. When asked why Rotta's cousin had placed funds in trust for the benefit of Rotta and his son, Rotta stated that his cousin had done this because his cousin had no children of his own and wanted the funds to pass to Rotta's son. In fact, Rotta's cousin had a wife and two adult children of his own.

And even weirder. Rotta now claimed in his Voluntary Disclosure Application that ""he had tried to become complaint with U.S. tax and reporting obligations but asserted that he was never properly advised as to how to accomplish this."" Rotta also pointed to the fact that his IRS audits and Tax Court litigation did not result in any back taxes or penalties, overlooking that those results had been procured by his own numerous false representations.

Thus, the IRS-CI's agent concluded that, based on all the foregoing, Rotta had conspired with his cousin and others to evade taxes, and also made materially false statements and disclosures to the IRS in violation of the U.S. penal code.

ANALYSIS

Again, these are mere allegations against Rotta, so far unproven in any court of law, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty after a fair trial. But my analysis isn't going to be about Rotta. Instead, let's look at the activities of all the other folks who assisted him.

Nobody but Rotta is listed in this particular criminal complaint, but that doesn't mean that Rotta was the only one who potentially committed crimes. One would naturally presume that Rotta's cousin will face allegations of criminal conspiracy, albeit he apparently lives in Brazil and one would further wonder whether he would be subject to extradition to the United States. Then there is Swiss trustee Beda Singenberger who already has been indicted, albeit for things other than this, who is already a fugitive from justice. After those two, we have numerous Swiss bankers and others abroad who also potentially engaged in criminal conduct by assisting Rotta, but again they may be difficult to get at so long as they stay away from North America.

The most interesting question is whether some of the attorneys who knowingly assisted Rotta in criminal conduct (if he engaged in that) are potential targets of criminal allegations. Here, I don't mean those attorneys who did little more than represent Rotta, but instead the focus is on those attorneys -- and particularly Attorney 5 -- who allowed Rotta to transfer money through their attorney trust accounts. If Rotta did engage in criminal conduct in regard to those funds, then what those attorneys did would be pretty blatant money laundering. Not only does a conviction for money laundering carry heavy penalties, such as five years per count, but it would of course result in the disbarment of any attorney convicted of such activity. Just last month, I wrote another article about an attorney who inadvisedly took in $11 million from a client's investment scheme, and after his client was prosecuted then so was the attorney (who later plead guilty to the removal of property to avoid seizure).

If the allegations here are to be believed, then Attorney 5 did much more than simply launder money through his client trust account. Attorney 5 also actively aided and abetted Rotta's actions and basically served as his nominee. So in addition to money laundering charges, there would also be charges of criminal conspiracy and aiding and abetting tax evasion. In fact, the allegations here are so egregious that it is difficult to see how Attorney 5 could not be prosecuted.

When prosecutors pursue a conspiracy case, they usually start at the outside with bit players, get them to cooperate, and then work their way inwards towards the bigger fish. But if prosecutors have a solid case against the biggest fish, then sometimes prosecutors will start at the center with the biggest fish and then their way out and snab persons for less egregious, albeit still criminal, conduct. The bottom line is that this case may only be the first of several.

Finally, I will reiterate a point that I have previously written about numerous times about hiding money in undisclosed offshore accounts: Somebody knows. When somebody tries to set up a structure to hide money abroad, they necessarily require the services of trust companies, banks, and usually often investment managers. Even if the IRS doesn't know about the offshore accounts, these people know. When people initially move money offshore, they get a good song and dance about the local country's strict financial privacy laws, etc., but as with Switzerland those laws can change and the service providers may someday be compelled under the new laws to cough up evidence about their clients. There have also been numerous cases where some of these offshore service providers basically embezzled money from their clients and then threatened to turn them into the client's home nation tax authorities if they complained (much like how the Mafia used to shake down bookies once upon a time). And all that is on top of bank employees obtaining supposedly secret client information and later selling it to the tax authorities as whistleblowers such as how Bradley Birkenfeld came into an award of $104 million for his disclosures about UBS and its clients which lead to that bank's deferred prosecution agreement and enormous fine.

It's just a very bad gamble that the secrecy of accounts will be maintained over a long period of years, and of course if somebody is caught evading taxes then the penalties, both monetary and penal, are tremendous. Some folks like to think that they are being smart in hiding their money abroad, but the truth is that it is really a very stupid thing to do.

Somebody knows.

It's not just the headcount at Google that's getting smaller.

Like other Silicon Valley giants retrenching amid financial uncertainty, Google has cut thousands of jobs since January 2023. But the company is also accelerating changes within its lavish corporate cafeterias -- a longtime lure for tech employees -- that will both reduce costs and cut the company's food waste.

From offering smaller milk containers to cooking eggs on the spot instead of in advance, Google has found ways to put less food in the trash while trying to make sure employees don't feel cheated out of one of the company's most beloved perks.

Google's food waste goals are set on a 2025 timeline, which is tighter than the 2030 deadlines tied to many of its other sustainability efforts. The company said in March 2022 that it aimed to cut waste per employee by half and send zero food waste to landfills by 2025. By the end of 2022, it had already diverted 85 percent of waste. ""The near-term nature of it makes it challenging,"" said Kate Brandt, Google's chief sustainability officer. The company hasn't released more recent numbers but Brandt said they are ""seeing good progress.""

Serving more than 240,000 meals a day, the 386 cafes that make up Google's global foodservice operations outnumber the world's approximately 360 Cheesecake Factory Inc. locations. Google also operates more than 1,500 microkitchens and 49 food trucks for employees. At this scale, the tech giant is essentially running a restaurant company. That means its experiments offer clues for how other foodservice companies could approach efforts to trim carbon footprints or slash costs.

Indeed, the just-in-time eggs, which cut Google's scrambled egg waste by 44 percent in its Bay Area kitchens, have already made their way elsewhere. Compass Group, the foodservice provider that worked with Google on the change, has implemented it at hundreds of additional locations.

That's just one example of ongoing tweaks. ""Literally thousands of things have changed,"" said Andrew Shakman, chief executive officer of Leanpath, a technology firm that offers automated food-waste tracking and has been working with Google since 2014.

Food waste has been a focal point in Google's sustainability efforts because it is a major contributor to global emissions: By some estimates, it's responsible for about eight percent of all human-caused greenhouse gases.

In an internal memo last year reported by Business Insider, the company directly linked the environmental and financial benefits of initiatives like closing underused microkitchens and cafes as hybrid schedules reduce foot traffic.

The efforts go beyond closures, though. Google's kitchens now use leftovers to create new dishes, including making Mediterranean chickpea sliders out of unused salad bar items. They source ingredients like ugly produce that would otherwise go to waste. When a fresh juicer was creating excess peel waste in the Dublin office, a brewery nearby used it to make citrus beer. Surplus edible food gets donated, not trashed.

But the company also has to be careful not to look like a cheapskate in front of its long-spoiled employees. Pre-plated meals might provide smaller-than-preferred portions. A sign asking employees to take only what they can eat and come back for seconds may strike some as unnecessarily paternalistic.

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., declined to say how much money is being saved through its efforts, but food-waste reduction advocates are broadly approving. ""Whether they're primarily motivated by environmental benefit or cost savings is frankly irrelevant if they achieve both ends,"" said Danielle Vogel, professor of management at American University's Kogod School of Business and the former owner of a climate-conscious grocery store in Washington, DC. ""Mitigating food waste is good for the balance sheet so everybody wins.""

Still, it's hard to assess environmental impact of the efforts. The company does not break out its food-specific emissions in its carbon footprint and declined to provide numbers Bloomberg Green requested.

""If they want to make bold claims about sustainability and achievements, unless you can prove it in hardcore numbers, then it's very soft and airy fairy,"" said Chris Hocknell, a director at sustainability consultancy Eight Versa. ""When you're Google, you've got to be better than class.""",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,consent,-0.2392156862745098,448907728,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/23/id5613650-FOOD-GOOGLE-WASTE-GET-1080x720.jpeg,

Islamabad: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recommended reinstating an 18 per cent general sales tax (GST) on petrol during the ongoing discussions with the government for the release of the last tranche of its bailout package, The Express Tribune reported on Saturday.

The IMF has proposed increasing the levy on petrol by Pakistani currency (PKR) 60 and reinstating the 18 per cent GST previously abolished in March 2022.

The amount of federal excise duty on petroleum products in the fiscal year 2023 was 0.7 per cent of the GDP, while for other items, it was 0.4 per cent of the GDP, mainly obtained from the federal excise duty on cigarettes.

The Petroleum Development Levy has undergone several changes in recent years, but there was a significant increase in it in fiscal year 2023.

It has been proposed to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in the country, such as yachts, while enhancing border control. This is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of petroleum byproducts from sensitive areas in particular.

According to reports, an increase in federal excise duty (FED) at a uniform rate on domestically manufactured cigarettes has been recommended by the IMF. There is also a proposal to apply the same tax rate to imported cigarettes as local cigarettes.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that the financially beleaguered nation needed another long-term bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise its fragile economy, ARY News reported.

""A new tranche of loan is likely to be received from the IMF in a few days, however, we would need another programme,"" he said while addressing the session of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) apex committee attended by civil-military leadership.

The comments came a day after the IMF agreed to a staff-level agreement with Islamabad which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion under an existing USD 3 billion standby arrangement.

He said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the review for issuance of the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion which hopefully be received by next month.

""We will succeed gradually in breaking the begging bowl and coming out of the debt trap with the reforms,"" PM Sharif said.

He also sought the support of all political parties and the provincial governments to successfully implement the agenda of macroeconomic stability in the country, ARY News reported.

Notably, the IMF mission that visited Islamabad for five days on the last review of the stand-by programme said Pakistani authorities expressed interest in yet another bailout.

The stand-by arrangement expires on April 11.

A woman indicted for her role in a scheme to file false tax returns and then use Hawaii businesses, banks and trusts to launder the refunds entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and pleaded guilty Wednesday.

Sook Young Jung, a former Honolulu resident, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by fraudulently obtaining a tax refund and then thwarting efforts to recoup it, according to a Justice Department news release from Washington, D.C.

Jung was the sixth person charged in connection with the investigation. The case was one of at least three tax-fraud indictments in 2021 that listed ""co-conspirator 1 "" as the owner of the Gimmel Group LLC, a domestic limited-liability company in Hawaii that ""purported to be a personal investment business, "" according to the 15-count indictment handed down July 15, 2021, and unsealed Sept. 9, 2021.

Jung conspired ""with others to file a false 2015 individual income tax return in her name.""

Jung's co-conspirators created a fake tax form purportedly issued by a mortgage lender to Jung, which Jung attached to her return, that ""falsely reported that Jung withheld over $1.7 million in taxes."" As a result of this ""fraudulent submission, "" the IRS issued Jung a refund of $1, 147, 036.

Jung allegedly conspired with the Gimmel Group's owner and a signatory of Mortgage Compliance Advisors &Solutions LLC, a Florida company, by recruiting at least five other people to file false tax returns to obtain refunds they did not deserve.

The five are listed only by their initials in the indictment : C.H., B.K.K., C.S.W., S.S.L. and J.H.

From 2015 to 2019, Jung, an accomplice and the owner of Gimmel Group allegedly used MCA &S to act as their recruits' mortgage lender to help fill out IRS Form 1099-MISC and Form 1040 to claim fake, sizable tax withholdings.

The conspirators allegedly filed a false 2014 amended individual income tax return that claimed a refund of $464, 904 and a false 2015 individual income tax return that claimed a refund of $1, 134, 902, according to DOJ.

Jung and others paid the owner of the Gimmel Group ""substantial fees "" based in part on a percentage of tax refunds received and the amount of work done to facilitate false returns, according to the indictment. The pair created fake trusts and opened bank accounts in the name of the trusts to conceal the proceeds and prevent the IRS from recovering the money.

Jung and an accomplice also cut cashier's checks from the accounts to pay alleged co-conspirators, according to federal court documents.

After filing the false tax return and submitting the fake tax form, Jung took ""steps to try and ensure that the IRS could not recover the fraudulently obtained refund, "" according to the Justice Department.

On one occasion, Jung deposited the refund check into a newly opened bank account and immediately withdrew most of the funds in cashier's checks. She also paid, through nominees, one of her co-conspirators ""$500, 000 for the co-conspirator's assistance in obtaining the fraudulent refund.""

Jung is scheduled to be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, a period of supervised release, restitution and a fine.

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department's Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Clare E. Connors for the District of Hawaii made the announcement.

The prosecution was the result of an ongoing investigation by the IRS Criminal Investigation, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

It's time to bite the bullet and put tax cuts on hold until we can afford them.

Even if it finds the money - digging down the back of the sofa for disability allowances and under the car seat for police funding - it is madness to pour cash back into the public's pocket until inflation is beaten and interest rates are on their way down.

Tax cuts are stimulatory - which means, in terms of the fiscal impulse, the Government will be pushing back against its own austerity measures.

To put it another way, the Government is hitting the fiscal brakes with one foot at the same time as putting the other on the accelerator.

Arguments from the Prime Minister and Finance Minister, that cuts to government spending will offset the stimulus, are circular. They are an admission that tax cuts will water down the disinflationary benefits of all the spending cuts.

Fiscally neutral (as the IMF this week warned that cuts will need to be) isn't actually good enough.

The point of budget cuts should be to remove unproductive stimulus from the economy, reduce inflation and help the Reserve Bank to get interest rates down faster.

There is no way pouring billions of dollars back into public pockets this year won't make the Reserve Bank's job harder.

""The planned personal income tax relief is targeted predominantly at low and middle-income earners and families with children, which have a higher propensity to spend,"" the IMF said in its report on New Zealand's economy.

The merits of austerity as an economic policy are always controversial, to say the least. Critics of austerity are quite right: cutting spending in a recession does make things worse.

But as ANZ economist Miles Workman has pointed out: ""This isn't your run-of-the-mill, run-for-the-hills recession that we've seen through times of financial market and economic crisis. Rather, it's a policy-induced slowdown that's part of the necessary transition from too much fiscal and monetary stimulus in the wake of the pandemic.""

Apart from inflation-busting, the other good reason for tightening up government spending is basic fiscal prudence. We need to narrow the deficit and get the Crown accounts back into the kind of shape that could withstand another external shock - when it inevitably arrives.

The tax cuts make that so much harder too.

Perhaps National is wedded to tax cuts for ideological reasons. It might be clinging to the contentious ""trickle-down economics"" idea that lower taxes drive greater productivity, which will eventually boost Crown revenue with more economic growth.

But if that were the case, these cuts shouldn't be targeted at landlords and low to middle-income earners. There should be tax breaks for R&D investment, tech start-ups and investment in the productive end of the economy.

National projected the cuts to cost almost $15 billion across the next four years - that's before you throw in $2.8b it will cost to give landlords back their tax breaks.

That kind of money makes a huge difference to social spending but is not enough to deliver any rapid productivity gains.

Instead, National risks burning its political capital with miserly budget calls.

I am aware that there is nuance to issues such as the disability allowance cuts and that they won't now be as severe as headlines first suggested.

Some have described that as a backdown.

The current Government policy seems to be: cut first and then walk back anything that creates too much negative publicity. In the corporate world, this is a strategy known as ""move fast and break things"". It was the motto at Facebook for many years, back when ""disruption"" was also a big buzzword.

If you want to effect rapid change in your organisation, don't sort out all the details first. Make the big radical calls and then let your staff resolve any issues it creates afterwards.

I have some sympathy for this approach because Labour took too long to resolve details and ended up failing to deliver the big change it promised.

But from a political point of view, trying to defend funding cuts for an autistic girl's swimming lessons is a terrible starting point for a debate.

Big staffing cuts for the police and Ministries of Health and Primary Industries also appear to go well beyond notions of ""woke and wasteful bureaucracy"" that were touted on the campaign trail.

Obviously, cutting spending and taxes were both central planks of National's election policies. They need to follow through on those promises.

When you consider the inflation we've all just lived through, there is an element of fairness to adjusting the tax brackets.

But it makes sense to take a breath. Focus on the immediate task at hand: fiscal responsibility. Help the RBNZ get inflation under control and interest rates back down.

A delay until July next year would give the Government an extra $4b of breathing room to get its cost-cutting back into the realms of the prudent and sensible, rather than looking cruel and miserly.

It seems unlikely the voting public would punish National for the delay in 2026. If anything, the cuts will be fresher in the public consciousness and, hopefully, the economy will be back in a much better balance.",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,"Liam Dann, opinion, can, them",-0.2313725490196078,448906903,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/EUPF3TCKDZDFJAZRMZXOCNHL24.jpg?auth=a1c7e06ffc722d0b14041a4c8115ca5983ada8c95e34ef5bec91cdb45e00e828&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,

Kiwi investors have been trained to worry endlessly about how much they're paying in KiwiSaver fees.

However, one Kiwisaver provider argues that tax is another fee and that most people are paying too much, impacting their returns.

Savers pay tax at their own personal Prescribed Investor Rate [PIR] on their KiwiSaver. However many KiwiSaver providers have third-party international investments under the bonnet, which pay another layer of tax that few investors know about or see, says Kernel KiwiSaver's founder Dean Anderson.

How it works is KiwiSaver providers often invest some of their savers' money in third party funds to ensure they have a wide range of investments in different markets. However, if those funds are domiciled [based] offshore, they're paying tax to overseas governments that can't be clawed back as credits and is lost.

""It's quite simple. As long as the local [KiwiSaver or other] fund here owns Nestle in Europe [for example], that's fine,"" says Anderson. ""But if the local [KiwiSaver or other managed] fund owns a fund in Australia that then owns Nestle It has an extra step and you can't get the tax back. That's where the leakage comes in.""

In that scenario, KiwiSaver providers end up paying tax here on income that has already been taxed overseas. That double taxation can drain 0.25 per cent to 0.9 per cent of returns, says Anderson. ""So quite a large impact on returns. All of those little fractions add up."" The numbers aren't that different from some KiwiSaver management fees.

A cynic would say that Kernel, which owns the underlying investments in its funds, has a barrow to push. But for the record I approached Anderson on the subject, not vice versa. A line about ""tax leakage"" in a Kernel newsletter had caught my eye. The idea of additional layers of tax and fees in KiwiSaver sub funds has always bothered me and the word ""leakage"" was a pithy way to put it.

Tax is an increasingly big question for investors thanks to rising personal and trust tax rates, says Anderson. It's not just KiwiSaver.

Thanks to the top personal tax rate being raised to 39 per cent in 2022, clients were looking to move some of their other investments to Pie funds. The top tax rate for a Pie fund such as KiwiSaver is 28 per cent, which was significantly less than 39 per cent for tap rate taxpayers on non-Pie investments.

Clients are becoming more interested in the total cost of investing, says Anderson. Tax is part of the ""everything else"" over and above management fees that investors should think about, he says. ""Treat it in the same way [you do] management fees. Tax is just another fee you should also look at and ultimately try to minimise.""

I spoke with Simplicity KiwiSaver founder Sam Stubbs. In April last year the KiwiSaver provider switched from holding Vanguard funds for overseas exposure to remove the tax leakage.

""It ends up making our members, somewhere in the range of 30 to 70 basis points extra a year in terms of returns,"" says Stubbs. The move was a reluctant one because Vanguard wouldn't provide Simplicity with locally domiciled funds to invest in. ""Unfortunately it's the curse of the small market. New Zealand is too small a market for them. So we made our own [international] funds and outsourced them to DWS to manage.""

Just as with fees, layers of extra tax don't always translate into a poor return. Sometimes high-fee funds have better returns than low-fee funds. Likewise a KiwiSaver fund paying higher tax under the bonnet, isn't necessarily the one with the poorest return. It's all part of the mix, however, says Katrina Scorrar, senior tax associate at Johnston Associates.

Neither Kernel, nor Simplicity had the highest annual return over five years in their respective KiwiSaver categories when I compared returns from FundSource and Morningstar.

Having the highest return, lowest fees or tax isn't necessarily the most important factor for everyone. Personally I try to choose funds that are more likely to be ethical, and less likely to greenwash. Readers can compare KiwiSaver funds on grounds such as these at MindfulMoney.net.

Scorrar says the tax leakage issue is one that people need to bear in mind as they do fees or returns. ""It's another piece to the puzzle of how much you're actually going to get back from your investment. Because of all the other factors that you have involved, it is hard to isolate tax by itself.""",nzherald.co.nz,news,NZ Herald,"Diana Clement, opinion, too, are",-0.03529411764705881,448906900,1,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/LCCNUPA65VC2BMGCN6FVUQVTZI.jpg?auth=c067bd20fd23063c2340958e9a4805bd91d9b2b94167eb46dcea87c6f35589ec&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true,

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

And morale problems within the firefighting force persisted, even as Natural Resources and Forestry Minister (MNRF) Graydon Smith offered financial incentives of up to $5,000 for firefighters who toil on the front lines. Smith, a Parry Sound-area MPP, gave a nod to firefighters, noting ""they work tirelessly under very difficult conditions to protect the health and safety of Ontarians."" ""In addition to (the financial) incentive,"" Smith said, ""we continue to explore longer-term strategies and solutions to support attraction and retention of critical jobs for future years."" The union representing Ontario's fire rangers said it would take the incentives offer, but it also threw cold water on the amount, calling it ""a drop in the bucket"" and a ""Band-Aid response."" The incentives ""will all be lump-sum payments that do not contribute to workers' salaries or pensions,"" the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) said in a separate news release. More than 1,000 wildland fire rangers and aviation crew members are eligible to receive the incentives, the ministry says. Shuniah mayor and Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association president Wendy Landry applauded the ministry's offer, calling it ""a great incentive to have folks apply"" to be fire rangers. ""Northwestern Ontario municipalities and the North as a whole are concerned about the potential of wildfires,"" Landry said on Friday. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union called Smith's announcement a publicity stunt ""more concerned about suppressing criticism than protecting our air quality and human life."" ""The government has ignored wildfire workers' recommendations to fix the (human resources) crisis, and instead, has scrambled to throw scraps at the crisis and the front-line workers who risk their lives,"" the Ontario Public Service Employees Union said in its news release. The new incentives are limited to ""those in certain job classifications"" and followed a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach by the province, the Ontario Public Service Employees Union claimed. In previous years, the province has aimed to hire about 800 fire rangers spread over four-person crews, although that target is not always met. An Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services spokesman said the department has yet to share how many rangers it plans to hire this season, but said recruitment continues. ""As a precaution, MNRF is planning for early spring fires by proactively bringing some fire rangers and support staff back early to address any potential needs arising from spring hazards,"" the spokesman said. Last year's wildfire season in Ontario was one of the worst on record, burning more than 4,400 square kilometres -- three times the 10-year average. Most of the 700 fires occurred in Northern Ontario. Provincial fire rangers, who often work in grim, smoke-filed conditions, have long contended they are under-paid. In the last few years, there have been reports by Ontario Public Service Employees Union members about the province struggling to attract fire rangers and keeping them long enough so that they can gain enough experience to become crew leaders. The starting wage for an Ontario fire ranger is about $25 per hour. Meanwhile, signs of morale problems festered this week at the Aviation Forest Fires and Emergency Services office in Sault Ste. Marie. A management memo calling for ""respect"" was issued to department staff after someone posted a sign in the office's lobby disparaging the department's leaders. ""This is not the first instance where disrespectful communication has been sent to or directed at the AFFES leadership team,"" the memo said.

Taking advantage of the anions, further advances would be realized by tuning the spatial arrangements of the selective binding sites according to the shape of hexane isomers. Thus, the interpenetrated anion-functionalized MOFs ZU-72 (ZU = Zhejiang University, also termed SNFSIX-2-Cu-i, 2 = 4,4-dipyridylacetylene, i = interpenetrated), isomorphic to the SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, with pore sizes distributed around 3.6-5.9 Å, are synthesized. The three-dimensional frameworks are formed by six-copper node coordinated with four organic linkers and then pillared with SnF anions (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The anions create a strong electrostatic environment to trap guest molecules (Supplementary Fig. 1b). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c, through interpenetration, the anions are orderly arranged to the ""zigzag"" geometry, which can recognize isomers with different shapes. Nitrogen adsorption at 77 K on ZU-72 gives a BET surface area of 572 m g (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that ZU-72 is stable up to 496 K (Supplementary Fig. 6). The non-interpenetrated SIFSIX-1-Cu (1 = 4,4'-dipyridine) is constructed by six-copper node coordinated with four organic linkers and then pillared with SiF anions, with pore sizes distributed around 6.8-7.2 Å (Supplementary Fig. 2), larger than that of ZU-72. ZU-61 (also termed NbOFFIVE-1-Ni) is isomorphic to SIFSIX-1-Cu, with slightly wider pore sizes distributed around 7.3-7.8 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4). The bulk purity of these anion-functionalized MOF samples is confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) tests (Supplementary Figs. 7-11).

Hexane isomers separation performance

The single-component equilibrium isotherms reveal that ZU-72 shows prominent discrimination for hexane isomers according to the degree of branching. As shown in Fig. 2a, the uptake of nHEX on ZU-72 is up to 2.12 mmol g at 16 kPa and 298 K, which is 1.31 times higher than that of zeolite 5 A (1.62 mmol g, Supplementary Fig. 16) and higher than other good performing MOFs (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, ZU-72 can distinguish mono-branched isomers from the linear nHEX with the uptake of 1.19 mmol g for 2MP and 1.23 mmol g for 3MP. The di-branched isomers, 23DMB and 22DMB, are not allowed to be adsorbed on ZU-72 owing to their larger molecular size (5.6 Å and 6.2 Å, respectively), and the complete size sieving effect is also confirmed by the dynamic adsorption test (Supplementary Fig. 12), endowing ZU-72 with the record separation selectivity of mono-/di-branched (6.97), higher than the isostructural SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (5.53) and previous benchmark materials, Fe(BDP) (1.21) and Al-bttotb (4.72) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 21). This is a remarkable advancement since it is a great challenge to precisely cut hexane isomers up to five components based on the degree of branching, especially with the ability to exclude both two di-branched isomers from the mono-branched ones, which has rarely been achieved. The distinctive attributes of ZU-72 is the introduction of SnF anion compared with other anion-functionalized isostructures (Supplementary Fig. 38). Furthermore, for the larger di-branched hexanes, SIFSIX-1-Cu with suitable pore size and large crystal size realizes the size exclusion effect of 22DMB (8.0 × 6.7 × 5.9 Å) from 23DMB (7.8 × 6.7 × 5.3 Å), with the remarkably high capacity of 23DMB (4.25 mmol g at 16 kPa and 298 K) and record selectivity of di-branched isomers (22.16) (Fig. 2b, d). The sieving performance is also evidenced by the differential scanning calorimetry experiments (Supplementary Fig. 18) and the dynamic adsorption test (Supplementary Fig. 19). It is worth mentioning that for the separation of gases with extremely similar structures, achieving such a high adsorption capacity under the circumstance of complete size exclusion is attractive. In addition, for the currently popular separation (nHEX/3MP/22DMB), SIFSIX-1-Cu also shows the best separation performance than previously reported benchmarks (Supplementary Figs. 20 and 22). We also observe the efficient separation performance of 23DMB and 22DMB in ZU-61 (Supplementary Fig. 24). To the best of our knowledge, the exceptional performance is unprecedented and enables the possible production of gasoline with RON higher than 100.

Furthermore, the breakthrough experiments were conducted to demonstrate the actual separation ability of the above materials (see Supplementary Information for breakthrough measurement details). As the equimolar quinary mixture of nHEX, 2MP, 3MP, 23DMB, and 22DMB passed through the column packed with activated ZU-72, a separated eluted sequence was observed for alkanes with different branching. As shown in Fig. 3a, the di-branched 23DMB and 22DMB, as the most desirable gasoline components with high RONs, broke through almost immediately, followed by the mono-branched 2MP and 3MP (~50 mL), between which the RON of the eluted product was higher than 98 as calculated from the breakthrough curves, significantly higher than the value of 87 using the zeolite 5A (Supplementary Fig. 27). The nHEX exhibited the longest retention time of 230 mL, and the working capacity for ZU-72 was 1.69 mmol g, exceeding the previous benchmark material, Fe(BDP) (0.41 mmol g). The productivity of high-quality gasoline (RON > 95) for ZU-72 (15.8 mL g) was higher than that of SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (14.3 mL g), Fe(BDP) (1.5 mL g) (Supplementary Fig. 32). Moreover, we also measured the 23DMB/22DMB binary mixture performance on SIFSIX-1-Cu and ZU-61, a clean and sharp separation of the two di-branched hexanes was observed (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 34). The 22DMB eluted immediately with a negligible uptake of 0.05 mmol g on SIFSIX-1-Cu due to the exclusion effect, while the 23DMB was trapped in the column retaining 140 mL (Fig. 3b). The following desorption operations enabled the further upgrading of gasoline with the highest RON (~105) (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 35), with a productivity of 55.6 mL g. In addition, the cycle and regeneration capabilities were further investigated by breakthrough tests (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 36), there is no noticeable decrease of breakthrough times during the three cycles, revealing excellent recyclability. The exceptional separation performances of ZU-72, SIFSIX-1-Cu, and ZU-61 announced their great potential for gasoline upgrading. And the demonstrated strategy is also applicable for the efficient separation of pentane isomers (Supplementary Fig. 14) and heptane isomers (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 23).

Energy of regeneration

Except for the high capacity and selectivity, the energy consumption for regeneration of porous materials is also vital in alkane isomers separation, which is closely related to the energy efficiency. In this regard, ZU-72, designed for hexane isomers separation, takes up 30% more nHEX than commercial zeolite 5A (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, ZU-72 exhibits an excellent adsorption rate of nHEX, better than zeolite 5A (Fig. 4b), which is essentially important to improve the working capacity as well as the regeneration efficiency. Also, ZU-72 is easy to be regenerated under moderate regeneration condition only through a simple vacuum processing without additional heating (~25 °C), just for 15 min (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13), and the invariable cyclic adsorption-desorption performance verifies its easy regeneration performance (Fig. 4c). In contrast, much higher temperatures, up to 200 °C for 8 h, are the prerequisites for zeolite 5A to realize the completed regeneration (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 17). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments are further conducted to measure the heat released of nHEX on ZU-72 and zeolite 5 A, quantitatively evaluating the corresponding regeneration energy. About 47 kJ of energy input is sufficient to regenerate 1 mol of nHEX adsorbed on ZU-72, saving almost 45% of energy compared to the energy for regeneration of zeolite 5A (86 kJ mol) under the same conditions (Fig. 4d).

The large energy saving of ZU-72 attracted us to further explore the latent energy management during the sorption processes. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements were performed on the bare (activated) and nHEX-loaded ZU-72. An orientational disorder-order transition of both pyridine rings and SnF anions was observed after the accommodation of the guest molecules. The flexibility of the structure accounts for the hysteresis behavior observed in the adsorption isotherms. In the bare ZU-72, the pyridine rings formed a plane angle of ±22.5° with the ac (or bc) crystallographic plane with neighboring rings, and the exposed F atoms exhibited highly disordered (state I) (Fig. 4g), while in the nHEX-loaded MOF structure, the pyridine rings were vertical, parallel to the c axis and the exposed F atoms extended to the 0 or 38° (state II) (Fig. 4h). It is reasonable to believe that the adaptive structural transformation of ZU-72 would impose effects on the energy transition, and its specific role is further explored by the total energy calculation as a function of the rotational angle of SnF or the pyridine rings using the first-principles DFT-D (dispersion-corrected density functional theory) method. As shown in Fig. 4i, j, the rotational behavior of either pyridine or SnF anions would trigger the energy release/storage of the framework, and the energy contribution to the framework was about 9-25 kJ mol. Also, the above structural change from state I to state II caused by the load of nHEX seemed to function as the energy storage part within the framework. However, the above calculation neglected the potential correlation between the two rotational behaviors, it was not appropriate to simply add or subtract the energy changes caused by the single factor. Therefore, to verify and reveal the specific value of energy storage, the conformation energy of the two states was determined separately, and the results indicated that the ZU-72 framework required ~15 kJ mol energy input to achieve the structural transformation, from state I to state II. The intrinsic thermal management capability of ZU-72 is relative higher than the Fe(bdp) (8.1 kJ mol ) and Co(bdp) (7.0 kJ mol ) utilized for CH storage. Meanwhile, such a structural transformation is fully reversible (Supplementary Fig. 37), that is, the potential energy stored in the backbone due to the structural change upon adsorption will be delivered during the desorption process (transition from state II to state I), which leads to the moderate regeneration condition. Such an energy offset phenomenon triggered by the adaptive backbone is believed to exert positive influence to lower the energy input required for the regeneration.

In addition, the adsorption behavior of nHEX on ZU-72 and zeolite 5A was determined by the MC simulation and further DFT-D theory optimization. In ZU-72, the nHEX molecule was adsorbed within a triangular electrostatic domain (""zigzag"" anion sites) created by the three SnF anions from different nets, and almost all the hydrogen of nHEX was able to find an available F-binding site. The distance of C-H···F interactions was about 2.10-3.20 Å (Fig. 4e), and the DFT-D-calculated static adsorption energy (ΔE) was 46.08 kJ mol. The dense multiple interactions led to its high nHEX capacity. While in the zeolite 5A, except for the dense C-H···O interactions (2.0-3.20 Å) between nHEX and the available on the pore surface, the carbon atoms of nHEX exhibited another strong interaction with the free cations (Na, Ca) inside the pore channel (Fig. 4f), making the nHEX molecule too tightly bound, and the corresponding binding energy was as high as 118.29 kJ mol. Experience has indicated that the physisorbents with binding energies on the order of 45-60 kJ mol lie in the ""sweet spot"". Below that, the adsorption capacity cannot be guaranteed, while above that makes excessive regeneration energy consumption. Overall, the intrinsic energy management of the flexible framework and the suitable strength of host-guest interactions achieve the high adsorption capacity and low regeneration energy of ZU-72, making it promising for alkane isomers separation.",nature.com,news,Nature,,0.1294117647058823,448906100,1,https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46738-2/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46738_Fig1_HTML.png,

Speaking in an interview on Channels TV's Politics Today on Friday, Makinde chided the 16 governors' who submitted a report on the matter to the National Economic Council, NEC.

The governor asserted that the submission of memoranda by governors for state police was a waste of time.

NEC had on Thursday confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police. They said it would help tackle the plethora of security challenges confronting the nation.

However, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Weighing in on the matter, Makinde said the issue of state police was a constitutional matter and should be handled by the national assembly and then the states' legislative bodies.

""I did not submit any memorandum on state police. But my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time.

""I did not submit, not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde stated the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser were not legally equipped to handle such security matter.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

The governor said: ""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work.

""It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly.

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

Although the meeting was intended to be informational, tribal, Navajo EPA and community leaders expressed their uncertainty about whether the federal government will actually start addressing the cleanup of the abandoned uranium mines that landed the site on the EPA list, also known as the Superfund program.

The mining district encompasses Navajo Nation communities of Cove, Round Rock and Lukachukai in the far northeastern corner of Arizona.

""We are looking at what happened in the past and how the federal government could have prevented a lot of this contamination,"" said Council Delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty, ""could've prevented our community from getting sick. What I don't want them (children) to have to deal with is another three or four decades before actual action happens.""

Phil Harrison remembers when his childhood community of Cove was alive with family gatherings, ceremonies, rodeos, farming and ranching, but after decades of uranium contamination, those days are a thing of the past.

""There is no more farming, orchards, family gatherings and Cove is really empty,"" said Harrison. ""Scarred by the negligence of the federal government leaving all these contaminants behind.""

Harrison's father was a miner in the uranium mines of Cove, which was where uranium was first discovered on the Navajo Nation. Uranium production in the northern and western Carrizo Mountains of the Navajo Nation began in 1948, peaked in 1955 and 1956 and declined to zero again by 1967.

After mining in unventilated mines for over 20 years, Harrison's father died of lung cancer. His grandfather, who was also a rancher in Cove, died of cancer, and so did his uncles. Many of those living in the community recall similar experiences and see the effects today.

""The rain and snow kept washing these contaminated waste out into these washes,"" said Harrison. ""A lot of people were exposed to uranium and I know many families that engage in their father's mining history and they have cancers.""

Superfund listing took years of lobbying by Navajo officials

The Lukachukai Mountains Mining District includes 100 mine waste piles from past mining contaminated with radium-226, uranium and other heavy metals.

Waste from the piles ran downstream in washes and contaminated groundwater and continues to affect the water source, Harrison said. According to the EPA, past ore hauling activities may have spread contamination along miles of mountainous haul roads.

""I think by now a lot of people don't farm anymore because the washes are all contaminated,"" said Harrison. ""They should actually do core drilling, core testing, like every mile down the stream all the way out to the main runoff into the San Juan River. With that amount of time I'm sure it contaminated the whole wash basin in the area.""

Although the last Navajo administration had supported placing the mining district on the Superfund list, getting attention and funding to clean up the area has been decades in the making.

""When I learned about this proposal, which was initiated in the prior administration, we were supportive of it right away,"" said Navajo EPA director Stephan Benally. ""But there was questions based on my experience.""

Benally gave a quick timeline of his years working on getting funding and assistance from the federal government to address the abandoned uranium mines. He was first made Navajo EPA director in 2003 and was in that role for 12 years. He came back on as director in 2022. He said the Navajo Nation had gone to Congress in the late 1990s to ask for help and funding to address abandoned uranium mines.

In 2012, he said they decided to get involved in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. lawsuit. In 2014, the U.S. District Court approved an almost $1 billion settlement through the U.S. EPA to investigate and clean up 50 uranium mines operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation on or near the Navajo Nation.

From the late 1940s to the 1980s, Kerr-McGee Corporation mined upward of 7 million tons of uranium ore on or near the Navajo Nation. About 32 of these mines are located in the Cove.

""Those are some of the few battle scars I have,"" said Benally. ""And other experiences that have all been a part of the background for today's events.""

Listing is 'a guarantee from the United States' of the site's cleanup

Cliff Villa, from the Land and Emergency Management Office for the U.S. EPA, had worked on the Coeur D'Alene Mining District in Idaho, which was the richest silver district ever discovered in America and where major mining operations continued for over 100 years. It is also the site of one of the biggest Superfund cleanup projects.

He said he had worked alongside the Coeur D'Alene tribe to get resources for the cleanup and he will soon visit there again in celebration of a successful cleanup.

""We are here celebrating the beginning of a process,"" said Villa. ""The National Priorities List is a guarantee from the United States that this community will be a national priority for the EPA. It is a promise. We are here and we are here to stay in partnership.""

Kenyon Larsen, the remedial project manager for the Lukachukai Mountain Mining District listing, said the Cove mountain has numerous mines, some of which are funded by the Kerr-McGee settlement, now connected to that company's successor, Tronox.

""There are a lot of holes which means there are a lot of waste piles,"" said Larsen. ""Which means there was a district that was created with lots of different points of contamination and that was an opportunity to list another mining district on the National Priorities listing.""

Harrison is a member of the Navajo Nation Uranium Radiation Victims Committee, which was founded in the late 1970s. For decades, Harrison and this group have been championing the expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, persisting in their efforts despite limited resources.

Although they are working to aid Navajo uranium miners, they receive no financial assistance from the tribal government. Through the lobbying endeavors of this group, the Senate passed S3853, allocating funds for the compensation act and prolonging its duration for another six years. It also broadens the eligibility for funding for people exposed to radiation, among other provisions.

""We actually witnessed the voting in the gallery,"" said Harrison. ""The senators took an hour to vote on this and it was really something to witness. We lobbied like crazy.""

Harrison is also battling his own health issues as a result of being a miner and working as a remediation specialist.

He said when he started working as a miner in 1969 at the John Brown Uranium Mine in Gateway, Colo., he was given a shovel with no other information about how dangerous uranium mining would be. When his dad was a uranium miner in the mountains of Cove he said he too was never told of the health dangers.

""These companies never gave the community back anything that would be sustainable,"" said Harrison. ""I think I only seen two steel picnic tables that was signed off by Kerr-McGee at Red Valley chapter that's the only thing we got from the companies and federal government. They should initiate some kind of farming initiative in a safe manner or build a bug gymnasium for our young people. The companies just left and never looked back.""

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped the Senate pass the final six bills to fund the government through Fiscal Year 2024, which runs through September 30, 2024. Peters secured major funding wins in the bipartisan legislation for local projects and issues important to communities across Michigan. The final package of bills now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.

""This bipartisan legislation delivers critical resources to communities across the state of Michigan and our entire country. It will help protect the Great Lakes, secure our borders, strengthen our national security, drive economic growth, and expand access to quality, affordable child care. It shows how much we can do when we put politics aside and bring home commonsense solutions for the American people,"" said Senator Peters.

As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Peters helped the committee pass all twelve annual appropriations bills. Peters is the first Michigan senator to serve on this committee since 1959.

Peters led or supported the following provisions in the funding legislation on issues important to Michiganders:

Strengthening America's National Defense and Homeland Security

Northern Border Coordination Center: Peters secured $3 million to stand up a Northern Border Coordination Center that would be located at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. It will help the Department of Homeland Security coordinate border security efforts across the Northern Border, and support personnel training and high-tech border security technology testing. Peters has also advanced bipartisan legislation in the Senate to establish the Northern Border Coordination Center and to ensure assets like Selfridge remain at the forefront of the nation's homeland and national security missions.

Exercise Northern Strike: Peters secured a provision in this bill providing $23.5 million in funding to support Exercise Northern Strike - the National Guard Bureau's largest joint service, multicomponent exercise. Northern Strike takes place annually at the National All-Domain Warfighting Center (NADWC), which utilizes both the Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center and the Alpena Combat Readiness Center, which are both based in Northern Michigan.

Collaborative Combat Aircraft: Peters secured language in the bill authorizing a report that will clarify the basing criteria for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and evaluate whether existing Air National Guard units, such as Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, are appropriate basing candidates for CCA. These types of unmanned aircraft are the future of warfare, and this report will help Selfridge Air National Guard Base better position itself as an installation that has significant long-term value for the Air Force. Last year, Peters underscored the importance of CCA technology in a confirmation hearing for Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force General David W. Allvin.

Stryker Armored Vehicles: The bill provides $4.2 million to help the Army update the Stryker Family of Armored Vehicles with driver-assistance technology. This funding will support autonomous capability efforts taking place at the Ground Vehicles Systems Center (GVSC) in Warren, and help ensure that Made in Michigan ground vehicles like the Strykers are operating with cutting edge technology designed to keep our servicemembers safe.

High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs): The legislation provides $47.5 million for the Army to upgrade its HMMWVs with anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control systems that will help prevent rollovers, which have claimed the lives of far too many servicemembers. These kits are made in Troy and this funding would help support over 150 jobs.

Hiring Additional Customs and Border Protection Personnel: The bill includes funding to hire additional CBP Officers to interdict illegal drugs like fentanyl and facilitate safe and secure lawful trade and travel and ensure that states like Michigan can remain international hubs of commerce. It also includes funding for additional Border Patrol Agents who support the border security mission between ports of entry. Peters has led bipartisan legislation to fully staff America's ports of entry.

Border Security Technology The bill includes funding for critical technology for CBP and between ports of entry that enhances front line personnel to carry out their border security mission. This includes non-intrusive inspection systems, which enable CBP's to inspect of vehicles and cargo entering the United States more effectively and efficiently. This also includes funding to support outbound inspections. Peters has led bipartisan legislation to increase the use of these systems to ensure secure travel and trade at ports of entry.

Gordie Howe International Bridge: The bill also helps the Department of Homeland Security continue to prepare for the completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge by providing $1M to Homeland Security Investigations to increase capacity to support investigations resulting from the use of non-intrusive inspection systems that will be deployed at the bridge.

Blue Water Bridge: The bill requires Customs and Border Protection to report on its plans for completion of the Blue Water Bridge Plaza expansion project, as well as its steps taken in the last year toward completion. Peters has long worked with state and federal partners to modernize this port of entry.

Helping Communities Recover from Disaster: Peters secured significant funding in the bill for the Disaster Relief Fund, a program which enables the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help communities recover in the wake of disasters and emergencies. Peters has been a leader in passing legislation to help disaster survivors get back on their feet.

Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP): The bill includes funding for the NSGP, which Peters haschampioned, to help religious institutions, including synagogues, churches, mosques, gurdwaras, and other nonprofits strengthen their security in the face of rising threats and attacks. Peters helped lead the reauthorization of this essential program last Congress.

Support for Local Firefighters: The bill includes funding for FEMA's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grant program, which provide resources to help local fire departments hire and retain personnel, purchase safety equipment, conduct trainings and access health screenings for firefighters. Peters passed bipartisan legislation in the Senate to extend these critical programs, which are set to expire.

DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office: The bill provides funding for DHS's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, allowing it to continue operations through September 30, 2024. The office leads DHS's effort to safeguard the country from threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, which include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led efforts to reauthorize and improve this vital office.

Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs: The bill provides funding for the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA), which coordinates the Department of State's diplomatic, family, congressional, and external engagements related to overseas hostage-taking and wrongful detention, such as in the case of Michigander Paul Whelan. SPEHA's mission is to secure the freedom of U.S. national hostages and wrongful detainees held abroad, support their families, and end the practice of hostage-taking and wrongful detention as coercive diplomatic practices.

Office of the National Cyber Director: The bill includes funding for the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), which coordinates a whole-of-government approach to implement federal cybersecurity strategy. The ONCD's mission is to advance national security, economic prosperity, and technological innovation through cybersecurity policy. As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Peters has led numerous efforts to increase our nation's cybersecurity defenses and build resilience across critical infrastructure sectors.

Investing in Education & Lowering the Cost of Child Care

Funding for K-12 Schools: The bill protects funding for K-12 schools through Title I-A grants to provide financial assistance to schools with high numbers of children from low-income families to help ensure that all children can receive a quality education and meet state academic standards.

Head Start: The bill increases funding for Head Start, which ensures children in low-income families can access quality preschool education.

Quality, Affordable Child Care: The bill increases funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which is the primary federal program that expands access to child care for low-income families and improves the quality of child care for all children. The bill also funds the Department of Defense's child care programs, including increased funding for universal pre-K, which will double pre-K enrollment of children of servicemembers.

Assistance to Schools After Violent or Traumatic Events: Peters fought to protect funding in the bill for the Department of Education's Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) Grant Program, which provides critical funding to help schools and colleges respond to and recover from violent or traumatic events.

Expanding Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care

National Institutes of Health (NIH): The bill increases funding for the NIH, including increased funding for mental health research, Alzheimer's research, reducing maternal mortality, and cancer research.

Strengthening Our Health Care Workforce: The bill provides increased funding to strengthen the health care workforce through investments in community health centers, school-based health centers, and efforts to bolster public health infrastructure and rebuild the workforce at the state and local level.

Support for Young People Struggling with Substance Use Disorders: The bill protects funding for the Youth Prevention and Recovery Initiative that Peters established in 2018, which provides grant funding to local health care providers to help expand access to opioid addiction treatment for adolescents. The program also provides grant funding to schools, community organizations, and others to help raise awareness of the risks of fentanyl use among youth. Peters is currently working to renew this program and ensure this critical resource remains available to adolescents, families, care providers, and communities. His bipartisan provision to continue the programadvanced in the Senate earlier this year through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act.

Protecting the Great Lakes

U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes Center of Expertise: The bill provides continued support for the U.S. Coast Guard Great Lakes Center of Expertise (GLCOE), which Peters established to examine the impacts of oil spills in freshwater environments and help develop effective responses. The center's work is critical to protecting the Great Lakes, as current oil spill response technologies are primarily designed for saltwater environments. Petersauthored and passed legislation into law establishing the Great Lakes Center of Expertise in 2018, and thenannounced the center will be headquartered in two Michigan locations to maximize research and operational capabilities: Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor.

Great Lakes Icebreaker: The bill provides $20 million for the procurement of a new Great Lakes icebreaker that is at least as capable as the USCGC Mackinaw. Peters has continuously pressed for funding to secure a new icebreaker for the Great Lakes to ensure safe and efficient commerce on the Great Lakes year-round. Icebreaking in the Great Lakes is critical not just for Michigan's economy - but for our entire country. Icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes supports more than 90 million tons of cargo annually. Acquiring an additional heavy icebreaker like the USCGC Mackinaw is needed to prevent ice jam flooding damage to shoreline communities and protect maritime commerce and jobs throughout the Great Lakes region.

Supporting Businesses, Manufacturers & Local Economic Development

LIFT Advanced Manufacturing Center: Peters helped secure $10 million for research and development of critical materials processing to support LIFT's work scaling up commercialization of ceramic-related technology. LIFT, which Peters played a key role in establishing, is an organization in Detroit that brings together industry, academia, and government to advance our nation's economy and national security by accelerating innovative advanced manufacturing technology and talent development.

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund: The bill secures funding for the CDFI Fund, which Peters has championed, to provide credit, capital and financial services to underserved populations and communities in Michigan and across the country. It would also allocate funding for the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund, which Peters has strongly supported, to help low-income-designated credit unions provide financial services for their members and spur economic growth in their communities.

Women's Business Centers: The bill includes funding for Women's Business Centers within the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide low-cost counseling and training for women who want to start, grow, or expand their small business.

Microloan Technical Assistance for Small Businesses: The bill provides funding for the Microloan Program to deliver technical assistance and small-scale loans to small businesses that are unable to qualify for conventional loans and other guaranteed loans.

Making Government More Efficient & Saving Taxpayer Dollars

Conducting Strong Oversight of Taxpayer Dollars: The bill includes continued support for the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), which conducts oversight, improves transparency and addresses fraud within the spending and distribution of pandemic response funds. Peters established this independent oversight committee through a bipartisan provision he authored and secured in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Supporting National Archives Digitization and Operations: The bill provides continued funding for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for digitization of records. This funding will also support NARA's continuing work to provide veterans with access to service records for the purpose of receiving VA benefits.

The bill also includes funding secured by Peters for high-impact public local projects in Michigan that can benefit from federal assistance. For a full list of the projects Peters supported that were included in the bill, click HERE or see below:

Lake St. Clair Metropark: The Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority will receive $1.42 million to replace key components of the Lake St. Clair Metropark electrical grid to improve its safety, reliability, and resiliency.

Northern Michigan University (NMU) Security Operations Center: Peters helped deliver more than $1.1 million for NMU in Marquette to create a Security Operations Center, which will serve as a community-based cybersecurity resource for small businesses and entrepreneurs throughout the Upper Peninsula.

Supporting Innovation, Economic Opportunity, and Workforce Development

Henry Ford College Student Success Center: Peters helped secure $3 million for Henry Ford College in Dearborn to support career education and training needs in southeast Michigan.

Alma Center for Business Innovation, Incubation, and Development: Peters helped secure $2 million in the bill for the City of Alma to help create a small business hub to support entrepreneurs in key economic sectors of Mid-Michigan.

West Michigan Center for Talent, Technology, and Transformation: Grand Valley State University will receive $2.5 million to launch a collaboration effort between regional employers and economic development organizations to grow West Michigan's technology workforce.

Capac Catalyst Innovation Center: The Village of Capac will receive $271,000 to support creation of Capac Catalyst, a workforce development center which aims to promote small businesses and entrepreneurs in the manufacturing technology industry.

Semiconductor Workforce Development at Delta College: The bill provides $284,000 to Delta College to develop curriculum and apprenticeship opportunities in semiconductor production and research. Peters has made strengthening domestic semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains a top priority. Peters helped author and pass into law the historic CHIPS and Science Act, which includes a provision Peters secured to support the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies and ensure that projects supporting critical manufacturing industries are given priority status, which would include the automotive sector. This is in addition to $50 billion Peters already secured in the bill to incentivize the production of semiconductors of all kinds in the U.S. - for a total of $52 billion. The CHIPS and Science Act also included Peters' bipartisan Investing in Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Act, which will ensure federal incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing include U.S. suppliers that produce the materials and manufacturing equipment that enable semiconductor manufacturing - bolstering semiconductors supply chains and Michigan manufacturers.

Expanding Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care

Supporting Expectant and New Mothers in Dearborn: The City of Dearborn will receive $1 million to provide education, supplies, and other resources for prenatal health and newborn care to support expectant and new mothers throughout Dearborn.

Supporting New and Expectant Mothers in Detroit: SisterFriends Detroit, through the Detroit Health Department, will receive $900,000 to train and certify doulas and provide both mothers and fathers with training and education during the perinatal and postpartum periods. SisterFriends works to improve birth outcomes and infant mortality rates in Detroit by connecting volunteer mentors with women who are pregnant or recently had a baby to gain access to services and resources.

Here are 7 ways to put it to good use","Nina Pineda has tips on how to avoid tax scams and what to look out for.

NEW YORK -- The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS.

Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there's a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you're also owed a refund from your state government.

That money may feel like a windfall, and it's easy to squander it on a lot of little things.

But if you're looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you'll enjoy the seventh the most.

1. Pay off high-rate debt

If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down.

At such sky-high rates, ""the debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients.

Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people's awareness of how much money they're paying in interest over time doesn't always register.

""What I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they're charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. ... They don't understand how much interest they're paying,"" Russ said.

For example, if you're carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 -- and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com's calculator.

2. Create or add to an emergency fund

You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund.

When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don't have at least three months' worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000.

Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks.

If you have high-rate debt and you're lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund.

Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you're low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job -- such as on your car -- he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt.

3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage

If you're carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you're not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. ""It can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,"" Russ said.

Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts

You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you're saving yourself an extra 7% or so in interest on the portion of the principal you're paying down, Bronnenkant noted.

4. Invest in a Roth IRA

If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you're at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years.

(And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great. But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, Bronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2.

(For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.)

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

This measure forms part of the broader Anti-Money Laundering (AML) directives aimed at combating financial crimes. A majority of the European Parliament's leading commission on March 19 approved the decision, and this stand implies a unified stand against anonymous transactions.

The regulation targets transactions through self-custody wallets that lack proper identification, encompassing those facilitated by mobile, desktop, or browser applications. The plan is tailored to overcome the gap that enables the anonymous movement of funds, which is a way used to commit crimes. The ban applies both to cash transactions above 10,000 euros and to anonymous cryptocurrency payments over 3,000 euros.

Cryptocurrency Market Faces Tight EU Regulations

The newly endorsed legislation is scheduled to be fully implemented within three years of its official promulgation. Nevertheless, Dillon Eustace, an Irish law firm, forecasts a faster implementation of those rules, which, in turn, will mark a rapid change in the cryptocurrency market. There are a lot of specific regulations on cash and anonymous crypto transactions, which makes financial operations in the EU rather tight and stricter.

Resistance to the legislation has been considerable, as demonstrated by the German MEP Patrick Breyer and Gunnar Beck of the Alternative for Germany party, who voted against the regulation. He has raised the issue of violations of financial privacy and autonomy on the grounds that they undermine the right to engage in anonymous transactions. Their opposition demonstrates the extent to which people disagree on the trade-offs between safety and individual liberties.

Crypto Rules Raise Privacy and Use Concerns

The cryptocurrency sector has expressed significant concerns over the EU's new regulatory measures. Daniel ""Loddi"" Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, articulated the practical challenges introduced by the legislation. He pointed out the potential for these laws to hinder not only personal financial privacy but also the broader application of cryptocurrencies within the EU. The emphasis was on the detrimental effects of donations and the general use of digital currencies.

Despite the restrictions, it's important to note that self-custody to self-custody transactions remain outside the scope of the new regulations. This distinction indicates a nuanced approach to regulation, aiming to curb misuse while not completely stifling the inherent freedoms offered by cryptocurrency networks. The crypto community's response has been mixed, with some acknowledging the necessity of AML laws and others fearing an overreach that could impact privacy and economic liberty.

Tax season has started. Here are 8 things to do before you file

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN

5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match

Speaking of retirement savings, if you're not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier.

Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have.

For instance, say you're paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000).

""You want to get the max match from your employer,"" Bronnenkant said.

6. Invest for shorter-term goals

If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds.

The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds.

But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you're comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance.

If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live.

7. Have some fun

Unless you're in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy.

""Sometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,"" Russ said. ""You can set aside some of the money to have fun.""

Mohammed, who is also the managing partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, made the call at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos on Friday.

The theme of the event was ""Disinformation and Misinformation: The Media in the Age of Discontent.""

Mohammed stressed the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence

He noted that his call was not an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step geared towards ensuring that the social media platforms are held accountable.

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of Social Media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Mohammed further urged the current President Bola Tinubu administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using the platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

He noted that social media remains a major space for proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation were far-reaching in the sense of undermining democratic processes, among others.

His words: ""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratized access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation.

""The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety. False narratives surrounding elections can trigger legitimacy problems for the winner.

""There were conspiracy theories fueling vaccine hesitancy as witnessed during the COVID 19 pandemic among other consequences of fake news. The impact of misinformation can be devastating, exacerbating existing fault-lines and hindering collective action.""

He, however, made efforts to clear the air on why the Buhari-led administration suspended the services of Twitter, now X, stating that the move was to checkmate the nefarious activities of some groups bent on promoting anarchy.

According to him, ""We were compelled to suspend the services of Twitter, now X, when it became evident that Twitter had yielded its platform to proscribed groups, who were bent on promoting anarchy and destabilizing the country.""",leadership.ng,news,Leadership,Samson Elijah,-0.03529411764705881,448904281,1,https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lai-Mohammed-new.webp,eng-9420039

As many of our peer cities are seeing exorbitant housing prices and costs of doing business, Greater Louisville is seizing this opportunity to market our advantages in affordability, logistics and quality of life. Over the past year, the Kentucky General Assembly lowered the state's personal income tax by a full percent and is working diligently to meet revenue triggers to further reduce it in the coming years. Plus, they have invested in innovative programs like the Kentucky Product Development Initiative, that are helping to make our state more attractive to corporate investment.

KY budget: Kentucky Senate budget includes much more spending out of the state 'rainy day fund'

We are already seeing the pay-off from these programs and other policies. Last year, Greater Louisville Inc. grew our economic development project pipeline by 93%, showing there is rising interest in businesses relocating and expanding to our region. But we cannot stop here. In addition to addressing long-term issues like workforce participation and public safety, we have to finish what we started with tax reform by creating more opportunities for community investment through local tax structures.

Louisville has a unique economy that employs hundreds of thousands of people and welcomes millions more through tourism. Right now, much of the city's funding comes from taxation on our workers through an occupational tax. If we can change the model -- taxing consumption rather than production -- not only will we keep more money in Louisvillians pockets, we will also increase our ability to invest in community assets by capturing consumption-based revenue.

What can Louisville learn from other cities to improve tax law?

Two years ago, GLI took a group of 120 business and elected leaders to Jacksonville, Florida for our annual Greater Louisville Idea Development Expedition. We heard from Jacksonville's top leaders who attributed much of their success to updated infrastructure and improvement projects funded by small and incremental local taxes. From infrastructure investments to downtown revitalization, local funding for these large-scale projects and a competitive tax code has helped Jacksonville grow at an accelerated rate with more than 100 people moving to the region per day. One of our top takeaways from that trip was that Louisville, and all of Kentucky's cities, needs more flexibility in creating revenue streams to fund projects and support the needs of their communities.

Will Tax reform help Louisville? Submit your letter to the editor here.

Right now, Kentucky's Constitution limits the General Assembly from being able to update revenue-raising options at the county and municipal level. Occupational taxes remain the primary revenue generator in Greater Louisville. While the passage of state tax reform in 2022 emphasizes a move from production-based taxes to consumption-based taxes, our local governments are not reaping the same benefits.

GLI has prioritized local tax reform for many years. However, there has never been a more important time to make it a reality. If we are serious about making Louisville and all of Kentucky an economic powerhouse, we cannot afford to kick the can on local tax reform another year or two. Businesses are eager to invest in our region, so the time for building a competitive taxing structure is now.

A few weeks ago, Rep. Jonathan Dixon filed Kentucky House Bill 14, which will set up a voter referendum in November, and if approved by the majority of Kentuckians will amend Section 181 of the State Constitution to allow the General Assembly to create parameters in which a county, city, town or municipality could review and revise taxing structures. We strongly encourage the General Assembly to pass this measure and give Kentuckians the freedom and tools needed to create new local opportunities for investment.

Tax Saving Options for Employees Earning 35 Lakh And Above, Strategies Beyond Usual Explained, Check","Income Tax News: There are a few calculated ways for Indian citizens making more than 35 lakhs per year to save taxes. Here is a thorough how-to guide for maximising tax savings:

Utilize Section 80C Deductions

Invest in tax-saving options include tax-saving fixed deposits, the National Pension System (NPS), the Public Provident Fund (PPF), and the Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS). Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows deductions of up to ₹1.5 lakhs for these investments.

Contribute to Provident Fund

Increase the amount you contribute to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) by deducting salary. Section 80C allows for tax deductions on EPF contributions.

Invest in Health Insurance

Obtain health insurance for your family members as well as yourself. Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, health insurance premiums are deductible from taxes. Deductions are allowed for individuals under 60 years of age (₹25,000) and elderly people (₹50,000).

Explore Other Deductions

Take advantage of deductions for costs like house loan interest (Section 24), children's education (Section 80E), and charity contributions (Section 80G). These credits have the potential to drastically lower taxable income.

Utilize Professional Expenses

Make sure to claim deductions under Section 80TTA if you incur costs associated with your trade, such as travel, professional development courses, or equipment purchases.

Optimize Tax Planning

Get advice from tax experts or financial consultants to create a thorough tax-saving plan that works for your budget.

Illinois Realtors CEO Jeff Baker clapped back at Mayor Brandon Johnson late Friday night after the Associated Press officially declared Chicago voters had rejected a real estate transfer tax in Tuesday's election.

The head of the real estate trade group made a direct response to the mayor this week calling industry leaders' campaign tactics ""cowardly, cowardly,"" in comments to reporters.

Johnson made the remarks following election night, after it became clear that his signature policy was headed for defeat with more that 53 percent of voters saying ""no"" to the proposal. It would have quadrupled the city's tax on property sales of $1.5 million or more, to 3 percent of the sale price, in a bid to raise funds to combat homelessness. It also would have dropped the tax rate to 0.6 percent of the sale price for properties sold for less than $1 million, from the 0.75 percent rate charged now.

The mayor was referencing the fact that he felt hamstrung from campaigning more directly for the ballot measure due to city ethics rules surrounding referendums as well as his strict schedule, while opponents of the policy tied Johnson to the request to hike taxes. Real estate groups also focused on the fact that specific plans for how the additional revenues -- estimated by its proponents to average $100 million annually -- would be spent, other than vaguely dedicated to homeless services.

""It is not cowardly to demand the mayor provide details of his plans to raise real estate taxes,"" Baker said in a statement. ""It says nothing of the voters' character when they are tired of one property tax increase after another.

Baker added: ""Community organizing is about bringing people together, not finding ways to divide one another. BCH failed and now isn't the time for excuses. We remain committed to partnering with leaders who want to come together to find real solutions to the growing housing instability facing our city.""

Johnson also vowed to keep fighting against homelessness.

The ballot measure went down in a low-turnout election, and after a winding court battle led by real estate trade group the Building Owners and Managers Association challenged the referendum's constitutionality. A trial court judge ruled the measure wasn't legal to pose to voters, but that decision was overturned on an appeal by City Hall and the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, and votes on the measure ultimately counted.

Chicago real estate leaders' success in opposing the transfer tax provides a blueprint to the industry as voters and officials in other major markets consider similar policies. In California, voters in November will decide whether to repeal a similar transfer tax hike that Los Angeles approved via voter referendum in 2022, and prevent similar taxes from being imposed across the rest of the state, if the new measure passes.",therealdeal.com,news,The Real Deal New York,Sam Lounsberry,-0.3647058823529412,448903024,1,https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CHI-transfer-tax-results1.1-1400x875.jpg,eng-9418852

In Mumbai-where huge numbers of infrastructure and construction works are unfolding-the C&D waste is primarily collected through the 'debris on call' initiative wherein citizens call the civic body to collect the waste.

Besides this, the BMC also collects unclaimed heaps of debris discarded across the city. Meanwhile, other bulk generators of debris are construction projects such as metro worksites.

According to senior officials from the BMC, upon becoming operational, the processing units-each spanning up to 5 acres-will initially be treating unclaimed debris as well as the waste collected by the civic body as a part of their 'debris on call' drive.

Speaking to the Indian Express, an official said, ""Each plant has the capacity to treat 600 metric tonnes of waste daily. Currently, all the C&D waste is used to cover the dumping ground. But now, at these centres, we will be treating this waste. After processing through washing, crushing etc., the waste will be created into aggregates of different sizes. This aggregate can be precast, made to use paver blocks, tiles and other material.""

Slated to become operational from June this year, the civic body has appointed a contractor for a period of 20 years, who will be entrusted with tasks ranging from collection, transportation as well as processing of the waste at the units.

While officials said that nearly Rs 1,000 crore will be spent on each of the plant over a course of 20 years, the civic body will be paying Rs 1,425 per tonne to the contractor appointed to manage the Dahisar unit while the contractor at Shilphata will be paid Rs 1,400 per tonne in the first year.

In its fiscal budget for the year 2024-25, the BMC has earmarked Rs 230 crores for the project.

The BMC in its Mumbai Air Pollution Mitigation Plan (MAPMP) has identified dust arising from construction sites and uncovered construction and demolition debris as one of the key factors contributing to the rising pollution levels in the megapolis.

In a bid to create awareness about the units, the civic body is slated to conduct programmes in the upcoming months, appealing citizens to deliver the C&D to these processing plants.",indianexpress.com,news,The Indian Express,Nayonika Bose,-0.3098039215686275,448902876,1,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/waste-processing.jpg,

With major tax reform once again heading the list of legislative priorities, many analysts are hoping that the 108th Congress will make tax law far less a factor in economic decisions than it is today. Making the tax code more eco­nomically neutral is particularly desirable when it comes to the tax treatment of divi­dends paid on investments, since millions of Americans, including many who earn less than $100,000 a year, earn dividend income.

Corporations pay dividends to investors out of after-tax profits, yet these dollars are then subject to another tax: the personal income tax paid by the individuals who receive them. This multiple taxation of dividends discourages investors from finding equity investments that pay a steady stream of income and encourages corporations to retain profits and seek debt financing solely for tax purposes rather than financing their operations with equity. Indeed, these effects may well mean that the tax treatment of dividends is contributing to some of the economy's worst problems, under­scoring the hope that Congress will make the tax treatment of dividends more economically neutral.

This economic neutrality could be achieved in a number of ways. For example, corpora­tions could be allowed to deduct dividend payments from their taxes (just as they do with interest payments), or individual investors could be given tax credits on their personal tax returns using the ""imputation credit"" method. Other countries that have eliminated or reduced the multiple layers of taxation on divi­dends include Australia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Great Britain. All of the possible methods have the same goal: reducing the multiple layers of taxation on cor­porate income.

Consider this example. Assuming a marginal tax rate of 35 percent, for every $100 of pre-tax corporate profits, the federal government initially will take $35. It then will tax the remaining funds again, depending on how much of the $65 the firm decides to pay out as dividends to investors. If the entire $65 were distributed directly to individuals as dividends, the full amount would be taxed as ordinary income to individual investors who receive the dividends. An individual in the 27 percent marginal tax bracket would pay approximately $18 in taxes upon receiving the dividend, leaving only $47 of the original $100 in corporate profits actually paid out to investors. In other words, for every $100 in pre-tax profits, the federal government will take approximately $53-more than half of every dol­lar earned.

Contrary to common perceptions, such double taxation of dividends affects nearly all Americans, not just a select few. As this report will show, most Americans stand to gain from the elimination of the double tax on dividend dollars. The reasons:

dispelling Myths about dividend income

A common misconception is that dividend tax relief would benefit only a select few Americans. Part of the reason has to do with how the IRS clas­sifies ""dividends.""

A recent article by William Gale of the Tax Pol­icy Center, for example, notes that ""just under half-46 percent (93/201)-of dividends paid out of the corporate sector were subject to double tax­ation in 2000."" The ratio mentioned in these cal­culations refers to two measures of dividends: the IRS measure of dividends ($93 billion) and the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) definition of dividends ($201 billion). Interest received from mutual funds is reported as divi­dend income on the IRS 1040 form, and a portion of NIPA dividends includes distributions from S corporations. Neither item is subject to double taxation, but neither item represents dividends.

Regardless of how various types of earned income are classified by the IRS, all real dividends are subject to double taxation. Even when divi­dend-paying equities are held in retirement accounts, they are subject eventually to double taxation.

It can also be argued that the harmful effects of the double taxation of dividends are not simply confined to the real dividends declared on individ­ual tax returns. In fact, the effects of the tax struc­ture are not necessarily confined solely to equity markets. Individuals choose from an array of investment choices based on the real after-tax rate of return they expect. Since all the various invest­ment vehicles are competing for investors' dollars, any material change in one investment's return has to affect the relative return of others. Therefore, the double taxation of dividends indirectly affects the returns of all investments-even those in tax-deferred retirement accounts.

In 2001, nearly $2.4 trillion in retirement plan assets were invested in mutual funds, with roughly a 50/50 split between IRAs and employer-spon­sored retirement plans such as 401(k) plans. Nearly $1.5 trillion of these assets were held in domestic equities. While these equities were held in tax-deferred retirement accounts through mutual funds, at the same time, they were also being held by non-mutual fund and non-retire­ment account investors.

Thus, any given equity investment is likely to be held individually, in mutual funds, and in retire­ment accounts simultaneously. Since dividend tax relief means that firms are more likely to increase their dividend payments, the benefit of this type of tax relief will also accrue to individuals holding equities in retirement accounts even though the benefit will not immediately show up on their tax returns.

Exactly on which tax returns these benefits will appear is another interesting question. By the end of 2000, roughly 42 million U.S. workers with a median annual salary of less than $60,000 partici­pated in a 401(k) plan. Similarly, approximately 42 million U.S. households with a median annual household income of $55,000 (40 percent) owned some type of IRA. Data also show that, as of 2002, nearly 53 million U.S. households (just under 50 percent) held some form of equities and about 84 million individuals owned some form of equities. Given that these equities exist in both retirement and non-retirement accounts, and that the double taxation of dividends affects the relative returns of all investments, it should be clear that eliminating the double taxation of dividends will not benefit only a select few, but rather millions of Americans.

In the post-retirement group, however, the 80th percentile taxpayer reports dividend income in all three filing groups. Table 6 shows that single filers at the 80th percentile, with an after-tax income of $34,740, report dividend income over $6,000; married filers, with after-tax income of about $64,000, have dividend income over $4,000.

Even given this higher proportion of dividend-receiving taxpayers in the post-retirement group, using only the data in Table 1 through Table 6, it is still rather easy to support a claim that only the wealthy will benefit from dividend tax relief. One could argue, for example, that since 80 percent of all taxpayers receive less than $46 in dividends (Table 2, Panel A), dividend tax relief benefits only the upper 20 percent of taxpayers.

A problem with this logic is that the data in these six tables do not distinguish between those taxpayers who receive dividends and those who do not. Therefore, these data do not accurately describe the characteristics of taxpayers who receive dividend income. For this reason, Tables 7 through 12 present summary statistics and percen­tiles using the same groups of taxpayers but exam­ining the data only for taxpayers with dividend income.

The statistics reported in Tables 7 through 12 paint a very different picture. An examination of all dividend-receiving taxpayers (Table 7, Panel A) shows that their median after-tax income is just under $44,000, with dividend income of $478, interest of $435, and capital gains of $220.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Norbert Michel,0.3098039215686275,448902373,1,https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,

The cannabis product tax hike is part of legislation designed to bring in more money to state coffers to offset property tax bills, according to an outline of the plan from Sen. Lou Ann Linehan (R), the legislation's sponsor, that was posted by a Nebraska Public Media reporter.

The legislature's Revenue Committee advanced the underlying measure, LB 388, on a 7-0 vote on Thursday, according to a report in the Nebraska Examiner. The state's full unicameral legislature could take up the bill as soon as Tuesday.

""We are going to tax hemp and CBD at 100%,"" Linehan's document says, adding that, along with other reforms -- including removing sales tax exemptions on soda, candy, pet services, advertising revenue over $1 billion and lottery tickets -- the change is estimated to bring in $182 million in new revenue for the state.

The changes are not currently reflected in the bill's language as available online, nor has any relevant amendment been posted to the bill page. Linehan, who also chairs the panel that approved the measure this week, did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Marijuana Moment.

Adam Morfeld, a former Nebraska state senator who co-chairs the advocacy group Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, reacted to the proposal with shock.

""The Legislature is going to tax hemp and CBD at 100 percent!??"" he posted on social media.

Gov. Jim Pillen (R) praised the committee for approving the tax legislation, congratulating members in a press release for ""advancing historic and transformational property tax relief and reform.""

""Thank you for delivering once in a lifetime transformational property tax relief plan to all Nebraskans,"" he said.

Self-described ""conservative Republican"" Sen. Julie Slama, meanwhile, said she's ""100% opposed"" to the bill, claiming the overall proposal would be largest tax increase in Nebraska's history.

The proposal comes as the state, like many others across the country, witnesses an explosion of hemp-derived products, including intoxicating cannabinoids such as delta-8 THC. Late last year, the state's attorney general, Mike Hilgers (R), filed suit against retailers in the state over their sale of delta-8 products.

Both medical and adult-use of marijuana remain illegal in Nebraska, though advocates are hoping to change that through a ballot measure they're working to put on November's ballot.

A recent poll by the campaign found 70 percent support in the state for legalizing medical marijuana.

Organizers at Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana (NMM) have been petitioning for the change since July, about two months after turning in a pair of complementary ballot proposals to the secretary of state's office.

Gov. Jim Pillen (R) has already voiced opposition to the reform effort, saying in September that legalization ""poses demonstrated harms to our children,"" and that medical cannabis should only be accessible if its approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Late last year, NMM told Marijuana Moment that the governor's argument was a ""cop out,"" and she says the campaign will let voters decide for themselves.

One of NMM's earlier campaigns gathered enough signatures for ballot placement in 2020, but the measure was invalidated by the state Supreme Court following a single-subject challenge. Supporters then came up short on signatures for revised petitions in 2022 due in large part to the loss of funding after one of their key donors died in a plane crash.

Nebraska lawmakers, including campaign co-chair Sen. Anna Wishart (D), have also attempted to enact the reform legislatively, but cannabis bills have consistently stalled out in the conservative legislature.

Wishart's medical cannabis bill received a hearing in the unicameral Judiciary Committee in February, but it did not advance. She attributed the inaction to changes in committee membership.

This comes as the authority announced on March 20 that garden waste collections are changing to a paid subscription service from May 1.

The changes will bring the city in line with most councils across England, including neighbouring authorities. Residents will need to opt in online and pay an annual fee of £35.

They have said this is too much, however, as the cost of living crisis is still making its presence felt. Some said that they would rather take their waste to a recycling centre themselves and not have to pay the new tax.

Should Nottingham City Council have managed its finances better over the last 10 years?

Rohey Sonko, 42 and from St Ann's, said: ""I wouldn't pay the charge, I'd rather not have the bin. We don't use it that much anyway, just when we cut the grass, so we'll just take it to the recycling centre.""

Neighbour Aboubacar Sylla, 30, echoed the opinion. He said: ""My garden is low maintenance so I don't use the bin that much. I'll just take whatever waste to the recycling centre.

""If I had a bigger garden, I think I'd keep the bin, but it's quite small."" Another St Ann's resident, who wished to keep her identity private, added: ""I don't agree with the new charge.

""I think we're paying enough in council tax as it is and they're always putting it up anyway. It's not right because people are struggling. We don't use the bin a lot anyway because we don't have a large garden.

""Things would be easier if we had a car and could take the waste to a recycling centre so I guess we'll have to wait and see what we decide to do. We're just trying to save money all the time, aren't we?""

Martin Archer, 53, also of St Ann's, said that although he does not agree with paying extra, he understands the council ""has to get money from somewhere"". Another resident who wished to remain anonymous added: ""If I had to pay it, I would.

""The money that the council lost, they obviously need to make up. I'm prepared to pay that charge if it's going to stop the old people losing out on things, for example. I don't think it's too expensive either for a yearly tax.""

There will be a discount for any additional garden bins at a property, and households receiving council tax benefit can get the service for £17.50. Residents who do not already have a garden waste bin will also need to pay an additional one-off cost of £25 for delivery.

The collection service will run from April to November, with fortnightly collections taking place until September, and then monthly collections in October and November. Garden waste can be taken for free to the Household Waste and Recycling Centre on Redfield Road, Lenton.

The amount of federal excise duty on petroleum products in the fiscal year 2023 was 0.7 per cent of the GDP, while for other items, it was 0.4 per cent of the GDP, mainly obtained from the federal excise duty on cigarettes.

The Petroleum Development Levy has undergone several changes in recent years, but there was a significant increase in it in fiscal year 2023.

It has been proposed to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in the country, such as yachts, while enhancing border control. This is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of petroleum byproducts from sensitive areas in particular.

According to reports, an increase in federal excise duty (FED) at a uniform rate on domestically manufactured cigarettes has been recommended by the IMF. There is also a proposal to apply the same tax rate to imported cigarettes as local cigarettes.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that the financially beleaguered nation needed another long-term bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise its fragile economy, ARY News reported.

""A new tranche of loan is likely to be received from the IMF in a few days, however, we would need another programme,"" he said while addressing the session of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) apex committee attended by civil-military leadership.

The comments came a day after the IMF agreed to a staff-level agreement with Islamabad which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion under an existing USD 3 billion standby arrangement.

He said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the review for issuance of the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion which hopefully be received by next month.

New Delhi [India], March 23 (ANI): Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra accused the Congress on Saturday of not complying with income tax rules, leading to the freezing of their bank accounts.

""In 2017-18, the Congress broke two rules. It missed the extended deadline and exceeded the limit of cash donations. Under Rule 13A, it is clearly mentioned that if these rules are not complied with, the provision for exemptions will be withdrawn. So, in the nomenclature of income tax, the Congress party is defined as an 'association of persons,' and it would be subjected to normal tax liability,"" Patra said at a press conference on Saturday.

The BJP leader noted that all parties receive some exemption in taxes under the provisions of the Constitution.

""All political parties, under the rules of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, are granted an exemption in tax. This is a constitutional provision in India. No parties are discriminated against. The Congress, BJP, and TMC are treated the same,"" he explained.

Explaining why the Congress' accounts were frozen, Patra pointed out that the Congress had missed the extended deadline for paying their tax returns for 2017-18 by December 2018 and paid their taxes only in February 2019.

""Why were Congress' accounts frozen? The assessment for FY 2017-18 was evaluated in 2018-19. The tax had to be collected on the Congress party's business, donations of 2017-18, which had to be paid within the tax return deadline. There is also an extended deadline, and if we do not pay taxes within that date, we have to pay a penalty,"" the senior BJP leader explained.

""The Congress party had an extended deadline of December 31, 2018, to pay their tax return. But the Congress party did not comply with this. They paid their tax return in February 2019,"" Patra further clarified.

Patra also highlighted that the Congress party exceeded the stipulated limit of cash donations and received donations worth Rs 14 lakhs in cash.

""Secondly, any political party cannot accept cash donations of more than Rs 20,000. But when the Congress party's accounts for 2017-18 were assessed in 2018-19, it was found that they had not complied with this rule.

(CNN) -- The Senate passed a government funding package early Saturday morning, averting a partial shutdown and ending a lengthy fight that has loomed over both sides of Capitol Hill for months.

The legislation will next be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, which he's expected to do Saturday.

The vote marks a major moment on Capitol Hill as it brings to a close an annual appropriations process that has dragged on far longer than is typical - an effort that has been punctuated by partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

While final passage came after the midnight deadline, the Senate's action effectively prevented any lapse in funding or government function, and the federal government is now funded through the end of the fiscal year.

The Senate's vote comes after the end of a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill, highlighting how narrow the majorities are in both chambers are and how high tensions are running among lawmakers. Immediately after the House voted to pass the legislation the Senate is considering, firebrand Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to oust Johnson from the speakership. While the resolution does not need to be addressed immediately, it represents the most formal and strident challenge to the speaker's leadership since he took over in late last year. The final House vote was 286-134, with 112 Republicans and 22 Democrats voting against.

Despite the House voting earlier in the day Friday, voting in the Senate was delayed for hours amid negotiations over an agreement to speed passage in the chamber. Republicans had demanded votes on controversial amendments that put some vulnerable Senate Democrats in tough political spots.

The funding bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Lawmakers unveiled the $1.2 trillion government funding package just before 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, and the text is more than 1,000 pages long.

Schumer said Thursday that the text for the legislative package came ""in the nick of time,"" with fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown. The Democratic leader added, ""Now Congress must now race to pass this package before government funding runs out this Friday. Once the House acts, the Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday's deadline and avoid a shutdown,"" a reference to how any one senator could slow passage of the bill and launch a partial shutdown.

After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year.

Johnson, who won the gavel after McCarthy's ouster, faces an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight. With the House starting a two-week recess on Friday, Greene's resolution to oust Johnson will hang over the GOP conference as it considers what to do next in the 118th Congress.

Johnson praised the bill early Thursday morning, outlining conservative wins in the package.

""This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,"" Johnson said in a statement.

House members on both sides of the aisle lashed out Thursday over the agreement, with progressives and far-right members criticizing the legislation for different reasons.

GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN he won't be supporting any Republican who votes for the bill and that leadership ""owns the bill,"" describing the bill as a ""failure.""

""I would have a very difficult time doing that,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju. ""The Republican conference is a failure if they pass this bill.""

House progressives have also been critical with some indicating they will vote against it over provisions that will withhold funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for one year amid the alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack against Israel.

McCarthy's fate has raised questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership, but many Republicans have made clear they do not want another speaker's race after the intense infighting and chaos triggered by McCarthy's removal.

The separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.",wishtv.com,news,WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic,"Haley Talbot, Clare Foran",-0.0980392156862745,448901143,1,https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbHUxbzYybm0wMDAxM2I2aXd4NmR2ZGpl-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NsdTFvM3I3czAwMGsyNnFtOHFqajRrMjU.jpg,eng-9411206

Although the meeting was intended to be informational, tribal, Navajo EPA and community leaders expressed their uncertainty about whether the federal government will actually start addressing the cleanup of the abandoned uranium mines that landed the site on the EPA list, also known as the Superfund program.

The mining district encompasses Navajo Nation communities of Cove, Round Rock and Lukachukai in the far northeastern corner of Arizona.

""We are looking at what happened in the past and how the federal government could have prevented a lot of this contamination,"" said Council Delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty, ""could've prevented our community from getting sick. What I don't want them (children) to have to deal with is another three or four decades before actual action happens.""

Phil Harrison remembers when his childhood community of Cove was alive with family gatherings, ceremonies, rodeos, farming and ranching, but after decades of uranium contamination, those days are a thing of the past.

""There is no more farming, orchards, family gatherings and Cove is really empty,"" said Harrison. ""Scarred by the negligence of the federal government leaving all these contaminants behind.""

Harrison's father was a miner in the uranium mines of Cove, which was where uranium was first discovered on the Navajo Nation. Uranium production in the northern and western Carrizo Mountains of the Navajo Nation began in 1948, peaked in 1955 and 1956 and declined to zero again by 1967.

After mining in unventilated mines for over 20 years, Harrison's father died of lung cancer. His grandfather, who was also a rancher in Cove, died of cancer, and so did his uncles. Many of those living in the community recall similar experiences and see the effects today.

""The rain and snow kept washing these contaminated waste out into these washes,"" said Harrison. ""A lot of people were exposed to uranium and I know many families that engage in their father's mining history and they have cancers.""

Superfund listing took years of lobbying by Navajo officials

The Lukachukai Mountains Mining District includes 100 mine waste piles from past mining contaminated with radium-226, uranium and other heavy metals.

Waste from the piles ran downstream in washes and contaminated groundwater and continues to affect the water source, Harrison said. According to the EPA, past ore hauling activities may have spread contamination along miles of mountainous haul roads.

""I think by now a lot of people don't farm anymore because the washes are all contaminated,"" said Harrison. ""They should actually do core drilling, core testing, like every mile down the stream all the way out to the main runoff into the San Juan River. With that amount of time I'm sure it contaminated the whole wash basin in the area.""

Although the last Navajo administration had supported placing the mining district on the Superfund list, getting attention and funding to clean up the area has been decades in the making.

""When I learned about this proposal, which was initiated in the prior administration, we were supportive of it right away,"" said Navajo EPA director Stephan Benally. ""But there was questions based on my experience.""

Benally gave a quick timeline of his years working on getting funding and assistance from the federal government to address the abandoned uranium mines. He was first made Navajo EPA director in 2003 and was in that role for 12 years. He came back on as director in 2022. He said the Navajo Nation had gone to Congress in the late 1990s to ask for help and funding to address abandoned uranium mines.

Cove school:Parents want a decision about plans to replace a Navajo school near old uranium mines

In 2012, he said they decided to get involved in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. lawsuit. In 2014, the U.S. District Court approved an almost $1 billion settlement through the U.S. EPA to investigate and clean up 50 uranium mines operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation on or near the Navajo Nation.

From the late 1940s to the 1980s, Kerr-McGee Corporation mined upward of 7 million tons of uranium ore on or near the Navajo Nation. About 32 of these mines are located in the Cove.

""Those are some of the few battle scars I have,"" said Benally. ""And other experiences that have all been a part of the background for today's events.""

Listing is 'a guarantee from the United States' of the site's cleanup

Cliff Villa, from the Land and Emergency Management Office for the U.S. EPA, had worked on the Coeur D'Alene Mining District in Idaho, which was the richest silver district ever discovered in America and where major mining operations continued for over 100 years. It is also the site of one of the biggest Superfund cleanup projects.

He said he had worked alongside the Coeur D'Alene tribe to get resources for the cleanup and he will soon visit there again in celebration of a successful cleanup.

""We are here celebrating the beginning of a process,"" said Villa. ""The National Priorities List is a guarantee from the United States that this community will be a national priority for the EPA. It is a promise. We are here and we are here to stay in partnership.""

Kenyon Larsen, the remedial project manager for the Lukachukai Mountain Mining District listing, said the Cove mountain has numerous mines, some of which are funded by the Kerr-McGee settlement, now connected to that company's successor, Tronox.

""There are a lot of holes which means there are a lot of waste piles,"" said Larsen. ""Which means there was a district that was created with lots of different points of contamination and that was an opportunity to list another mining district on the National Priorities listing.""

Harrison is a member of the Navajo Nation Uranium Radiation Victims Committee, which was founded in the late 1970s. For decades, Harrison and this group have been championing the expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, persisting in their efforts despite limited resources.

Although they are working to aid Navajo uranium miners, they receive no financial assistance from the tribal government. Through the lobbying endeavors of this group, the Senate passed S3853, allocating funds for the compensation act and prolonging its duration for another six years. It also broadens the eligibility for funding for people exposed to radiation, among other provisions.

""We actually witnessed the voting in the gallery,"" said Harrison. ""The senators took an hour to vote on this and it was really something to witness. We lobbied like crazy.""

Harrison is also battling his own health issues as a result of being a miner and working as a remediation specialist.

He said when he started working as a miner in 1969 at the John Brown Uranium Mine in Gateway, Colo., he was given a shovel with no other information about how dangerous uranium mining would be. When his dad was a uranium miner in the mountains of Cove he said he too was never told of the health dangers.

""These companies never gave the community back anything that would be sustainable,"" said Harrison. ""I think I only seen two steel picnic tables that was signed off by Kerr-McGee at Red Valley chapter that's the only thing we got from the companies and federal government. They should initiate some kind of farming initiative in a safe manner or build a bug gymnasium for our young people. The companies just left and never looked back.""",azcentral.com,news,AZ Central,,-0.1294117647058823,448900771,1,"https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/presto/2019/10/29/PPHX/914ded86-16ba-455a-8d5c-abb63941f9ca-EPA.jpg?crop=3761,2116,x0,y168&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",

Makinde stated this in an interview on Channels Television's Politics Today on Friday.

The governor faulted 16 governors' submission of a report on the matter to the National Economic Council (NEC).

Recall that on Thursday, NEC confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police to address the myriads of security challenges facing the nation.

But, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Makinde said, ""I did not submit any memorandum on state police but my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time.

""I did not submit not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde said the issue of the state police can best be handled by the National Assembly and not the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

The governor said, ""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work. It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly and then at the state level, we get our state houses of assembly to pass this law.""

The calls for state police has been an age-long issue in Nigeria. But the worsening state of security in the country has heightened such calls.

Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on February 12 restated their position on state policing, as the solution to the country's worsening security situation.

Regional socio-political groups such as Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, and the Northern Elders' Forum, have repeatedly called for state police as a solution to the nation's increasing security challenges.

Some states in the South-West geopolitical zone have formed the Amotekun while their counterparts in the South-East also created a security outfit Ebube Agu.

The Benue Guards has also been operational in Benue State in the North Central while states like Katsina, Zamfara, and other bandit-prone sub-nationals have also come up with similar state-established outfits.

The outfits, however, are still seeking the backing of the Federal Government.

States continue to demand that Amotekun, Ebube Agu, and others be granted license to bear assault rifles like AK-47s to confront insurgents. - vanguard",realnewsmagazine.net,news,Realnews Magazine,,-0.003921568627450966,448900538,1,https://realnewsmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-667.png,

PAN Card Blacklisted? Here's How You Can File Your ITR, Check","Income Tax News: The Income Tax Department has mandated that Aadhaar and PAN cards be linked. The PAN cards of those who failed to link them before to that date have had their cards deleted. This deadline expired last year. The PAN card closure causes a lot of issues for taxpayers.

Importance of PAN Card for Income Tax Filing

A taxpayer's PAN card is needed in order to file their income tax return. You may be wondering how to file an ITR at this point if you did not link your PAN with Aadhaar by the deadline and your PAN stops working. Without a PAN card, submitting taxes can be challenging, but it is still feasible.

Filing Taxes with Aadhaar Instead of PAN

If your PAN card isn't working, you can still file your taxes using Aadhaar. The process of submitting income tax returns will now pick up steam as the new fiscal year begins on April 1. Income tax returns for the current fiscal year, which concludes on March 31, must be filed by July 31. In other words, taxpayers who do not require an audit can file an ITR until July 31, 2024, without incurring a penalty, for the fiscal year 2023-2024 (assessment year 2024-25).

Filing ITR with Aadhaar OTP

Taxpayers can use the Aadhaar OTP to file an ITR if their PAN is not active. With the aid of Aadhaar OTP authentication, an ITR can be filed in the event of a closed PAN. After that, taxpayers will need to create an electronic verification code using an alternate method -- such as online banking or an ATM -- in order to validate the return.

You will run into issues with it if your refund is being processed. The Income Tax Department had made it quite clear that taxpayers whose PAN is not connected to Aadhaar will not be able to obtain their income tax refund. June 30, 2023 was the date for integrating PAN with Aadhaar. PAN and Aadhaar can still be connected, but there would be a cost to the taxpayer.",dnpindia.in,news,DNP INDIA,Sparsh Goel,-0.01960784313725494,448900226,21,https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Income-Tax-News-10-1.webp,eng-9420294

For too long property taxes have been on autopilot, and injecting more transparency into local government budgeting will be beneficial.

Property taxes are a top concern for many Iowans. The growing frustration over high property taxes surpasses political party identification and the urban-rural divide. As part of the transformational 2023 property tax reform law local governments in Iowa will now be required to send taxpayers a detailed budget and tax notice.

Some local government officials are opposed to sending the budget and tax notices making the argument that they cost too much and are unnecessary. Why should local governments be opposed to providing greater transparency? Citizen engagement and knowledge is the key to better communities and lower property tax bills. When it comes to property taxes, silence only encourages local governments to keep increasing their spending.

The budget and tax notices are a form of direct notification, which is part of Truth-in-Taxation. Truth-in-Taxation is the gold standard for property tax reform laws. For decades Utah has had a strong Truth-in-Taxation law, which has been successful in not only providing tax relief, but also forcing more transparency and accountability upon local governments. Utah's law has served as a model for other states. Iowa taxpayers deserve greater transparency and accountability from local governments and direct notification will provide much needed sunlight on budgeting.

By late March, county auditors will be required to send to each taxpayer a budget and tax notice. The notices will include detailed budget and tax information from all taxing authorities. Taxpayers will also be able to see an example of how a potential increase will impact their property tax bill. Further, if a taxing authority wants to exceed current spending levels, then it must justify why an increase is needed and what the additional programs or services will the taxpayers dollars be used. Finally, the date, time, and location of the taxing authority's budget hearing must be listed within the statement.

It is estimated that the budget and tax notices will cost $1.9 million, or $1.50 per notice. Local government officials who are critical of the notices are arguing that they are not only unnecessary because the information that they will provide is already available and they are a waste of taxpayer dollars. Both accounts are not true.

First, not all taxing authorities provide the same information, and the property tax statements that do provide some of the information arrive after local governments have passed their budgets and it is too late for citizens to act. As an example, existing notices do not justify why additional spending is needed. Second, as to the argument that the notices are a waste of taxpayer dollars, evidence from Utah demonstrates that this is not a financial hardship for local governments. It actually serves the interest of the taxpayer.

In fiscal year 2020 local governments in Iowa collected over $6 billion in property taxes from taxpayers. Local governments continue to collect more from taxpayers. Over the past 20 years, property taxes have grown over 110%

Utah demonstrates that the Truth-in-Taxation budget hearings actually lead to property tax relief. The purpose of the budget and tax notices is to inform taxpayers and encourage them to participate in their local government budget hearings. These budget hearings force more ""sunlight"" on the local government budget process, and it requires public officials to justify to taxpayers why they want to increase spending. The evidence from Utah clearly shows that they empower taxpayers.

John and Ben Maguire, of Greenbreak Limited, applied to Cavan County Council last August to turn their farm into a commercially run operation at Ballaghanna, Mountnugent.

A works initially outlined provided for demolition works and the construction of a new portal frame shed to allow for the storage of green waste compost.

The father and son duo also detailed plans to change the use of an existing cattle shed to store the plant's end product.

In order to facilitate the move, consultants drew up plans to raise its roof by a near 10ft alongside moves to develop concrete and gravel yards to meet outdoor windrow composting and allow vehicles to turn safely.

In a planner's report, Cavan County Council stated how the pair currently farm at the site of the proposed development and also compost at the site in a private capacity, processing 150 tonnes of green waste annually.

""They propose to develop this into a commercial operation which would require the acceptance of green waste from external sources,"" said executive planner Fintan Coffey.

The proposed development, which is located in an unzoned and ""open countryside"" location, will provisionally process 600 tonnes of green waste in its first 12 months of operation increasing to a maximum of 3000 tonnes by year five.

An outdoor windrow system capable of carrying out a 14-week decomposition process was also included in order to allow for the final product to be sold as an organic soil conditioner.

The madness of March can mean different things to different people.

My son and I have been feverishly comparing brackets. (Scroll down to see how many brackets remained perfect as of Friday evening.)

My daughters? They were counting the days until Taylor Swift released her ERAS Tour movie last week.

And tax professionals? Many of them are working long hours to get returns pushed out by Tax Day -- there are just 24 days remaining.

If you're working on your return, you're not alone: most -- about 52% -- of e-filed returns have been self-prepared. That number is dropping as the season progresses, which isn't unusual. Professionally prepared returns accounted for 29,644,000 of e-filed returns received so far in 2024. That's according to recent tax filing season data, which also indicates that, as of March 8, 2024, the IRS had received 62,761,000 tax returns, about 49% of the expected total for the year. (☆)

If you are tackling your return, you may be ready to pull your hair out over the complexity of the rules -- including those that seemingly change every other year, like the entertainment and meal tax deduction, the mileage tax deduction, and deductions targeted to small businesses.

You may also be worried about those receipts (don't panic -- as a last resort, the Cohan rule allows taxpayers to prove by ""other credible evidence"" that they actually incurred deductible expenses).

And if you're looking at your tax bill and wondering how you might be able to avoid a similar result next year, maybe it's time to reconsider asset location. That doesn't mean literally moving the physical location of your investments to say, Cleveland -- it means thinking about how your funds are invested. You might be able to save yourself tens of thousands of dollars by reshuffling positions between taxable and tax-sheltered accounts, like IRAs.

There's no doubt that it can be a fairly stressful time of year (even without those basketball brackets in the back of your mind).

I spent some time this week talking with tax professionals about how taxpayers can ease some of the associated stress. It likely won't surprise you that they suggested you ask for help. One place to start? Hire a bookkeeper. There are obvious reasons to seek out help, like tax savings, but don't discount longer-term benefits, like reducing your audit risk. Nicole Davis, the founder and CEO of Butler-Davis Tax & Accounting, explains that the IRS and other tax authorities rely on data metrics. That means the IRS is comparing you to other businesses in your category. You can raise red flags by mischaracterizing one expense -- say, advertising -- as another expense -- like travel -- because it might not make sense for your business category. And beyond taxes, Jenny Groberg, CEO of BookSmarts Accounting and Bookkeeping, says business owners should consider it an investment. There will be a cost, but it's worth asking yourself, ""How much more money can I make?"" (☆)

You may also want to consider hiring an accountant or other tax preparer. When is the right time for the do-it-yourselfer to pay someone else to take the reins on their yearly tax filing? There is no specific trigger for when you should turn over your taxes to an accountant, but some signs, like repeated mistakes, may be telling you it's time. One of the terms that popped up over and over in many of these conversations was fractional CFO. Healy Jones, VP of Financial Strategy at Kruze Consulting -- a New York CPA firm specializing in startup accounting and finance -- explained that a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) can bring a lot to the table, like experience and industry expertise, but the price tag can be financially difficult for some businesses. He says a fractional CFO may be the solution. (☆)

It's refund season, which means a lot of taxpayers are checking with the IRS to see when a check might hit their account. Unfortunately, if you owe a tax debt, your refund is typically withheld and applied to the tax due. But the IRS can't do that indefinitely -- there are limits on how long they may collect.

That's exactly the question that a reader asked this week. The reader wrote, in part:

I had a tax debt and was not getting my refunds due to it, which I understand. This year is the first time in over 10 years that we received our refund. Is the 10-year cutoff valid? I read that after 10 years the IRS writes off the debt if not paid. Online it also shows that I have 0 balance.

It's a great question. Collections statutes can be tricky because they have a lot of moving parts.

To understand collections status, you have to understand a few additional terms. One of those is an assessment. An assessment occurs when the IRS officially records your tax liability. The IRS has three years from the date that the IRS received your original tax return or three years from the due date of the original return, whichever is later, to assess individual taxes (some exceptions apply). For most taxpayers, the assessment date is date the return is accepted -- unless you're audited, which rarely happens. (☆)

(If you have an online account with the IRS, you can see when your return has been recorded as filed, as well as any additional assessment dates. Note that transcripts for all years are not available online.)

You'll have a new assessment date if you file an amended return. Ditto in the case of an exam or audit where additional tax may be assessed. Some penalties, like failure to pay, as well as interest, may also have separate assessment dates. That means you could have multiple assessment dates for the same return since a new assessment date would apply to the increased amount of tax.

The assessment date is important because the clock doesn't start running on collections until then. The IRS generally has 10 years to collect taxes after the assessment date. Once that window has closed, the agency may not continue to collect.

(That information should appear on your transcript -- you'll see an example from the IRS above.)

One important note: the IRS does have some wiggle room in that 10-year window. The time to collect can be extended if you take certain steps -- some common moves that can push the date out include requesting an installment agreement (typically, the window stretches while you're waiting to have it reviewed), filing for bankruptcy (while the bankruptcy is pending), or submitting an Offer in Compromise (while the offer is reviewed). You can find some more detailed examples from the IRS here.

And one last note: You stated that you had checked your balance online. That's a smart move. I highly recommend checking your online account for notices, balances, and tax information.

Do you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter? We'd love to help if we can. Check out our guidelines and submit a question here.

U.S. income tax is your total federal income tax liability, which includes the alternative minimum tax (AMT), less all credits against income tax, and does not include payroll or self-employment taxes.

According to IRS data, just over one-third (37.4%) of the 164.4 million tax returns filed for 2020 had zero or negative U.S. income tax liability, and 94.2% had adjusted gross income (AGI) of $50,000 or less. These numbers are a bit skewed compared to other years because they include temporary provisions that offset the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

To be considered taxable, a return had to have a positive income tax liability after accounting for all credits. A nontaxable return, on the other hand, could have either a zero or negative income tax liability after accounting for all credits, including refundable credits.

According to the IRS, the charitable contributions deduction was the most important item in eliminating the tax on returns without any worldwide income tax and with an AGI of $200,000 or more in 2020. Total miscellaneous deductions, medical and dental expense deductions, and all other taxes, were next.

We're always talking about privacy in my house (full disclosure: my husband is a privacy lawyer, also, we're nerdy that way). That's why I was super interested to read that the IRS may be walking some fine lines with its Direct File website. The pilot program contains Google Analytics JavaScript code and a more covert tracking mechanism called canvas fingerprinting. Those tools, which you may be familiar with, offer valuable insights into user behavior -- businesses may use them to enhance functionality, improve user support, and figure out what outreach campaigns are most effective. But there may be a difference between what you expect from a private business website and the government, raising questions about the ethical use of tracking technologies and the balance being struck by the IRS between user experience and privacy.

Also raising interest in the tech and business worlds? Whether the Senate will ever vote on the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024. While discussions about the bipartisan bill -- which overwhelmingly passed the House -- typically involve the expanded child tax credit, there are also several corporate-friendly provisions. Those include the reinstitution of immediate expensing for domestic research expenditures, increasing bonus depreciation for qualified property to 100%, and allowing for the interest expense limitation to be based on 30% of adjusted taxable income before depreciation and amortization. While all three of these provisions are familiar to the business community, they have been limited over the past couple of years. Businesses want to know: will the Senate bring them back? Stay tuned.

DAFs are giving accounts established at public charities. When you donate to a DAF, you are generally eligible for an immediate tax deduction even if the funds aren't immediately turned over to charity. The funds are typically invested, and you can make grant recommendations to any qualified public charity.

The comments focus on ensuring that the Final Regs are consistent with the treatment of similarly-situated accounts, do not duplicate existing penalty tax regimes, and do not unintentionally complicate the ongoing operation and administration of DAFs and similar arrangements.

Grant Thornton LLP, which offers audit and assurance, tax, and advisory services, has announced ""a significant growth investment"" with New Mountain Capital, LLC. It is the second private equity investment announcement from a top 10 firm this year -- earlier in 2024, I noted that Baker Tilly had announced a significant investment from private equity firms Hellman & Friedman and Valeas Capital Partners. Following the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the second calendar quarter of 2024, the firm's structure will reflect that Grant Thornton LLP, a licensed CPA firm, will provide attest services, and Grant Thornton Advisors LLC will provide business advisory and non-attest services.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association -- or NCAA -- is a tax-exempt organization headquartered in which state?

I hope you'll get to know some of our staff and contributors. In honor of March Madness, I asked: Who do you have winning the men's tourney in March Madness?

Kelly Phillips Erb (Senior Writer, Tax): ACC all the way! I picked Duke, but woudn't be sad to see NCSU or UNC make a run at it.

Hank Tucker (Writer, Money Team): Duke... And if not them I'd love to see the Wolfpack win a miraculous five more in a row.

Matt Schifrin (Executive Editor, Money): I did an auto bracket via ESPN analysts. They picked Creighton but I changed it to Huskies versus Houston, with Huskies winning. I picked them mostly because I am a dog lover.

That's how many perfect brackets remained in ESPN's Men's Tournament Challenge as of Friday evening. That compares to 22,114,064 brackets which have fallen, nearly 100%. If your bracket does well enough to win your office pool -- or beat the odds in Vegas -- your winnings will be taxable. Gambling winnings are taxable for federal income tax purposes, whether between friends, online, or in a casino. They're even taxable if betting isn't legal in your jurisdiction (just ask Al Capone).

The NCAA was established in 1906 in New York City and moved around a bit, including stops in Chicago and Kansas City. It moved to its current headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1999.

Map shows every state's grade,"(NEXSTAR) -- Tax season isn't really fun for anyone, but some states' residents have it harder than others this time of year.

As families around the country collect their paperwork and get ready to file, people in Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa and New Jersey may find themselves with a heftier tax bill than their neighbors in other states.

An updated analysis by MoneyGeek, a personal finance site, evaluates how ""tax friendly"" each state is by calculating the tax burden on the average citizen. States with low tax burdens earned an A, while those with the highest tax burden earned Fs.

The state that scored worst overall was Illinois, where taxes represent about 13% of a median family's income.

Unsurprisingly, the states with no state income taxes at all ended up scoring pretty highly. Those eight states are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.

But in some of those states, higher sales tax rates or property tax rates are in place to make up for the lower income tax revenue. Tennessee and Washington have some of the highest sales tax rates in the country, the Tax Foundation says.

According to the updated MoneyGeek analysis, the most ""tax friendly"" state overall was Nevada, where the median family owes about 4% of its income in taxes.

Meanwhile, 13 states earned either a D or F grade for tax burdens. For some of those states, like Oregon, high personal income tax rates are to blame. In others, like Illinois, high property taxes are a major factor. New Jersey, which earned an F from MoneyGeek, residents have a double whammy of high income and property taxes.

The states with the highest top personal income tax rates are California, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon and Minnesota, TurboTax reports, but that doesn't necessarily mean people in those states are getting hit hardest in the end. Each of those states has its own complex set of rules of tax credits, deductions and income floors to pay any state taxes at all.

To conduct the study, MoneyGeek looked at how much a hypothetical family would pay in taxes if they were a married couple with one dependent, a gross income of $94,003 (the median national income at the time of research), and a home worth about $320,900 (the median price of a new home). The lower the taxes on this hypothetical average family, the better the grade.

MoneyGeek's system of grading states on tax burden only holds true for that hypothetical family. A family who just bought a $1.5 million house in California would probably be paying a lot more in taxes, while a single person who earns $40,000 and is a renter in Texas would pay less.

In particular, the department's checks relate to compliance with the tax obligations of both the monastery itself and the individuals involved in the case under consideration.

Five monks at the monastery have currently been suspended by the Holy Synod, while suspect economic activity has been drawn into question by both the church and police since the outbreak of a number of scandals at the beginning of March.

Income to the monastery is being investigated, while questions have been raised about business activities being conducted at the monastery.

On Friday it emerged that the monastery applied for a €3 million fundraiser to the interior ministry in 2020. However, it never submitted any of the necessary financial statements afterwards.

The application, aimed at collecting money to expand the monastery, was rubberstamped by the Tamassos Bishopric.

This was presented by our National Treasury CS at the Africa Fiscal Monitor Forum organised by our great navigator and guide, the IMF.

The CS justified it by stating he had through computer simulation, found that the absence of tax on milk was not helping the poor but only benefiting the middle-class who bought milk and bread in supermarkets.

So, he wants to tax not only the middle-class but all the poor also? This is not logic. He was silent about the rich. He knows the rich acquire their milk and bread as entitlement and manna from heaven, and pay neither price nor tax.

Is our economics team serious and so without embarrassment in talking like this without compassion and concern for the country? Or are they only showing the IMF and the diplomatic community (and themselves), how clever they are with exotic solutions which no one else has thought up. Supermarkets? Have these so-called pundits heard of kiosks, where millions of Kenyans buy their milk and bread in all 47 counties?

Computer simulation can also show us that we can also increase resources by bringing corruption down by 90 per cent, by daily rounding up a random 100 Kenyans in each county and then without trial or hearing, executing them in public by firing squad. We could say trials are not benefiting the innocent poor, but only the guilty middle class who can afford clever lawyers from legal supermarkets. Again, we would not mention the rich, who neither get tried nor found guilty. I could help the IMF organise such an Africa Rule of Law Monitor Forum. Gratis.

If a Milk and Bread VAT tax is even thought up for consideration by our economics team, which includes Rhodes scholars in economics and our ex-World Bank wizards, both categories supposedly holding expertise of the highest order, it brings shame on our nation. It is the greatest danger to our children, particularly of poor parents, a precursor of malnutrition in generations of our infants, a decimation of our primary school system and debilitation of a healthy work force.

Treasury should take a careful look at the actual poverty and the absence of enough milk and bread in our children nation-wide, rural and urban, and then look in the mirror. You are leaders to find solutions consistent with the protection of your people, not to crush them because your supposed outstanding intellectual past but present non-performance cannot rise enough to find sane alternative resources.

Already, ""Two-thirds of Kenyans even on permanent jobs [like teachers and civil servants] are taking up side hustles to cope with the tough economic times."" (Tala credit survey, Business Daily, 21 March 2024). One major medical crisis in the family makes the economic situation a danger. And the CS wants to tax them on key necessities like milk and bread?

All the above shows this regime does not have any long-term planning for development. Or a tax policy within such a plan. This impacts directly on our methods of raising revenue, and the limits of taxation. It explains our ad hoc and distracted search for anything to tax. The regime does not know why it is in power, save to enrich individuals. Its promise to a large number of voters including boda bodas, has failed.

This government's own report (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2024) states, ""The number of new motorcycle purchases has slumped to the lowest level since 2008 as high taxes and sky-rocketing fuel prices"", the imposition of VAT on fuel, and the risen cost of credit have all cut motorcycle purchases to less than half of those in 2022.""

This evidence shows the business no longer benefits riders as it used to, despite campaign promises, and 50 per cent fewer riders are entering the business. Riders and their families do not buy milk in supermarkets. And the CS wants to tax them on milk and bread?

Marie Antoinette the Queen of France just before the French Revolution (1789) was told of the demand by the poor of France for bread. Her famous reply was, ""Let them eat cakes.""

Chicago voters rejected the referendum, backed by Mayor Brandon Johnson, that would have incrementally raised the city's real estate transfer tax on properties valued at more than $1 million. The measure would've also lowered the transfer tax for properties under $1 million, which comprise the majority of property sales in the city.

While the defeat of the measure, referred to as ""Bring Chicago Home,"" was seen as a referendum on Mayor Johnson's administration, what it represented, had it passed, was a city-generated revenue source to address the unrelenting issue of homelessness in Chicago, supporters say.

In a city where Black Chicagoans make up more than half (53%) of the total population experiencing homelessness, the transfer tax would have generated $100 million for mental health services, job training and educational opportunities for the unhoused, its proponents say.

However, opponents of the tax, especially local real estate and business groups, said that it unfairly targeted commercial businesses. Those opponents, which comprised the Building Owners and Managers Association and others, initially sued the city's Board of Elections to remove the referendum from March 19 ballots. However, an appeals court overturned the decision, and the Illinois Supreme Court declined their motion for appeal.

Though the measure was defeated, its supporters vowed to keep fighting.

On Friday night, the coalition behind Bring Chicago Home issued a statement after the Associated Press called the results:

""In 2017, a group of Chicago Coalition for the Homeless grassroots leaders with lived experience of homelessness first developed the idea of what became Bring Chicago Home. Since that first day, we have collectively fought for the revenue we need to provide the permanent housing and services the people experiencing homelessness in Chicago need.

We spent years building a broad coalition made up of people with lived experience of homelessness, union members, faith leaders, social service providers, community organizations, and grassroots volunteers. From landlords sending intimidating emails to tenants to a legal challenge attempting to invalidate the results, the realtors, corporate landlords, and mega-developers fought us at every turn, but we always had the will and power of the people on our side.

These election results did not end the fight. Instead, they amplify our commitment to finding solutions for housing insecurity and addressing homelessness.

And so, while we are disappointed in the results, we continue to stay focused on what matters most: the building of a long-term movement for housing justice, with, for, and by the 68,000 Chicagoans experiencing homelessness in one of the richest cities in the world. We invite all who share this vision to join us for the next chapter. The fight for housing justice continues because housing is a human right.""

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra accused the Congress on Saturday of not complying with income tax rules, leading to the freezing of their bank accounts. Reacting to the Congress' allegation over the 'freezing' of its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, BJP leader Sambit Patra said, ""All political parties get an exemption in tax. Any party cannot be discriminated against in this. But why were Congress' accounts 'frozen'? The Congress party skipped the tax return deadline and extended deadline in 2017-18.""

He further stated that the Congress not only missed the extended deadline for filing tax returns but also exceeded the limit for cash donations. ""In 2017-18, the Congress broke two rules. It missed the extended deadline and exceeded the limit of cash donations. Under Rule 13A, it is clearly mentioned that if these rules are not complied with, the provision for exemptions will be withdrawn. So, in the nomenclature of income tax, the Congress party is defined as an 'association of persons,' and it would be subjected to normal tax liability,"" Patra said at a press conference on Saturday.

The BJP leader noted that all parties receive some exemption in taxes under the provisions of the Constitution. ""All political parties, under the rules of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, are granted an exemption in tax. This is a constitutional provision in India. No parties are discriminated against. The Congress, BJP, and TMC are treated the same,"" he explained.

Explaining why the Congress' accounts were frozen, Patra pointed out that the Congress had missed the extended deadline for paying their tax returns for 2017-18 by December 2018 and paid their taxes only in February 2019. ""Why were Congress' accounts frozen? The assessment for FY 2017-18 was evaluated in 2018-19. The tax had to be collected on the Congress party's business, donations of 2017-18, which had to be paid within the tax return deadline. There is also an extended deadline, and if we do not pay taxes within that date, we have to pay a penalty,"" the senior BJP leader explained.

""The Congress party had an extended deadline of December 31, 2018, to pay their tax return. But the Congress party did not comply with this. They paid their tax return in February 2019,"" Patra further clarified. Patra also highlighted that the Congress party exceeded the stipulated limit of cash donations and received donations worth Rs 14 lakhs in cash.

""Secondly, any political party cannot accept cash donations of more than Rs 20,000. But when the Congress party's accounts for 2017-18 were assessed in 2018-19, it was found that they had not complied with this rule. Astonishingly, despite knowing the rules, the Congress had accepted a cash donation of Rs 14 lakhs,"" Patra said. The Congress alleged on Thursday that the BJP froze its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, making it difficult for them to prepare for the elections.

Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi alleged on Thursday that there is a ""systematic effort"" underway by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""cripple"" the Indian National Congress financially, calling it ""unprecedented and undemocratic."" (ANI)

He addressed the full-day National Tax Conference, organised by the All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (AIFTP), South Zone, with support from the Telangana Tax Practitioners Association and the Federation of Telangana Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FTCCI), at FTCCI in Red Hills on Saturday.

Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, Judge, Supreme Court of India, was the Chief Guest, and Justice Alok Aradhe, Chief Justice, High Court of Telangana, was the Guest of Honour. They opened the Conference by lighting the lamp along with the office bearers of the AIFTP.

Giving his keynote address, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan shared his personal experiences as a Judge of the Mumbai High Court and the landmark judgments on arrest provisions of GST under section 69 and property attachment provisions under section 83 of GST Law. He narrated to the hall full of over 400 advocates, tax practitioners, and tax consultants his experiences as a Judge in Mumbai High Court on the arrest. He stated while no court in the country was giving bail to the arrested, they have granted bail based on the principle that the officers who have the power to arrest a person shall also record the reason before arresting the person. His judgment in the Mumbai High Court paved the way for similar judgments in granting bail on property attachment. He stated that it will infringe the right to privacy of the person and it shall be exercised by the officer concerned very judiciously. He recalled the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) compared with sections 69 and 83 of the GST law and stated that these stringent provisions of law given to officers will have a profound impact on the business. He also stated that the power shall be exercised in such a way that the business is not crippled.

Ujjal Bhuyan said it is always a pleasure to come back to Hyderabad, which is like a homecoming. I have sweet memories of this place. The people of Telangana are kind, he said.

Justice Alok Aradhe, Chief Justice of Telangana High Court, said tax is the critical pillar of a civil society. The government imposes taxes to run the machinery of the state. It fulfils the social and economic growth of society. Tax is a vast subject. It is a complex and rapidly changing one. Quoting Chanakya, an ancient Indian polymath, philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor, he said taxes from the citizens must be collected in such a way as honeybees collect nectar from the flowers, gently and without inflicting pain. He wished the conference would effectively exchange ideas and harness collective wisdom for the advancement of public good through reasonable and respectable practice.

The conference was organized in Hyderabad after an 8-year gap. It discussed Understanding Sec.43B(h): Section 147 and 148 from 1.4.2021: A Welcome Bliss or disguised Bane; Analysis of Input Tax Credit, U/s 16 (2) and 16 (4) & Recent Landmark decisions under GST.

Giving his welcome address Nagesh Rangi, Chairman of the Conference Committee, said the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who can't learn, unlearn and relearn. The national conference came to the city after a gap of many years. The purpose of this conference is to disseminate knowledge both on direct and indirect taxes. The year 2026 will be the golden jubilee year of AIFTP.

Meela Jayadev, President of FTCCI, said the conference is about keeping members abreast of the developments in the laws, which keep changing. The FTCCI has been demanding that the Telangana State Government increase the threshold limit for GST to Rs 40 lakh turnover as in many states from the current Rs 20 lakh, Meela Jayadev, President, FTCCI, reminded the audience and the learned experts in the audience.

K Narsing Rao, President of the Telangana Tax Practitioners Association, said 400 delegates from across India were participating in the conference.

Dr. Ramaraju Srinivas, Chairman of AIFTP South Zone, hoped that delegates would have an in-depth understanding of the laws and issues surrounding direct and indirect taxes at the end of the conference. Tax implementation is complex. It needs to be simplified. The conference theme is ""Legal & Ethical Dimensions in Taxation.""

Irshad Ahmed, Chairman of the GST and Customs Committee of FTCCI, said we have our share of memories of GST, which is now seven years in the journey. The GST practitioners have been looking forward to the setting up of The GST Appellate Tribunal, which is long overdue and represents a specialized authority formed to resolve GST-related disputes at the appellate level.

Sameer S. Jani, National Deputy President of AIFTP, spoke of 3es -- education, ethics, and excellence -- as a way forward for the profession. As tax practitioners, we supplement the government's efforts.The last conference held in Hyderabad was in 2015.

The amount of federal excise duty on petroleum products in the fiscal year 2023 was 0.7 per cent of the GDP, while for other items, it was 0.4 per cent of the GDP, mainly obtained from the federal excise duty on cigarettes.

The Petroleum Development Levy has undergone several changes in recent years, but there was a significant increase in it in fiscal year 2023.

It has been proposed to gradually increase excise duty on luxury items produced in the country, such as yachts, while enhancing border control. This is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of petroleum byproducts from sensitive areas in particular.

According to reports, an increase in federal excise duty (FED) at a uniform rate on domestically manufactured cigarettes has been recommended by the IMF. There is also a proposal to apply the same tax rate to imported cigarettes as local cigarettes.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that the financially beleaguered nation needed another long-term bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise its fragile economy, ARY News reported.

""A new tranche of loan is likely to be received from the IMF in a few days, however, we would need another programme,"" he said while addressing the session of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) apex committee attended by civil-military leadership.

The comments came a day after the IMF agreed to a staff-level agreement with Islamabad which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion under an existing USD 3 billion standby arrangement.

He said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the review for issuance of the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion which hopefully be received by next month.

""We will succeed gradually in breaking the begging bowl and coming out of the debt trap with the reforms,"" PM Sharif said.

He also sought the support of all political parties and the provincial governments to successfully implement the agenda of macroeconomic stability in the country, ARY News reported.

Banerjee

It has been stated at the time of issue of these securities by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative (IINSS-C) will not be listed. As per the scheme, it was stated that interest on IINSS-C will be accrued and compounded in the principal on half-yearly basis and paid along with principal at the redemption.

The RBI offers investors a return of 1.5 per cent more than inflation based on the consumer price index. Inflation indexed securities protect both the investors and issuers from the uncertainty of inflation over the life of the security. The other information on these securities, and terms, etc., can be obtained from the RBI and/or you may look at the details that would have been shared with you at the time of issue of these securities.

In response to your query, and as stated above, interest is accrued and compounded every six months. In view thereof, investors have to pay tax on it in the financial year when the interest accrues despite not getting actual payment of the interest. The interest will be taxable under the head ""income from other sources"".

Lai Mohammed, the former Minister of Information and Culture, has emphasized the necessity of regulating social media to counteract anti-state entities and anarchists within the nation.

During the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, held as part of Prof. Wole Soyinka's 90th birthday celebrations in Lagos, Mohammed stressed the importance of tighter controls on social media platforms. He highlighted the risk of exploitation by individuals seeking to undermine governmental authority and provoke unrest.

Mohammed clarified that his proposal isn't intended to suppress freedom of expression or silence dissent. Rather, it aims to ensure accountability and responsible conduct on these platforms.

Addressing the unchecked dissemination of misinformation and hate speech, Mohammed urged the government to hold social media companies accountable for allowing misleading content to circulate freely.

He said: ""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can easily broadcast whatever they want.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other content, making it appear that individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination worldwide. While these platforms have democratized access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for spreading falsehoods and manipulation. The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety. False narratives surrounding elections can trigger legitimacy problems for the winner.

""Conspiracy theories fuel vaccine hesitancy, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, among other consequences of fake news. The impact of misinformation can be devastating, exacerbating existing fault lines and hindering collective action.""

He, however, cleared the air on why ex-President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration suspended the services of Twitter (now X), stating that the move was to check the nefarious activities of some groups bent on promoting anarchy.

The Michigan State Spartans and the N. Carolina Tar Heels will face of in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at 5:30 p.m. ET on Saturday at Spectrum Center. The stakes are high as the pair are all in, both fighting to extend their postseason success.

Winning is just a little bit easier when your three-point shooting is a whole 21.3% better than the opposition, a fact Michigan State proved on Thursday. They strolled past Miss. State with points to spare, taking the game 69-51.

Michigan State can attribute much of their success to Tyson Walker, who scored 19 points along with three steals. Walker didn't help Michigan State's cause all that much against Purdue last Friday but the same can't be said for this contest. The team also got some help courtesy of Jaden Akins, who scored 15 points along with seven rebounds.

Meanwhile, N. Carolina must've know the odds they were up against on Thursday, but they decided it wasn't going to be the story of the game. They blew past Wagner, posting a 90-62 win on the road. N. Carolina's victory was all the more impressive since the Seahawks were averaging only 63.12 points allowed on the season.

N. Carolina got their win on the backs of several key players, but it was Armando Bacot out in front who dropped a double-double on 20 points and 15 rebounds. Bacot is on a roll when it comes to rebounds, as he's now pulled down ten or more in the last four games he's played. RJ Davis was another key contributor, scoring 22 points.

NEW YORK (AP) -- It's tax season in the U.S., and for many people, filing tax returns can be a daunting task that's often left until the last minute. But if you want to avoid the stress of the looming deadline, start getting organized as soon as possible.

Whether you do your taxes yourself, go to a tax clinic or hire a professional, navigating the tax system can be complicated and stressful. Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate for Credit Karma, recommends you go easy on yourself.

This decision comes as part of the bankruptcy proceedings of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Anthropic's executives have pointed to national security concerns as the underlying reason for excluding Saudi Arabian investors, a decision that has been making headlines since CNBC first reported it.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial figure behind FTX, originally acquired the stake three years ago for a whopping $500 million. In the intervening period, the burgeoning interest in artificial intelligence technologies has propelled the value of this stake to exceed $1 billion. The proceeds from this sale are earmarked to reimburse FTX customers, with insiders hinting at a conclusion to the transaction within weeks. These class B shares, lacking in voting rights, are being sold based on Anthropic's recent valuation pegged at $18.4 billion.

Having raised around $7 billion from tech magnates like Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce, Anthropic is a direct competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT with its advanced language model. Despite the fundraising endeavors, founders Dario and Daniela Amodei, although retaining the right to screen potential investors, have stepped back from the current sale discussions and the fundraising process involving FTX's stake.

While Saudi investments have been sidelined, Anthropic remains open to other sovereign wealth funds, including the United Arab Emirates' Mubadala, which is reportedly contemplating an investment in Anthropic. This openness to diverse funding sources highlights the complex landscape of international tech investments, where sovereign wealth funds play a significant role.

Saudi Arabia, with its sovereign wealth fund (PIF) holding assets over $900 billion, has been aggressively investing in technology to diversify its economy. The fund's tech pursuits align with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 Initiative, aiming to modernize the Saudi economy. However, Anthropic's reservations reflect broader concerns over dual-use technologies and the potential for misuse in military applications, spotlighting the intricate balance between technological advancement and national security.

The exclusion of Saudi Arabian investors from Anthropic's stake sale underscores the geopolitical sensitivities surrounding technology investments and national security. As the AI industry continues to evolve, the interplay between global investment strategies and security considerations will undoubtedly remain a topic of intense scrutiny.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1843137254901961,448895538,1,https://btc-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/png-24.png,eng-9418924

Since the beginning of the year, lawmakers in Arizona, Nebraska and Illinois have introduced versions of the Pacific Conflict Stress Test Act -- bills that impose checklists of potential local vulnerabilities in supply chains and infrastructure security if Beijing eventually uses force to ""reunify"" with Taiwan.

It's an attempt to address fears that China could pair aggression against Taiwan with acts against the U.S., for example by hacking water systems or the electrical grid.

One of the latest bills was introduced Wednesday in the Arizona House of Representatives. It would obligate Arizona's government to draft strategies to reduce risks to the state if conflict breaks out in the Pacific. ""It also would require Arizona to examine potential cyberattack vulnerabilities in its critical infrastructure as well as the implications for ""disruption or complete severing of supply chains between this state, its vendors and other countries in the Pacific.""

""We're a state that's uniquely vulnerable to attacks on our critical infrastructure,"" said Arizona Rep. Alexander Kolodin -- one of six Republican state lawmakers who voted to introduce the bill in the House. ""The black swan event of a Chinese attack that takes down the grid for a prolonged period of time can't really be discounted.""

The Nebraska and Illinois bills mirror the language in the Arizona version. The Nebraska bill will ""be advanced out of committee and to the floor sometime early next week,"" the office of Democratic Sen. Eliot Bostar said in a statement on Friday. The Illinois bill passed first reading and is now under consideration by the Senate Assignments Committee. The sponsor of the Illinois bill didn't respond to a request for comment.

Those bills are the brainchild of Michael Lucci, founder of the hawkish nonprofit advocacy group State Armor which is lobbying states to enact laws aimed to insulate them from potentially malign Chinese influence. The organization does not receive corporate funding, Lucci said, and is a bipartisan nonprofit focused on ""protecting America and its citizens from Communist China.""

The inspiration for the legislative push was the pandemic-related supply chain disruptions for China-produced items including personal protective equipment and other medical supplies.

""It's a concept that we originated and ... lawmakers say 'Hey, can you put pen to paper and kind of sketch out what you think that looks like?'"" Lucci said. State Armor launched operations in January and its drive to convince state lawmakers to take up anti-Chinese Communist Party legislation is its first lobbying campaign. Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), chair of the House Select Committee on China has praised the group for ""acting with a sense of urgency"" while former national security adviser Robert O'Brien has commended its ""ready-for-action"" lobbying plans.

Still, the legislation isn't always getting traction. The Arizona House bill is a revival of legislation that died on the Arizona Senate floor earlier this month.

Arizona Sen. Frank Carroll -- who is listed as a sponsor on both the Senate and House versions of the bill -- said his fight isn't over and noted that if the legislation passes in the House it will come back for consideration in the Senate.

Even the most pessimistic analysts say a cross-Strait conflict with China isn't imminent. Still, warnings from the Chinese government and from U.S. military officials suggest it's a real possibility.

Predictions of the economic impact of confrontation across the Strait are dire. A blockade of the self-governing island could cost the global economy ""well over two trillion dollars,"" the Rhodium Group economic research firm said in December.

And state-level infrastructure could be a target. FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional hearing in January that ""China's hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities.""

The state initiatives echo moves by legislators in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia to brace their economies for the impact of a possible war over Taiwan. The International Parliamentary Alliance on China, a non-partisan grouping of lawmakers -- including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- focused on countering China's threats to democratic countries, launched Operation MIST, an initiative to ""measure impact of a shock in the Taiwan Strait"" earlier this month.

Politicians realize ""they've got huge skin in the game when it comes to Taiwan,"" said Luke de Pulford, IPAC's executive director. Lawmakers taking action now to address those risks can avoid voters ""waking up to an economic crisis five times worse than that caused by Ukraine that governments haven't done anything to prevent,"" de Pulford said.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.4823529411764705,448895498,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

The big-time matchup seemed to have everyone's attention as soon as it was clear that both teams would take care of matters in the opening round.

""The second round has always been real,"" North Carolina coach Hubert Davis said. ""When it gets down to the round of 32, there's only 32 teams left. So that round is normally going to be two extremely good programs. We're excited about the challenge of playing against a great Michigan State team.""

Top-seeded North Carolina (28-7) will play about a 2 1/2-hour drive away from its campus in Chapel Hill. Ninth-seeded Michigan State (20-14) has taken a winding road this season, but the Spartans might be tuning up at just the right time.

""I kept saying all year this team was good enough, and I was proving me wrong just because of the mistakes we made,"" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ""Why we don't lock in all the time, again, that falls on me.""

North Carolina recorded a 90-62 win over No. 16 seed Wagner on Thursday, but the Tar Heels know they'll need more precision to ace this next test.

""We've got to do a better job going into Saturday because Michigan State is a really good ballclub,"" North Carolina guard RJ Davis said. ""We've got to come ready to play.""

Michigan State fans turned out in nice numbers for the first-round game against No. 8 seed Mississippi State, but their roar might not be heard as easily in this next game.

""The atmosphere was really good,"" Michigan State guard Jaden Akins said. ""Our fans showed out, as they always do. I heard a lot of 'Go green! Go white!' chants throughout the arena. It's March, so it's always going to be a great atmosphere.""

The Tar Heels are 35-2 in NCAA Tournament games in the state of North Carolina. That mark is 13-1 in Charlotte, though there was a 2018 second-round setback to Texas A&M.

Izzo holds an NCAA Tournament-record 17 victories in games as a lower seed, including in Thursday's matchup, when the Spartans handled Mississippi State 69-51.

Michigan State limited Mississippi State to a season-low point total, but the Tar Heels have more potent weapons. RJ Davis and Armando Bacot have 20 or more points in the same game five times this season.

For much of the season, Michigan State followed North Carolina's path from last season. Yet the Spartans, the preseason No. 4 team, had enough breakthroughs to reach the NCAA Tournament.

North Carolina began the 2022-23 season with the No. 1 national ranking, but it faltered so much that it didn't even land a bid for the NCAA Tournament.

So this could turn out to be a version of a redemption tour for the Tar Heels.

""It's win or go home. If you lose, you go home,"" said Bacot, a fifth-year player. ""It's just one of those things that's an even more sense of urgency to just go out there and play my best. All years we've worked to get to this point.""

The Tar Heels are 5-0 all-time against Michigan State in NCAA Tournament play, most recently meeting in the 2009 national championship game in Detroit.

(See Figure 1.) The 2017 law also widens racial disparities in after-tax income.[11]

The 2017 tax law's tilt to the top reflects several costly provisions that primarily benefit the most well-off:

The law's expiring provisions included some provisions affecting families with low and moderate incomes, but often in offsetting ways. For example, the law lowered statutory tax rates at all income levels, nearly doubled the size of the standard deduction from $13,000 to $24,000 for a married couple in 2018, and doubled the size of the Child Tax Credit for many families.[14] Yet other provisions raised taxes on families, such as the elimination of personal exemptions and the new, permanent inflation adjustment for key tax parameters.[15] The end result of these offsetting changes is only modest tax cuts for most families, which pale in comparison to the law's large net tax cuts for the wealthy.

Failing to allow the individual income tax and estate tax provisions to end as scheduled would benefit high-income households far more than other income groups. Extending them would boost after-tax incomes for the top 1 percent -- those with incomes over $1 million -- more than twice as much as for the bottom 60 percent as a percentage of their incomes in 2026.[16] In dollar terms, extending the expiring provisions only (that is, excluding the effect of the large corporate tax cuts the law made permanent) would result in a $48,000 tax cut for households in the top 1 percent in 2026, but only about $500 for those in the bottom 60 percent of households, on average.[17]

As the 2017 law's individual income and estate tax cuts approach expiration, policymakers and the public should keep two important dynamics in mind.

First, in addition to the top 1 percent receiving very large tax cuts, the 2017 law delivered the largest average tax cut -- measured as a percentage of pre-tax income -- to households in the 95-99th percentiles. Their tax cut from the 2017 law amounts to 3.2 percent of their pre-tax income, on average (or nearly $13,000, on average).[18] This is more than triple the roughly 1 percent average percentage income gain of the bottom 60 percent.[19] (See Figure 2.)",commondreams.org,news,Common Dreams,,0.1764705882352942,448895429,1,https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/donald-trump-and-republican-lawmakers-celebrate-passage-of-their-tax-cut-bill.jpg?id=32135855&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C250%2C0%2C250,eng-9411982

Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing.

The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament last week.

It includes measures that will apply to large landholdings of over 1000 hectares, prohibiting sales in certain cases until ministers can consider the impact on the local community.

The Scottish Government says this could lead to some landholdings being lotted into smaller parts if that may help local communities.

It will also provide communities with more opportunities to own land through introducing advance notice of certain sales from large landholdings.

The Bill will also places legal responsibilities on the owners of the largest landholdings to show how they use their land and how that use contributes to key public policy priorities, such as addressing climate change and protecting and restoring nature and includes a duty on Scottish Ministers to publish a model Land Management Tenancy which will support people to use and manage land in a way that meets their, and the nation's, needs.

It also includes a number of measures to reform tenant farming and small landholding legislation, providing more opportunities to improve land, to become more sustainable and productive and to ensure that tenants are fairly rewarded for their investment of time and resources in compensation at end of tenancy.

Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: ""We do not think it is right that ownership and control of much of Scotland's land is still in the hands of relatively few people. We want Scotland to have a strong and dynamic relationship between its land and people.

""We want to be a nation where rights and responsibilities in relation to land and its natural capital are fully recognised and fulfilled. That was our aim in 2016, and it remains our aim today.

""So, this Bill sets out ambitious proposals to allow the benefits and opportunities of Scotland's land to be more widely shared.

""Too often, people and communities feel powerless when the land they live on is sold with no prior warning - this Bill will help to change that. We will introduce measures so that more communities are be given information and the opportunity to take on ownership before sales from landholdings over 1,000 hectares.

""Crucially, when one of these landholdings is being sold, we want government to have the power to step in and require that it be sold in smaller parcels to different people if that will help to make local populations and communities more sustainable.""

The Scottish Land Commission, which provided research and analysis for the Land Reform Bill, introduced today by the Scottish Government, has welcomed it as ""landmark legislation.""

Chairman Michael Russell said: ""We are pleased to welcome the publication of the Scottish Government's new Land Reform Bill, which draws on our research and analysis.

""This landmark legislation is a meaningful and important step forward in addressing the over-concentration of land ownership, which continues to be a central issue in Scotland's ongoing journey of land reform.

""Our research has consistently shown the pitfalls associated with such a concentration of land ownership, including the impacts that localised monopolies can have on local economic opportunities and communities.""",northern-times.co.uk,news,Northern Times,,0.4431372549019608,448895425,1,https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/4D36HFHWXMY7CUCG8FDH.jpg,

Although they pulled back to $95 a pound the market is still ripe for additional gains.

A combination of factors contribute to the rise. Energy demand is increasing globally and nations are exploring all possible sources to meet it. Especially after the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was sabotaged, nuclear energy is back on the table. Although Germany shut down its last remaining reactors last year, Japan, France and Norway all approved new measures for going nuclear. Over 20 countries have called for tripling nuclear capacity by 2050.

Yet the primary cause behind the recent spike was the world's largest uranium producer Kazatomprom (OTCMKTS:NATKY) announcing it would not meet production goals for 2024 and 2025.

Kazakhstan produces over 40% of all the world's uranium supply, according to the World Nuclear Association. Canada is second at 15% and Namibia comes in third with 11% of the total. However, no country produces more nuclear energy than the U.S. It accounts for 30% of global output.

Uranium miners are springing into action. Dormant mines in states such as Wyoming, Texas, Arizona and Utah were all recently restarted. With future growth assured, these are the three miners you will want to ride to new heights.

Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) is one of the world's largest uranium miners. It owns mines in Saskatchewan and the U.S., as well as having a 40% stake in a joint venture with Kazatomprom for a mine in Kazakhstan.

The miner has been at this for 35 years and its long-term supply contracts give it clear insight into where, when and how it needs to deliver uranium to customers. The newest contracts allow Cameco to guide for production of 18 million pounds at each of its McArthur River/Key Lake and Cigar Lake projects this year. The miner also acquired last November a 49% interest in Westinghouse Electric, one of the world's largest nuclear services businesses. Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) took the other 51%. Cameco expects to receive adjusted EBITDA of $445 million and $510 million this year from the venture, which will grow at a compounded growth rate of 6% to 10% a year.

Although CCJ stock fell after its fourth-quarter earnings report, shares are still up 68% over the past year. But trading at 25 times expected earnings and less than twice the long-term earnings growth rate, Cameco is a uranium stock to add that special glow to your portfolio.

Canadian uranium miner NexGen Energy (NYSE:NXE) focuses on the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan. It wholly owns the Rook I project, the largest development-stage uranium project in Canada. The project is centered around the Arrow development, a world-class resource where NexGen just announced the discovery of new intense uranium mineralization. The miner will be dedicating drilling operations to the area as it reflects high potential for new resources.

While the project has substantial potential considering the resources contained in the region, investors also need to be mindful that NexGen does not generate any revenue at the moment. The company only receives money from the interest earned on its cash. At the end of December, its cash balance stood at $290.7 million more than double the amount it had the year before due to financings it took during the year. Current shareholders can expect to be diluted from these events but with the hope of realizing significant profits when the Rook I eventually comes online.

Despite this, NXE stock has doubled over the past year as investors foresee the potential of the Rook I project.

A better way to gain exposure to uranium miners is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE:URA). The reason is that many miners are like NexGen Energy: development-stage outfits without actual mining operations. For example, Uranium Energy (NYSE:UEC) has interests in several mines but actually derives revenue by buying uranium on the spot market and then reselling it at higher prices.

Global X Uranium ETF is the largest uranium ETF with $2.8 billion in assets under management (UAM). It owns shares in 47 different companies but most of its assets are in Cameco, which represents 21.2% of the total. The next largest holding is Sprotts Physical Uranium Trust (OTCMKTS:SRUUF), an ETF listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that represents 9% of total assets. As its name suggests, Sprotts holds physical uranium, some 63.6 million pounds of uranium 3o8 that has a market value of more than $5.5 billion.

Other miners in Global X's portfolio include NexGen, Uranium Energy, Dennison Mines (NYSE:DNN) and others. Most of the miners are Canadian but Australian miners make up a large component too, with just a handful coming from the U.S.

There is a certain level of concentration because there are relatively few uranium miners. An ETF gives investors the best shot at exposure to the sector but as much diversification as possible. Shares of the ETF are up 48% from last year.",investorplace.com,news,InvestorPlace,Rich Duprey,0.09019607843137245,448895204,1,https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/uranium-1600-1.png,

The perpetrator, a troubled former student, had exhibited alarming behavioral red flags prior to the attack, highlighting the urgent need for preventive measures.

These laws provide a crucial mechanism for intervention in cases where individuals exhibit signs of imminent danger, such as severe mental health crises or threats of violence.

During her visit to Parkland, Vice President Harris urged states across the nation to adopt and strengthen red flag legislation. Currently, only six states have implemented such laws, while the remaining states grapple with varying degrees of firearm regulation. By leveraging federal funding provided under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, Harris aims to incentivize states to prioritize the implementation of crisis intervention programs and red flag laws.

Despite their potential to save lives, red flag laws have faced resistance from some quarters, with critics citing concerns about constitutional rights and due process. Advocates argue, however, that the fundamental right to bear arms must be balanced with public safety considerations, particularly in the face of escalating gun violence.

Passing 40-12, House Bill 1015 will accelerate an already-planned income tax cut for individuals.

Passing 34-17, House Bill 1023 will decrease the corporate income tax rate to match the rate for individuals.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp is expected to sign the two measures into law.

Cornelia Republican Sen. Bo Hatchett, a floor leader for Kemp, said, ""We are continuing to conservatively manage our budget and put money back in the hands of Georgians.""

Some Democratic senators voted against each bill.

However, the only lawmaker who spoke against the cuts was Trenton Republican Sen. Colton Moore, who challenged fellow lawmakers to cut personal income tax rates by even more.

""It will be a fraud when you go back home and say, 'I am only cutting the income tax by a tenth of a point,'"" said Moore, who still voted for the measure.

The measure will roll back the personal income tax rate to 5.39 percent, retroactive to January 1.

Currently, Georgia has a flat income tax rate of 5.49 percent, passed under a 2022 law. However, under the new measure, the rate will drop 0.1 percent annually until reaching 4.99 percent if state revenues are maintained.

The corporate income tax had stayed at 5.75 percent, but under the new bill, it will keep falling along with the personal income tax rate until reaching the same minimum rate of 4.99 percent.

Despite the growth in state tax collections slowing, Georgia can afford tax cuts as it budgeted to spend less than the income collected in taxes.

In an effort to reverse an alarming trend of fentanyl overdose deaths among infants and toddlers, state Sen. Dave Cortese has introduced legislation intended to provide counties with better tools to protect the Golden State's youngest opioid victims.

The San Jose Democrat said his legislation was inspired by ongoing reporting by the Bay Area News Group about the deaths of three Bay Area infants and toddlers, including 3-month-old baby Phoenix Castro, of San Jose, who was sent home with her drug-using father last year despite warnings from social workers.

Cortese called on the state's Department of Public Health to release guidance, data and informational materials to counties about how to deal with fentanyl exposure among California's youngest residents.

Although he provided no specific proposals, preferring to leave it to health experts, Cortese suggested delaying the reunification of children younger than 5 and with parents who have substance abuse issues.

""Public health is as close as we're gonna get to a statewide agency that can actually step in and say, we're going to take the best practices, the best criteria, the best guidelines ... (and) export those across all 58 counties,"" Cortese said.

Cortese's bill, Senate Bill 908, is one of several being introduced this legislative session targeting the lethal drug that killed just over 340 children younger than 5 nationally from 1999 to 2021, including 105 who were younger than 1. The overdose death of baby Phoenix last May, and the Bay Area News Group's investigation that followed, led to calls for an overhaul of Santa Clara County's Department of Children and Family Services and the prosecution of her father, David Castro, on felony child endangerment charges.

Baby Kristofer Ferreyra, 1, of Fremont, died last October after ingesting a lethal dose of fentanyl while at home with his mother. Baby Winter Rayo died on Aug. 12, after ingesting a lethal dose of fentanyl. Her parents have been charged with murder.

Steve Baron, a member of the Santa Clara County Child Abuse Prevention Council, welcomed more state involvement on preventing young child fentanyl deaths. The state health department could flag important issues, he said, including instructions on using the overdose-reversing medication ""Narcan on young children, including toddlers like Phoenix Castro."" Although Baron said he also hoped that state and local agencies in charge of child welfare were also included in the bill.

Some experts, however, are already flagging concerns around Cortese's bill proposal, saying it has several key shortcomings and may not actually address the issues leading up to the fentanyl deaths of baby Phoenix and others whose tragedies have made headlines in recent months.

Dr. Jeoffry Gordon, a family physician and member of the California Critical Incidents child abuse citizen review panel, said that the state already does a decent job providing policy guidance to counties on how to handle tricky child abuse cases.

The issues in Santa Clara County leading up to baby Phoenix's death, he says, were ""dysfunctional"" county policies and practices, not faulty state guidance.

""To me, the idea that something like this gets a law is putting a small band aid on a festering wound,"" he said.

Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCLA, Chelsea Shover, raised caution about any proposals that automatically delay the reunification of children younger than 5 with parents suffering from substance abuse.

""What I worry about when we talk about adding state level policy is the unintended consequences of making it harder for people to seek care for fear of consequences, like having their kids removed,"" Shover said. ""It's what we see in states where substance use during pregnancy is criminalized -- people are less likely to seek care.""

Experts say they are generally in favor of releasing more data on child fentanyl fatalities but said there are limitations to what can ethically be disclosed. The main problem is that there are few recorded fentanyl deaths in the 0-5 age group, perhaps a dozen or fewer statewide each year. Publishing statistics documenting a small number of deaths could present privacy concerns.

Other bills have also been introduced this session that specifically take aim at the growing threat of fentanyl. State Sens. Tom Umberg, an Orange County Democrat, and Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, a San Bernardino Republican, have re-introduced a bill, known as Alexandra's Law, which would give convicted opioid dealers a written notice that they could be charged with homicide if one of their customers dies. That bill stalled last session.

A separate bill proposal by Assemblymember Matt Haney would create a state pilot program to test wastewater throughout California for traces of ""cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine, xylazine, methadone, buprenorphine, and naloxone.""

She reminded people that citrus peels are edible and don't have to be tossed in the garbage, stuck the label ""scrappy cooking"" on her video and walked away.

The response was electrifying.

""I came back an hour later, and that video had been viewed by millions of people,"" said the Barrie, Ont., cookbook author and food blogger.

""Everybody had struck up this conversation about food waste that previously wasn't being had. I just thought, 'Wow.""'

That ""scrappy"" culinary moment appeared to strike a chord with millions of people who were stressed out by rising food prices and ever-tighter family budgets.

It became the inspiration for Bodrug's soon-to-be-released second cookbook, and inspired her popular social media series where she shares tips such as how to make pesto using the tops of carrots and beets or how to turn potato peels into a delicious crispy snack.

According to a 2021 UN report, the average Canadian household produces 79 kilograms of food waste per year. This refers to food that is thrown out because of issues like improper storage, overbuying, inefficiently used ingredients going bad, and poor planning.

Wasted food has an environmental impact, in that disposed-of organic material in landfills is a source of greenhouse gas emissions.

But it's also, as Bodrug puts it, ""literally like throwing money down the drain.""

In Canada, the National Zero Waste Council has estimated that more than a third of food produced and distributed domestically never gets eaten, and that $49 billion worth of food in this country is sent to landfill or composted each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that a family of four wastes about US$1,500 in food annually.

""I polled my audience a couple of weeks ago on what the average family spends on groceries in a week, and it was over $200 in groceries,"" said Bodrug, who now has 3.2 million followers on the social media website TikTok.

""""I mean, there's huge opportunities there for saving.""

Joshna Maharaj, a Toronto-based chef and activist, said she's fascinated by the ""scrappy cooking"" movement and the sudden popularity of making fresh pickles with leftover brine from a store-bought jar of dills, or freezing the green tops of strawberries for smoothies.

While the trend is obviously rooted in the current cost-of-living crisis, Maharaj said she believes there's also some nostalgia there for earlier time periods when nearly all cooking was done at home and nothing went to waste. Some Canadians may recall the budget-friendly recipes or household economy habits of their grandparents, who may have learned how to conserve during the Great Depression or Second World War.

""People have a longing for being in the kitchen, but we've become so disconnected from it over time that we have a fear and anxiety about it,"" Maharaj said.

""But regardless of what time period we're living in, I can confidently say that cooking your food for yourself at home is the most nutritious and economical way for you to eat. There's no question.""

It's possible to work toward a full-fledged zero-waste kitchen, doing things like using spent coffee grounds to flavour cookies and brownies or regrowing green onions by planting the leftover white tips.

But Maharaj said for most people, developing simple habits like weekly meal planning and regular fridge and pantry clean-outs can significantly reduce the amount of food they throw away.

""Omelettes and frittatas are a wonderful way to use up scraps. Make friends with dishes like soups,"" Maharaj said.

What's required here is just more habits and intention and time spent.""

Canning, fermenting, dehydrating and freezing are also great ways to reduce food waste, especially if you have a garden or are buying in bulk from the farmer's market, said Heather O'Shea, the Whitby, Ont., woman behind the blog ""From Hustle to Homestead.""

O'Shea also suggests home cooks keep a bag in their freezer where they toss bits of onion, tops of carrots, celery leaves and other produce scraps throughout the week. When the bag is full, simmer the works in a big pot with some salt and pepper for flavourful home-made vegetable broth.

""Never, never buy soup stock at the store if you can make it from what you would have thrown away,"" she said.

The key, O'Shea said, is to start small and not to get overwhelmed.

""Start with what you can start with. Don't try to do everything at once,"" she said.

""There's a lot you can do to both save money and reduce food waste, so start with one thing, and then add another thing in time.""",ctvnews.ca,news,CTV News,,-0.0980392156862745,448893286,1,https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/22/carleigh-bodrug-1-6818100-1711117068503.jpg,

The Ex-minister emphasised the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence

He noted that his position is not to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step towards ensuring that social media platforms are held accountable.

Mohammed, who is also the Managing Partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, made the call at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos on Friday.

The theme of the event is ""Disinformation and Misinformation: The Media in the Age of Discontent."".

""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of social media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society,"" Mohammed said.

He further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to the former minister, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He, however, warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

Mohammed noted that social media remains a major space for the proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching in the sense of undermining democratic processes, among others.

""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings, or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is the era of deep fakes!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over.

""While these platforms have democratised access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation.

""The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety. False narratives surrounding elections can trigger legitimacy problems for the winner.

""There were conspiracy theories fueling vaccine hesitancy, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, among other consequences of fake news. The impact of misinformation can be devastating, exacerbating existing fault lines and hindering collective action.""

While explaining why the Buhari-led administration suspended the services of Twitter, now X, Mohammed said the move was to checkmate the nefarious activities of some groups bent on promoting anarchy.

According to him, ""We were compelled to suspend the services of Twitter, now X when it became evident that Twitter had yielded its platform to proscribed groups who were bent on promoting anarchy and destabilising the country.""",tribuneonlineng.com,news,Tribune Online,Collins Nnabuife,0.0980392156862746,448892765,1,https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lai-Mohammed-new-e1711196086949.jpg,eng-9420039

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of social media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Speaking further, Mohammed noted that social media remained a major space for the proliferation of fake news, stressing that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation were far-reaching, including undermining democratic processes.

He further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a severe threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He added, ""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratized access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation. The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety.

Ukraine aims to secure the purchase of two nuclear reactors from Bulgaria to bolster its energy capacity, with hopes of finalizing the agreement as early as June.

The head of Ukraine's nuclear company, Energoatom, revealed to Reuters the pressing necessity for supplementary power generation in light of the shutdown of theZaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility housing six reactors.

The proposed deal entails installing the acquired reactors at Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant in the western region, equipped with Russian-designed components sourced from Bulgaria. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, underscored the significance of expediting negotiations, emphasizing the impending energy crisis and the vital role these reactors would play in mitigating it.

While negotiations between the Ukrainian and Bulgarian governments continue, Kotin expressed optimism regarding the likelihood of reaching a consensus by June. He outlined plans for the swift installation of the first reactor, setting a demanding timeline for its completion to address the pressing energy demands.

In addition to the procurement of reactors, Energoatom is also exploring collaborations with General Electric for the construction of essential turbine components, essential for reactor operation. The ambitious endeavor aims to bolster Ukraine's energy independence and resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges.

However, the negotiations have encountered hurdles, with Bulgaria initially seeking to revise the pricing terms for the reactors. Despite the price adjustments proposed by Bulgaria, Ukraine remains steadfast in its pursuit of an equitable agreement, prioritizing affordability amidst escalating energy demands.

The genesis of the proposed deal can be traced back to Bulgaria's earlier acquisition of the reactors for the planned Belene Nuclear Power Plant. In a strategic move, Bulgaria authorized the potential sale of these reactors to Ukraine, recognizing the imperative of bolstering regional energy security and cooperation.

Meanwhile, amidst the ongoing energy crisis exacerbated by the closure of theZaporizhzhia plant, Ukraine remains resolute in its determination to restore the facility to operational status. Despite logistical and infrastructural challenges, Energoatom retains preparedness to recommission the plant post-""de-occupation,"" underscoring Ukraine's commitment to energy sovereignty and resilience.

This question may be from me as to whether the taxpayer made the 2023 estimated tax payments, we had set them up with, or it may be from the taxpayer as to why we have set them up with estimated tax payments for 2024. In either case, there is often a great deal of confusion surrounding estimated payments and when and why they need to be made.

The majority of individual income tax payments to the government are from withholding from wages, retirement plans, and other income. However, some individuals have income where no withholding took place including interest, dividends, capital gains, and social security. Whether or not there has been withholding, there may be a tax obligation resulting from this income. Outside of withholding, the most common other form of individual tax payments to the taxing agencies is in the form of estimated tax payments.

If you do not have sufficient withholding or make adequate estimated tax payments throughout the year, most taxing agencies will charge you a penalty and interest. The IRS and other tax agencies do not care how they get the payments, whether it is through withholding or through estimated tax payments, but in many cases, the funds must be paid throughout the year. Estimated tax payments are the sole responsibility of the person receiving the untaxed money.

Some of my clients avoid making the estimated tax payments that we set up for them because they figure that they will just pay the balance due at the tax filing deadline. However, if the taxpayer fails to make adequate estimated tax payments or have sufficient withholding, then penalties and interest charges will result. I have a couple of clients that refuse to pay the estimated tax payments throughout the year, but are frustrated and upset when they incur penalties. You really cannot have it both ways and need to choose whether you want to wait and pay the interest and penalties, or avoid those and make the timely payments throughout the year.

Individuals, including sole proprietors, partners and S corporation shareholders generally need to make estimated tax payments if they expect to owe federal income tax of $1,000 or more when their return is filed. You may be able to increase your federal withholding from other income sources where withholding is available to avoid paying estimated taxes throughout the year.

Estimated tax payments are normally due four times throughout the year on April 15, June 15, Sept. 15 and Jan. 15 (for the prior year). If you do not pay enough tax by the due date of each of the payment periods you may be charged a penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your income tax return. It is extremely challenging to explain to a client that they are overpaid on their total taxes, yet have an underpayment penalty because they did not consistently make the estimated payments throughout the year.

To make the estimated tax payments, you can send a paper check along with IRS Form 1040-ES. You can also choose to pay electronically by enrolling in the IRS Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, or EFTPS, or you can choose to use the Direct Pay option available from the IRS.

Finally, it is important to keep a record of the estimated tax payments you actually do make throughout the year as you will need to report these at tax filing time. Some of my clients make all of the estimated payments we set them up with, some make none, and others choose to make some payments of different amounts to set up. A tax return cannot be accurately prepared without knowing the amounts and timing of any estimated tax payments, and a tax preparer cannot quickly and easily find this information on their own due to security concerns. It is difficult, if not impossible, for a preparer to get the information from the IRS as to what estimated tax payments were actually made.",news-herald.com,news,The News-Herald,Paul Pahoresky,0.1137254901960785,448892476,1,https://www.news-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/income-tax-form.jpg?w=640,eng-9411982

To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

This free interactive report on Waste Management's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Waste Management the TSR over the last 5 years was 122%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

We're pleased to report that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Waste Management has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

The Marble Freedom Trust, a nonprofit for which Leo acts as chairman, has found itself under the microscope of media outlets and Democratic politicians such as Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse due to Leo's involvement in the conservative judicial sphere.

During its 2022 fiscal year, the group gave large sums of money to three other entities.

""Liberals, led by over $1 billion a year from the foreign-funded Arabella Advisors network, have dominated dark money in politics,"" a Marble Freedom Trust spokesperson told Fox News Digital.""In the face of such lopsided spending, Marble Freedom Trust is working to even the playing field so that conservatives can crush liberal dominance.""

FEDERAL JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT CHALLENGING DC NONCITIZEN VOTING LAW

According to the Marble Freedom Trust's newest tax forms, Leo's group disbursed $216.8 million between May 2022 and May 2023, an increase of $34.1 million over the previous year, when it handed out $182 million in donations.

The new tax documents show the nonprofit pushed a bulk of this cash -- $153.7 million -- to the Schwab Charitable Fund, a donor-advised fund used by groups and individuals to make other charitable contributions.

The New York Times previously reported that the Schwab Charitable Fund gave $141.5 million to the 85 Fund, another group linked to Leo, before the period laid out in the most recent tax forms.

During its most recent fiscal year, the Marble Freedom Trust also provided $55.5 million to the Concord Fund, which previously was known as the Judicial Crisis Network and also has been tied to Leo.

Its last donation -- in the amount of $7.6 million -- went to the Knights of Columbus Charitable Fund, another donor-advised fund.

Once an organization or individual pushes money to entities such as the Schwab Charitable Fund and Knights of Columbus Charitable Fund, it is practically impossible to trace where the money ends up.

Leo has been the target of Democratic lawmakers over his involvement in right-leaning judicial matters as part of their investigation into Supreme Court justices.

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats Dick Durbin of Illinois and Whitehouse have sent letters to Leo and billionaire activists seeking information regarding trips and events Supreme Court justices have taken and participated in over the years.

In October, the senators sent a letter to Leo, Harlan Crow and Robin Arkley in an attempt to strong-arm them into complying with a previous July request for details about trips involving justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.

Leo, however, rejected their demands in a letter his attorneys sent to committee Chairman Durbin, a copy of which Fox News Digital previously obtained.

""We have put forward clear and detailed reasons why the Committee's inquiry is a form of political retaliation in violation of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause,"" Leo's attorney, David Rivkin, wrote in the letter.

""But, for the most part, the October 5 Letter ignores these points, and, since our last correspondence, the Committee has only expanded the retaliatory campaign it is mounting against Mr. Leo.""

For decades, Leo has been a part of the Federalist Society, which progressive activists have long criticized for its involvement in helping advise and lobby former President Trump through the nominations of Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

Leo has also been a target of Washington, D.C.'s Democratic Atorney General Brian Schwalb, who launched an investigation into Leo's network last summer.

The SEC has filed its opening remedies brief along with supporting documents, albeit under seal. These developments come as the latest in a series of legal moves that have captivated the attention of the cryptocurrency industry. The sealed documents, once redacted, will become available to the public, shedding light on the SEC's stance and proposed remedies against Ripple Labs.

James K. Filan, a prominent lawyer in the XRP community, announced the update via a post on X. According to Filan, the parties involved, SEC and Ripple Labs, have agreed to a timeline for making these documents public.

They plan to meet on March 25 to discuss the necessary redactions before filing a redacted version in the public docket by March 26. This step aligns with previous sealing requests made earlier in the week, aiming to protect sensitive information while keeping the public informed.

Both parties have clearly outlined the process for redacting and filing these documents. After the SEC's initial filing, Ripple Labs will follow with its opposition next month. Specifically, XRP will file its opposition under seal on April 22.

Following a similar procedure, the parties will meet the next day to identify necessary redactions, with a public version of the opposition to be filed by April 24. This systematic approach ensures that while sensitive information remains protected, the public and interested stakeholders have access to the proceedings and arguments within this landmark case.

Furthermore, the SEC plans to file its reply to Ripple's opposition in the same manner. After filing under seal on May 6, redactions will be made by May 7, with the edited version submitted by May 8. These steps underscore the importance of confidentiality for certain details within the lawsuit, particularly concerning financial records and contracts related to Ripple's institutional XRP sales post-December 2020 complaint.

The legal confrontation began when Ripple was accused of selling $770 million worth of XRP to institutional clients without proper registration, a move considered by the SEC as a violation of securities law. The ongoing remedies phase could significantly impact Ripple, with speculations about the possible imposition of hefty penalties.

Some experts suggest penalties could reach up to $3 billion if Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) sales are deemed securities. However, predictions about the size of potential fines vary, with some believing that penalties might not exceed Ripple's legal expenses, estimated at around $200 million.

This lawsuit has financial implications not only for Ripple but also for the cryptocurrency market. The outcomes could set precedents for how digital assets are regulated and defined under U.S. securities law. As the parties prepare their redacted filings, stakeholders within and beyond the cryptocurrency community await further revelations. The meticulous process of redaction and public disclosure reflects the delicate balance between transparency and the protection of sensitive information in high-stakes legal battles.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.3098039215686275,448891842,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,eng-9409922

Makinde stated this in an interview on Channels Television's Politics Today on Friday.

The governor faulted 16 governors' submission of a report on the matter to the National Economic Council (NEC).

Recall that on Thursday, NEC confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police to address the myriads of security challenges facing the nation.

But, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Makinde said, ""I did not submit any memorandum on state police but my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time.

""I did not submit not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde said the issue of the state police can best be handled by the National Assembly and not the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

The governor said, ""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work. It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly and then at the state level, we get our state houses of assembly to pass this law.""

The calls for state police has been an age-long issue in Nigeria. But the worsening state of security in the country has heightened such calls.

Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on February 12 restated their position on state policing, as the solution to the country's worsening security situation.

Regional socio-political groups such as Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, and the Northern Elders' Forum, have repeatedly called for state police as a solution to the nation's increasing security challenges.

Some states in the South-West geopolitical zone have formed the Amotekun while their counterparts in the South-East also created a security outfit Ebube Agu.

The Benue Guards has also been operational in Benue State in the North Central while states like Katsina, Zamfara, and other bandit-prone sub-nationals have also come up with similar state-established outfits.

The outfits, however, are still seeking the backing of the Federal Government.

Legislation that would allow Delaweans to choose to be composted into soil instead of buried or cremated is headed to Gov. John Carney's desk.

It passed the state Senate Thursday after a spirited debate, with all of the Democrats and Republican Eric Buckson voting yes. The House approved it overwhelmingly in January.

The process is also known as natural organic reduction, which supporters say is a more environmentally-friendly ""death care option."" Like traditional cremation, the remains are returned to family members or whoever arranged for it.

Senate Sponsor Sen. Laura Sturgeon, D-Brandywine West, said the choice is already available in seven other states, and the soil will undergo extensive testing. Citing figures from those in the industry and government researchers, Sturgeon argued other internment options, such as burial and traditional cremation harm the earth and climate.

""Cremation is a fossil fuel-driven process, with each cremation emitting 535 pounds of carbon dioxide,"" she said. As for traditional burial, every year in the United States, we bury over 100,000 gallons of formaldehyde, 104,000 tons of steel, 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete, and 30 million board feet of hardwood.

Mohammed emphasised the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence

He noted that his call is not an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step geared towards ensuring that the social media platforms are held accountable.

Mohammed, who is also the Managing Partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, made the call at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos on Friday.

The theme of the event was ""Disinformation and misinformation: The media in the age of discontent"".

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of Social Media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Mohammed further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

He noted that social media remains a major space for proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching in the sense of undermining democratic processes, among others.

His words: ""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratised access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation.

""The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety. False narratives surrounding elections can trigger legitimacy problems for the winner.

Delivering his vision statement to the nation as flagbearer of the NPP, Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia announced that his government would introduce a new friendly tax regime aimed at boosting businesses and making the private sector competitive.

His plan includes introducing a flat tax system, granting tax amnesty, and eliminating human intervention in tax audits to foster a business-friendly environment.

Additionally, Dr Bawumia plans to abolish certain taxes, like the E-Levy, to promote a cashless economy and adjust importation rates and port charges to surpass regional competitors.

However, in a recent tweet dated March 22, 2024, Prof. Mensah highlighted the fiscal constraints that may hinder the implementation of such incentives, especially in an economy reliant on treasury bills for financing.

He doubted the feasibility of the vice president's proposed tax policies, suggesting that the government's limited financial leeway could be a significant obstacle.

""I don't think the vice president would have the fiscal space to grant the tax incentives he is promising Ghanaian businesses. It will be difficult to provide tax incentives in a country with treasury bills as the only source of financing,"" he posted.

Professor Lord Mensah's remarks join the conversation about the practicality of tax relief measures and their impact on the nation's economic strategy.

Meanwhile, Ghana's 2024 general elections are scheduled for December 7, 2024. This election will see Ghanaians vote for a new president and members of Parliament.

As the election approaches, there is a focus on various issues, including the economy, infrastructure development, and social policies.

The Marijuana Board of South Africa (MBOSA) wants to delay the signing of the Cannabis for Private Purposes Bill as they argue that in its current form it fails to meet their needs and lacks clarity about uses.

These concerns were raised at the sixth Marijuana Friendly Indaba, an event hosted on Human Rights Day, March 21, by MBOSA, at the Kempton Park Council Chamber, which allowed activists and enthusiast to ventilate their concerns.

The group plans to host a nationwide protest on the 4 May 2024, just 25 days before the national presidential election.

Beyond concerns, the indaba had a panel of speakers facilitating conversations on cannabis cultivation, consumption and community empowerment.

A range of issues also came from the floor, including but not limited to: the history of cannabis in South Africa, the economic empowerment of traditional cannabis farmers and indigenous communities and building relationships between community stakeholders like traditional healers and the South African Police Service.

Chairperson of the Cannabis Development Council of South Africa, Ras Garreth Prince, wrote a letter to the President Cyril Ramaphosa to reject the bill. In it, he urges Ramaphosa to not sign the bill, and send it back to parliament.

""The current iteration of the bill falls short of constitutional standards and fails to address the legitimate interests of the cannabis community,"" emphasised Prince.

The letter written by him was accepted by the Indaba, as confirmed by Ras Thapelo Khunou, secretary of MBOSA, during the resolutions of the indaba.

The organisers of the protest, Dave Sewell and Candice Nel extended the invitation to all, ""it's inclusive of everyone, nobody's excluded,"" said the pair.

The call was part of issues that emanated from a tax awareness march held on Friday in Abakaliki, the state capital.

The event, at the Margaret Umahi International Market, was organised by Neighbourhood Initiative for Women Advancement, a civil society organisation, in collaboration with Tax Justice and Governance Platform with support from Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre and OXFAM.

Speaking during the event, the Lead Director, Neighbourhood Initiative for Women Advancement, Nancy Oko Onya, regretted that the tax system in the state often places heavy burden on the poor and low income earners.

She called for proper assessment before taxation to avoid crippling budding business activities in the state with its resultant economic hardship on the citizens.

Onya, who is also the Ebonyi State Host, Tax Justice and Governance Platform, called for total automation of revenue collection in the state to address the issue of leakages.

She maintained that cooperation between the citizens and government would enhance revenue accruable to the government for development while restoring the confidence of taxpayers.

She added that mutual antagonism on tax matters between government and citizens would be drastically reduced when the government uses tax revenues to address citizens' basic needs as well as encourage tax drivers to respect the human rights of citizens.

Onya emphasised: ""Also we have been advocating against using third parties to collect revenues, contractors who are not trained with their untrained boys as task forces.

""This has caused fights and conflicts on a regular basis.

""Most times there are no tax assessments by revenue officers, making people to be taxed above their earning capacities.

""I think it is high time both the government and the civil society organisations, including the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigeria Labour Congress teamed up to ask questions and have tax education in the state.

""Let's have tax grievance redress mechanism.""

While commending Governor Francis Nwifuru for recently inaugurating the state Revenue Appeal Commission and his directive to spare petty traders from market taxes, Onya called on the commission to make itself accessible to the populace as well as establish appropriate channels of communication for addressing concerns on taxpayers.

She said: ""We call on the newly-inaugurated Revenue Appeal Commission to have a relationship with the citizens, create awareness about their existence, and how the citizens can access them.

""They should not only focus on serving the government's interests.

""We are talking about tax justice, we are talking about equity, we are talking about distribution of resources generated in the state.

""The Commission should also play a part in that.

""It shouldn't only be about collecting revenue, but also about what you do with the revenue collected.

""It should be about tax for service.:

The Ebonyi State Coordinator, National Human Rights Commission, Chris Okorie, acknowledged that tax payment by citizens was necessary for development in any society, but cautioned that the process of revenue drive and collection should have a human face, respecting the rights of citizens.

Okorie emphasised that the Commission was ready to organise training for revenue collectors in the state to enhance their approach to revenue drive.

Others who spoke, including Fidelis Mbam, the Chairman, Lot 3 Traders Union, appealed to the government and its revenue agents to avoid imposing multiple taxes on them.

Mbam also asked that revenue accruing to the government through the various taxes should be properly utilised in providing tangible basic amenities in the market and for the entire citizenry.

He expressed optimism that the present administration in the state would address their concerns.

Prior to the event, NIWA and its partners had carried out advocacy visits to relevant government Ministries, Departments and Agencies with the message of enthroning tax justice in the state.

A division bench of Justice Yashwant Varma and Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav said that the Income Tax Department ""appears to have collated substantial and concrete evidence warranting further scrutiny and examination"" under the Income Tax Act.

The bench also remarked that the Congress had approached it at the ""proverbial fag end of the proceedings"". The Income Tax Department's reassessment is scheduled to be completed by March 31.

The Congress said on Thursday that the Income Tax department had frozen all its bank accounts ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

On March 19, the party had approached the Delhi High Court again, challenging the Income Tax Department's order to reopen assessment proceedings for the financial years 2014-'15, 2015-'16 and 2016-'17.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Congress, challenged the proceedings under Section 153C of the Income Tax Act, which pertains to the assessment of the income of any person or party.

Singhvi said that the section would have, at best, allowed for a reassessment of the Congress' tax records for the years 2017-'18 to 2020-'21. He said that the three additional fiscal years of 2014-'15, 2015-'16 and 2016-'17 would be ""barred by limitation"".

The stakeholders' also agreed to leverage on structures and platforms of partners to assist ECOSGF and AfriTAL in the enlightenment of communities and policymakers in the various states of the project, while Integrating ways of handling human and agricultural waste into educational curriculums.

Speaking at the occasion, the Executive Director at AfriTAL, Dr. Louis Brown Ogbeifun, stated that the project would focus on decreasing methane emissions from anthropogenic sources such as human wastes, landfills, the rearing of ruminant animals, rice cultivation, and other agricultural processes.

He noted that, from the information gathered so far, there is a lack of knowledge about anthropogenic methane and its hazards to human health.

He stressed that Nigeria's methane emissions situation is more precarious because methane emissions from oil and gas activities like gas flares, pipeline vandalism, artisanal refining, etc., are already high; hence, CSOs must advocate for its curtailment as soon as possible.

He presented the scope of the initial methane abatement in Nigeria project to be carried out with a particular focus on anthropogenic causes within four pilot states in Nigeria, namely, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Delta, and Rivers states in the Niger Delta, including:

* Equipping CSOs and the Media with knowledge and advocacy tools for ""Methane Action;""

* Encouraging governmental entities to be more proactive in methane abatement and

* Increased awareness and interest by farmers and livestock owners on the effect of improperly disposed wastes and their impacts on humans.

In his presentation, Rev. Fr. Edward Obi, MSP, a Director with the Environmental Centre for Oil Spillage and Gas Flaring, stressed that CSOs could do a lot to lessen the impact of global warming, and he was happy to be a part of the methane abatement project.

He reiterated that 60% of global methane emissions come from anthropogenic sources, especially agriculture, citing examples from cows' feeding habits.

To bolster the need for urgency in methane abatement, he played a video, ""Meet the Methane, the Invisible Climate Villain"" which shows that emissions from 1 landfill in Beuno Aires cause an equivalent to pollution from 1.4 million cars, stressing that the project is timely in addressing the issue of climate change.

In attendance at the stakeholders' meeting were the Center for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD), Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN), We the People (WTP), MarkDeen Agro, Peace Point Development Foundation (PPDF), Healthy Life Development Initiative (HLDI), Care and Development Centre (CADEC), MAO Media, Gaden City Radio, and Africa Independent

After some thrilling upsets, and some questionable calls, it is nice to see what we have in store for us with this round. There are a couple of games today where I'd expect the ""Cinderella Story"" to end, and somewhere I think we might get another upset. However, for me, I've focused in on this one as we have one of the top seeds in the tournament looking to make it to next week against one of the more storied college basketball programs. Let's see what we can cook up for the game between #9 Michigan State and #1 North Carolina.

Tom Izzo knows how to navigate a season. This was one of the more interesting ones that I can remember for him. They entered the year as a highly-ranked squad and quickly lost that designation - in fact, I don't think they were ranked again this year after they lost their ranking. A quick note about that, because it is interesting based on who they play today: North Carolina was the #1 ranked team in the nation to start the year last season, and they didn't even make the tournament. Now they are a #1 seed in this year's tournament with a similar team. I bring this up because it showcases that the team has talent, even if the season didn't start out well. Either way, they've made it here now and they took care of business against Mississippi State in their first game. It wasn't much of a contest as the Spartans beat them by 18 points. That won't be the case in this game, but don't be too surprised if Michigan State can potentially pull off an upset. The Spartans are a guard-heavy team, but they've held their own against some of the bigger body teams in the Big 10. They played Purdue in the Big 10 Conference Tournament and kept that game close. They lost to Wisconsin and Illinois three out of four matchups. They did beat Illinois in Michigan 88-80. They also played Duke, an ACC team, and lost that game, but again, that was early in the season when they were clearly trying to figure things out.

North Carolina is one of the teams that I like for winning the championship this season. That isn't a bold prediction considering they are a #1 seed, but they are playing with the motivation of taking care of business from last season, and they have a good team. Sometimes, motivation can only take you so far, but the talent the Tar Heels have shouldn't be underestimated. North Carolina came into the tournament off of a surprising loss to North Carolina State in the ACC Championship game. That might be a blessing in disguise for the team as they were rolling with eight straight wins prior to that loss. Now they should be completely focused and not take anything for granted in the game. The three-headed monster of a team that they have is enough to beat the majority of the teams in this tournament until maybe the Final Four. Very few people have been able to stop RJ Davis as he continues to rack up points. Armando Bacot reels in rebounds and gets putbacks against opponents with relative ease. And, Harrison Ingram does a lot of the dirty work and provides a nice balance of floor spacing, scoring, and rebounding for the team.

Sometimes games just look off. Michigan State is good, well-coached, has talent, and is playing well right now. All of those things matter in the tournament. However, North Carolina is a better team and has better players. That may not always matter under the bright lights and center stage, but a few of them have been in this before. I like the Tar Heels in this game at -3.5 and think they should win this game by probably at least seven or eight points. I'll back UNC to continue their march toward redemption.",outkick.com,news,OutKick,David Troy,0.0980392156862746,448888902,1,https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/03/rj-davis-unc.jpg,eng-9412763

Former Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has called for the regulation of social media to tackle anti-state groups, anarchists, and other ""harmful entities"" in the country.

Mohammed emphasized the need for stricter oversight of social media platforms to prevent them from being exploited by those seeking to undermine the government and incite violence.

He noted that his call was not an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices, but a step geared towards ensuring that the social media platforms were held accountable.

Mohammed, who is also the Managing Partner of Bruit Cosaud, a policy advisory firm, made the call at the iRepresent International Documentary Festival, which forms part of activities to mark the 90th birthday anniversary of Prof. Wole Soyinka, in Lagos on Friday.

The theme of the event was ""Disinformation and Misinformation: The Media in the Age of Discontent"".

He said: ""Let me state here that I support the calls for the regulation of social media. However, regulation of social media should not be misconstrued as an attempt to stifle freedom of expression or censor dissenting voices.

""Rather, it should be viewed as a necessary step to ensure that these platforms operate in a manner that is responsible, ethical, and conducive to the well-being of society.""

Mohammed further urged the current administration to take action against social media companies that allow misleading information to circulate unchecked.

According to Mohammed, the unchecked spread of fake news and hate speech on social media has become a serious threat to national security, with anti-state groups using these platforms to spread propaganda and incite public unrest.

He warned that this trend could have dire consequences for the stability of the country and called for decisive action to address the issue.

He noted that social media remained a major space for proliferation of fake news, adding that the consequences of disinformation and misinformation were far-reaching in undermining democratic processes, among others.

He said: ""Social media remains the platform of choice for the purveyors of fake news, anti-state groups, anarchists, secessionists, terrorists and bandits. It's either on Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. With a smartphone and data, people can broadcast whatever they want with ease.

""Similarly, through technology and inventions, the challenge has even become exponential through the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning techniques to create highly realistic fake or manipulated videos, audio recordings or images.

""These creations often involve superimposing existing images or videos onto other contents, making it appear as though individuals are saying or doing things they never did. This is era of deepfake!

""There is no doubt that the proliferation of digital media platforms has transformed the landscape of information dissemination the world over. While these platforms have democratized access to information, they have also provided fertile ground for the spread of falsehoods and manipulation. The rapid circulation of misinformation, fueled by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, has led to a crisis of trust in traditional media institutions.

""The consequences of disinformation and misinformation are far-reaching. They undermine democratic processes, sow discord within communities, and pose significant threats to public health and safety. False narratives surrounding elections can trigger legitimacy problems for the winner.

""There were conspiracy theories fueling vaccine hesitancy as witnessed during the COVID 19 pandemic among other consequences of fake news. The impact of misinformation can be devastating, exacerbating existing fault-lines and hindering collective action.""

He, however, cleared the air on why ex-President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration suspended the services of Twitter (now X), stating that the move was to check the nefarious activities of some groups bent on promoting anarchy.

""We were compelled to suspend the services of Twitter, now X, when it became evident that Twitter had yielded its platform to proscribed groups, who were bent on promoting anarchy and destabilizing the country,"" he added.",dailytrust.com,news,Daily Trust,,0.1686274509803922,448888835,1,https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lai-mohammed.jpg,eng-9420039

What happened to the separation of church and state in Florida?

As if universal vouchers for parents sending their children to private religious schools was not enough, we're now giving precious tax dollars to a private Christian school (Palm Beach Atlantic) for its LeMieux Center to ""promote reasoned, civil discourse and public policy.""

(Re: Lawmakers stuff state budget with local projects, by Anthony Man, Sun Sentinel)

I read that as brainwashing -- the very thing that Gov. DeSantis complains about because it may have a progressive slant in public schools.

So not only have all progressives been purged from our institutions of higher learning, but we now promote the exact opposite with public money in private schools. When will this end?

When will the courts start enforcing a clear requirement that religion and the state must be separate? It's time for thoughtful citizens to wake up and exert some influence over an out-of-control state Legislature.

The party of ""local control"" now has its unelected Board of Education meddling in a lawsuit involving the Broward County School Board's allocation of locally referendum-provided funds.

Leaving aside the fact that charter schools are somehow exempt from several public school requirements concerning educational standards and teacher qualification, even though they are classified as public schools, the Board of Education has clearly overstepped, as School Board Member Allen Zeman noted this week.

Broward school officials should resist this unwarranted state intervention in a local matter.

Steve Bousquet's latest opinion column about the Palm Beach County Democratic Party was disappointing (For Palm Beach Democrats, a steep uphill climb, March 17).

He accuses Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried of ""public shaming"" in the suspension of Mindy Koch as party chair. But what is his column if not a public shaming of Fried, Palm Beach Democratic Party Acting Chair Sean Rourk, and all the local Democratic committee members who, for more than a year, have urged the state party to help us with our internal affairs?

Bousquet also uses a horrible term, ""MAGA-left,"" in his article to refer to people that addressed our problems with Koch. He is talking about loyal Democrats whose only sin, apparently, is not airing the other side of the story to the news media.

For shame. Let's not stoop to talk with him.

I want to reassure his readers that Palm Beach County Democrats, on both sides of the Koch controversy, are out there doing the work, cooperating with each other and yes, respecting each other.

We must win the November election for President Biden and send more Democrats to Tallahassee to address the human needs of Floridians.

In reply to a letter to the editor on March 18, let me say that ""only a fool or a liar"" would support Donald Trump.

President Joe Biden has accomplished more in three years than any president in the past 50 years accomplished in his entire first term.

To the issue about the southern border, let me remind readers that it is Congress that writes the laws, not the president. There was a good proposal regarding the border, torpedoed by Trump so he would have something to run on in November.

""Only a fool or a liar"" would not recognize that Trump was the worse president in U.S. history.

Even conservative historians agree. Experts responding to the survey who self-identified as conservatives ranked Biden No. 30 in the list of presidents, while liberals put him 13th and moderates ranked him 20th.

All three of the same groups ranked Trump, whose presidency was marked by his flouting of historical norms, in the bottom five, right down there with James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson.",sun-sentinel.com,news,SunSentinel,,0.1686274509803922,448888748,1,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/01/08/YILQSHOXWNHFBKOKYVRZYWKCMI.jpg?w=640,eng-9415447

With less than a month left until Tax Day, you may wonder if it's time to file your taxes instead of waiting on an uncertain bill, or if you should wait a bit longer if you're claiming the credit. We'll help you find out what's going and what you should do.

The child tax credit -- both the current credit and the one stalled in the Senate -- is partially refundable, meaning that for a part of the credit you can get a refund even if you don't owe any tax. The remainder is nonrefundable, so you can use that part of the tax credit only against taxes you owe. We'll explain the requirements that must be met to be eligible for the child tax credit in 2024.

Find out below whether you should wait to file, if you're eligible for the child tax credit in 2024 and how much money you could get. For more tax tips, here are this year's filing deadlines and our picks for the best tax software. Here's when you can expect to receive your child tax credit refund this year.

The maximum tax credit available per kid is $2,000 for each child under 17 on Dec. 31, 2023. Only a portion is refundable this year, up to $1,600 per child.

For tax year 2021, the expanded child tax credit was $3,600 for children five and under, and $3,000 for children ages six to 17. That's no longer the case. The age requirement was also temporarily extended to under 18 on Dec. 31, but that's also gone.

To be eligible for the tax break this year, you and your family must meet these requirements:

Go to the IRS website for more information.

If your MAGI is higher than the income limits, the amount of child tax credit you receive will decrease by $50 for every $1,000 above the limit. For example, a MAGI of $210,000 as an individual would allow you to claim $1,500 for each eligible child.

The child tax credit is phased out completely at $240,000 for individuals and $480,000 for married couples filing jointly.

Note: If you search online for information on the child tax credit, you may come across details on the 2021 expanded tax breaks, so double-check that you're viewing the most recent information.

Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at Jackson-Hewitt, says many government sites keep historical information live ""for people playing catch-up with their taxes.""

As part of a massive COVID-19 aid package, Congress in 2021 temporarily expanded the child tax credit, which helped drive child poverty to a record low. Congress didn't extend the expanded credit in 2022, and the credit returned to its pre-pandemic rate.

If approved, the new rules around the $2,000 child tax credit would be more modest and cover three tax years: 2023, 2024 and 2025. That means if it's approved you could claim the expanded credit this tax season when you file your 2023 tax returns.

As proposed right now, the new child tax credit would continue to be partially refundable (so, for a part of the credit you could get a refund even if you didn't owe any tax) and the new rules would increase the maximum refundable amount per child from $1,600 per child to $1,800 in tax year 2023, to $1,900 in tax year 2024 and to $2,000 in tax year 2025, with the 2024 and 2025 amounts adjusted for inflation.

The remainder of the $2,000 after the refundable amount ($200 for tax year 2023) would be nonrefundable, so you could use the tax credit only against taxes you owe -- after your tax bill hits $0, you won't get additional money.

Although the proposed changes have cleared the House, it's up in the air whether the Senate will approve the bill. Until the legislation is actually signed into law, you may wonder if you should hold off on filing your tax return.

IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said don't wait. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on Feb. 15, Werfel said, ""Taxpayers should not wait for this legislation to file their returns. We will take care of getting any additional refunds to taxpayers who have already filed. They won't need to take additional steps,"" such as filing an amended return.

On Feb. 21, the IRS released a statement saying they will ""automatically make adjustments for those who have already filed so no additional action will be needed by those eligible taxpayers.""

Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at Intuit, maker of TurboTax, said there are other reasons to file now because other credits are available for parents beyond the child tax credit that they can take advantage of, such as the earned income tax credit.

Always consult with your tax advisor for your individual tax needs.

You can claim the child tax credit by entering your eligible children on your Form 1040 and attaching a completed Schedule 8812, Credits for Qualifying Children and Other Dependents.

The child tax credit this year isn't fully nonrefundable. That means that if your tax liability exceeds what you get from the credit, you forfeit the difference.

You may still be able to claim the additional child tax credit, which refunds up to $1,600 per child. (To see if you qualify for the additional child tax credit, fill out the worksheet for IRS Form 8812.)

If you paid for childcare, you may also qualify for the child and dependent care credit. Depending on your circumstances, you can declare 20% to 35% of your childcare expenses.

The maximum you can claim is $3,000 for one child under 13 or a dependent with disabilities, or $6,000 for two or more.

You are required to have earned income to qualify for this credit and the care for your children must not have been provided by a spouse or family member.

Costello, who was in Congress from 2015 to 2019, estimated there is a 55% chance some form of the legislation will eventually be passed. However, he doubts China-based ByteDance (BDNCE) would divest from TikTok -- as the legislation requires -- which would ultimately result in TikTok being forced out of the country.

H.R. 7521 breezed through the U.S. House of Representatives on March 13, receiving wide bipartisan support with a vote of 352-65-1 in favor of the bill.

President Biden has already indicated he will sign H.R. 7521 into law if it reaches his desk.

The bill targets the ""threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications, such as TikTok and any successor application or service and any other application or service developed or provided by ByteDance.""

""This bipartisan legislation is needed to protect our national security and the privacy of American consumers,"" said U.S. Congresswoman Shontel Brown (D-Ohio). ""There are clear and legitimate concerns about applications subject to control by our foreign adversaries. It is imperative Congress take action to protect the public, young and old.""

One week after H.R. 7521 passed the House, the legislative body passed a second bill, the Protecting Americans' Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024 (H.R. 7520), unanimously.

H.R. 7520, which is related to H.R. 7521, would prohibit data brokers from selling Americans' sensitive personal information to foreign adversaries.

The U.S. Senate is expected to review both bills together, with a vote occurring within the next two months, Costello said.

However, these bills will likely be modified before they hit the Senate floor, Costello said. For instance, more clarification might be needed regarding the definition of a ""foreign adversary"" or the term ""data broker"" may need further classification, the former Congressman said.

Also, the House version calls for TikTok to divest from ByteDance within 180 days.

The rejection of a federal housing grant could mean a larger-than-expected tax increase for West Kelowna taxpayers.

According to a report going to city council Tuesday, West Kelowna's application for the federal Housing Accelerator Fund was not approved.

The fund aims to stimulate housing development -- Kelowna received $31.5M -- and West Kelowna had intended on using the funding to add staff to its strained planning department.

In his report, interim city manager Ron Mattiussi says West Kelowna is being obligated to undertake ""a significant amount of policy work"" to meet provincial and municipal objectives related to housing.

""As a result, the long range planning department is experiencing unprecedented pressures related to meeting the changing landscape of housing policy, funding opportunities, pro-active planning and community expectations,"" Mattiussi said.

While city council was aggressive in minimizing the growth of the headcount of municipal staff during budget talks, Mattiussi's report suggests more employees are needed.

""In order to ensure development application timelines are not impacted, additional resources are required to guide and facilitate the department's workplan and will ensure long term sustainability of master planning activities, which are coordinated with other departmental goals,"" Mattiussi said.

""This will ensure the city can meet provincial requirements, as well as council's strategic priorities which focus on investment in infrastructure, as well as economic growth and prosperity.""

The three positions needed by the city, at the minimum, are a long range planning manager, an infrastructure engineer and a GIS analyst. The three roles come with an annual cost of $377,145, which equates to a 0.907% tax increase over and above what council 6.85% tax increase tentatively approved in December

The Thompson-Nicola Regional District finalized its annual budget and five-year financial plan Thursday, approving an 8.3 per cent tax increase, down slightly from the 8.9 per cent pegged in December.

Despite the hike, growth in the property tax base across the TNRD means many property owners will see a lower-percentage increase or even a decrease in taxes owing this year, depending on assessed value of their property, a press release from the regional district stated.

The TNRD will collect about $2 million more in taxes this year over last between its 10 electoral areas and 11 municipalities -- $27.2 million in 2024 from $25.1 million in 2023.

A new five-year solid waste and recycling contract, an increase in the annual grant-in-aid program budget, temporary resources in 2024 for the finance and facilities departments, a new staff position to support cybersecurity, a remuneration increase for firefighters at the nine TNRD fire departments and wage increases for BCGEU employees and the board of directors have contributed to the 2024 tax requisition increase.

""Our staff departments have made a concerted effort to reduce expenses and other costs where possible while maintaining consistent service levels,"" TNRD Chief Administrative Officer Scott Hildebrand said in a news release.

He told the board the TNRD continues to find ways to bring more consistent and predictable budgets and taxation.

""We are fully aware that a tax increase like this is not something that we can sustain long term,"" he said.

The half per cent shaved off the tax increase this year is due to a number of tweaks to the budget since December, chief financial officer Carla Fox told the board.

Those include incorporating the 2023 year-end surplus, wage adjustments, use of grant revenue, changes to funding waste facilities in Area J, N and P and reducing Destination BC grant revenue and expenses from $34,000 to $10,000.

Reserve funds in the budget are about $39.5 million and projected to hit $47.5 million by 2028, while the surplus sits at $4.5 million in 2024 -- down $2.9 million from the $7.4 million it was two years ago.

Large capital projects in the 2024 budget include a cemetery expansion in Blue River, an upgrade to the Clearwater Library, eco-depot upgrades in Lower Nicola, water treatment plants in Pritchard and Paul Lake and new fire trucks in Vavenby, Tobiano Pritchard, Monte Creek, McClure, Little Fort and Blackpool. A new fire hall for Monte Creek and a new station in Tobiano are also on the books.

In total, TNRD capital and operating budgets are $85.9 million.

The thinking is that if we all just hunker down and get through this period of pain, the bank will meet its 2% inflation target and we'll all start to feel better off.

Except, for some of us, this isn't our experience at all. For millionaires like me, who own our homes outright, the decisions of the MPC make virtually no difference to our outgoings. Free from the shackles of high borrowing rates, we're able to spend to our hearts' content. In fact, for those with cash in the bank, higher interest rates actively boost income and spending power. There is cash to be spent on original artworks to decorate their several homes; and travel between residences, adding to both the climate and housing crises.

It is this unshackled spending of the very wealthiest that is keeping rates for everyone else so high. And don't just take my word for it - take MPC member Catherine Mann's comments. As long as the richest have so much spare cash, everyone else will have to feel the squeeze in a ""collective"" effort to bring down inflation. In the meantime, high rates mean the wealthiest see a nice boost to their savings - the top 10% are expected to receive 65% of the £90bn in household savings in 2024-2025.

How can it be that in the middle of an unprecedented fall in living standards, the people who can least afford to pay for the inflation crisis are being told it is their spending that needs to be curbed? Not only is this counterintuitive (how can you curb the demand of families who already have so little disposable income?) - it is completely unfair.

Instead, as the campaign group Stop the Squeeze has argued, we need a response to the cost of living crisis that tackles the structural inequalities that got us into this mess, not one that entrenches them.

Let's start with our broken tax system. We continue to hear about how high our taxes are, but the truth is that while our system disproportionately taxes the vast majority who get their income from work, those who are already wealthy from investments, rent and inheritances are taxed relatively lightly. Our own prime minister, who earned more than £2m last year and is married to a billionaire, pays the same effective tax rate as a teacher.

The good news is, there are plenty of ways to address this imbalance. Equalising rates of capital gains tax with income tax, so that income from wealth is taxed at the same level as income from work, would raise £16.7bn a year. Removing loopholes and reliefs from inheritance tax would raise around £1bn a year. Applying national insurance more consistently across all forms of income could raise over £30bn a year. And an annual tax on stocks of wealth would raise nearly £12bn a year. Together, a package of higher taxes on wealth could raise billions to fund cost of living support in the short term and provide essential public goods such as a strong social safety net and clean, affordable energy provision in the future.

As a member of the campaign group Patriotic Millionaires UK, I want rich people like me to pay our fair share of tax. And I'm not alone. Nearly 75% of millionaires also want higher taxes on wealth.

The Bank of England is right to want to curb inflation. But the idea of squeezing low- and middle-income earners so that millionaires can keep spending on luxury items isn't the way forward. We urgently need to tackle the root causes of the cost of living crisis, and we can start by introducing higher taxes on wealth.",todayheadline.co,news,TodayHeadline,Kathy D.

Denise Carey, the chief executive of the charity Home, believes that attention should be placed on tightening the laws.

Oversight and regulation of matters involving landlords and tenants in Bermuda is governed by several primary pieces of legislation, including those related to rent increases and rent apportionment.

In Home's annual report released last Tuesday, Ms Carey said Bermuda was facing a housing crisis and listed factors that have contributed to homelessness on the island.

She pointed out that a national register of landlords and rental agencies was needed for the island to establish a property portal that captures all social, affordable and rental accommodation in both social and private sectors in a centralised database.

""We have not put anything in place on what we need to do to strengthen landlord rights and tenant rights,"" she said. ""We need to strengthen the landlord and tenant legislation.""

Ms Carey noted that when a tenant was unable to pay rent or if a landlord believed that the tenant was not taking good care of the property, ""there should be early interventions, mediations that the landlord can reach out to before they head towards the court"".

Reference was made in the Throne Speech to landlord-tenant legislation and a possible amendment to existing law.

In November 2021, following the Throne Speech, Minister of Home Affairs Walter Roban said the landlord and tenant legislation had not been updated to match the evolution in the rental market since the 1990s.

""As in most jurisdictions, disputes between landlords and tenants have increased and legislation is needed to address these issues and provide adequate guidance and protection to landlords and tenants,"" he said.

Mr Roban said the economic impact suffered by residents ""highlighted the ambiguity"" in the current landlord and tenant laws and the need for updated legislation.

""A more comprehensive Act will enable Consumer Affairs to better assist landlords and tenants by giving clear guidance on settling rental disputes and potentially avoiding civil court,"" he noted.

Responsibility for enforcement of the landlord and tenancy laws falls on the courts. As such, Mr Roban said both parties had little option but to resort to the courts to settle disputes because of ""a lack of clear direction"" from the law.

""The court process can be long, is generally not user-friendly and can prove to be expensive with no guarantee of a positive outcome,"" he said.

Mr Roban said updated legislation would introduce emergency enforcement powers for Consumer Affairs, which could now only do its best to ""conciliate issues that arise but cannot enforce remedies"".

He said ""heinous acts"" had been committed by some landlords. The list include shutting water and electricity, removal of windows and doors as a way to force tenants to leave and putting tenants belongings out of the rental premises.

On the other hand, he said some tenants ""have indulged in illegal activities or engaged in intimidation against elderly landlords"".

Mr Roban said the occurrences ""require immediate intervention by an authority where there have been contraventions of the legislation"".",royalgazette.com,news,The Royal Gazette,,0.1529411764705881,448886956,1,https://imengine.editorial.prod.rgb.navigacloud.com/?uuid=92cde3c8-7815-5d9e-bd4d-636a3a7e8243&function=fit&type=preview,eng-9410404

Last time we checked in, the plutocrats in the executive suites were hard at work, securing further plunder through stock buybacks and access to the taxpayer teat. In return, they seeded the business press with fearful takes of perpetually soon-to-be-arriving recessions and slashed their workforces with layoffs. All the while, the ratio of CEO-to-worker pay kept on moving in the wrong direction.

It would be one thing if, alongside the exorbitant executive pay, the quality of American CEO-ing was going up. But these executives are making off with bigger bags of boodle despite their persistent incompetence: Media executives keep running their businesses into the ground, tech firms are laying people off because of vibes, the planes keep nearly crashing, and examples of insane eye-popping greed -- like Rite-Aid's decision to claw back severance paid out to laid-off workers on the same day they handed their CEO a $20 million bonus -- keep on coming.

Which firms are the worst of the worst? You can probably guess the company that tops the list because it's the one run by The New Republic's 2023 Scoundrel of the Year. During the five years of the study, Tesla took home $4.4 billion in profits as CEO Elon Musk carted off $2.28 billion in stock options, which, since his 2018 payday, have ballooned to nearly $56 billion -- a compensation plan so outlandish that the Delaware Court of Chancery canceled it. Tesla has, during that same period of time, paid an effective tax rate of zero percent through a combination of carrying forward losses from unprofitable years and good old-fashioned offshore tax dodging.

It's hard to match Tesla in terms of its rapaciousness, but the other nine firms on the IPS's ""Terrible Ten"" include some household names: T-Mobile, Netflix, Ford Motor Company, Metlife, and Darden Restaurants (owners of Olive Garden); a trio of energy companies (Nextera, Duke Energy, First Energy); and the shining star of the 2008 financial crisis, bailout baby AIG.

A new way to make an important ingredient for plastics, adhesives, carpet fibers, household cleaners, and more from natural gas could reduce manufacturing costs in a post-petroleum economy by millions of dollars, thanks to a new chemical reactor designed by University of Michigan engineers.

The reactor creates propylene, a workhorse chemical that is also used to make a long list of industrial chemicals, including ingredients for nitrile rubber found in automotive hoses and seals as well as blue protective gloves. Most propylene used today comes from oil refineries, which collect it as a byproduct of refining crude oil into gasoline.

As oil and gasoline fall out of vogue in favor of natural gas, solar, and wind energy, the production of propylene and other oil-derived products could fall below the current demand without new ways to make them.

Natural gas extracted from shale holds one potential alternative to propylene sourced from crude oil. It's rich in propane, which resembles propylene closely enough to be a promising precursor material, but current methods to make propylene from natural gas are still too inefficient to bridge the gap in supply and demand.

""It's very hard to economically convert propane into propylene,"" said Suljo Linic, the Martin Lewis Perl Collegiate Professor of Chemical Engineering and the corresponding author of the study published in Science.

""You need to heat that reaction to drive it, and standard methods require very high temperatures to produce enough propylene. At those temperatures, you don't just get propylene but solid carbon deposits and other undesirable products that impair the catalyst. To regenerate the reactor, we need to burn off the solid carbon deposits often, which makes the process inefficient.""

The researchers' new reactor system efficiently makes propylene from shale gas by separating propane into propylene and hydrogen gas. It also gives hydrogen a way out, changing the balance between the concentration of propane and reaction products in a way that allows more propylene to be made. Once separated, the hydrogen can also be safely burned away from the propane, heating the reactor enough to speed up the reactions without making any undesirable compounds.

This separation is achieved through the reactor's nested, hollow-fiber membrane tubing. The innermost tube is made up of materials that splits the propane into propylene and hydrogen gas. While the tubing keeps most of the propylene inside the innermost chamber, the hydrogen gas can escape into an outer chamber through pores in a membrane layer of the material. Inside that chamber, the hydrogen gas is controllably burned by mixing in precise amounts of oxygen.

Because the hydrogen can be burned inside the reactor and can operate under higher propane pressures, the technology could allow plants to produce propylene from natural gas without installing extra heaters. A plant that produces 500,000 metric tons of propylene annually could save as much as $23.5 million over other methods starting with shale gas, according to the researchers' estimates. Those savings come on top of the operational savings from burning hydrogen produced in reaction, rather than other fuels.

The SNP leader will be joined by Inverclyde MP Ronnie Cowan and the area's MSP Stuart McMillan.

Inverclyde was the one of the last council areas in Scotland to agree to the council tax freeze, with an agreement being reached earlier this week.

Along with Argyll and Bute, the local authority initially sought to defy the Scottish Government's bid to freeze the levy but an agreement was reached earlier this week.

Inverclyde Council leader, Labour's Stephen McCabe, said the decision to go along with the Government's policy was made reluctantly.

The policy of maintaining council tax at current levels was made by Yousaf at the SNP conference last October.

It led to months of negotiations between the government and councils on how much they should be compensated.

Poverty campaigners have said the freeze offers little to low-income families but the First Minister has said it will help households with the cost of living.

Ahead of the visit to Inverclyde, Yousaf said: ""In October last year I promised a national council tax freeze for households across Scotland and that is what the SNP is delivering.

""Despite Labour's attempts to stop people in Inverclyde from receiving this support, I am delighted that we are succeeding in delivering it.

""Council tax bills will be effectively frozen in all 32 local authorities next year.

""Council tax bills in Scotland are already hundreds of pounds a year lower than they are in England and this fully-funded council tax freeze gives people even more relief whilst they grapple with increased costs.""

He added: ""So while Westminster is forcing people to pay the price of broken Brexit Britain and economic mismanagement, the SNP is taking action where we can to protect household budgets.

On Wednesday, March 20, Dr Bawumia attributed this issue to the GRA's imposition of unattainable targets on its officers, leading to excessive taxation of existing businesses.

However, in a press release dated March 22, the Union explained that this 'unfortunate' comment undermines the hard work of the GRA staff who have contributed to the growth of tax collection in the country.

""We would like to state unequivocally that, we the workers of GRA find this statement unfortunate and consider it as an attack on the efforts of the hardworking staff of the Authority which if not discontinued, would incur the displeasure of workers, disrupt revenue collection efforts and breed industrial disharmony,"" the Union said.

They added that ""we wish to place on record that the unprecedented growth in Tax revenue collected in 2023 which yielded in excess of GH₵113bn is a major factor that has kept Ghana in the IMF bailout program. It is also an undeniable fact that the GRA has since the 2020 fiscal year met and in some cases exceeded the annual revenue targets despite the challenges of COVID-19.""

The Union insisted that it is unfair for Dr Bawumia to suggest that the GRA itself gives unrealistic targets to businesses when the Ministry of Finance assigns annual targets of revenue collection for them.

""Indeed, the least we expect from the Vice President, if he would not appreciate the efforts of the Authority in raising Tax Revenue, is not to put the lives of our hardworking staff at risk with such unfortunate comments,"" they added.

This comes after Dr Bawumia during a meeting with the Ghana Chamber of Commerce and Industry members, on Wednesday, highlighted the limitations of Ghana's narrow tax system, noting that it often burdens the same businesses and taxpayers with various taxes.

""They are harassing businesses. That harassment is coming from the sort of targets that are created at their office. They are setting unrealistic targets. And this is because the tax base is so narrow, you say to them, 'this is your target for this month', and they are trying to figure out where do I go.""

""Then for them, it is very easy, you go back to where you had it the last time. You go to taxpayers, the people who are already paying taxes and then you have to come up with a new reason why they should pay more and so you come up with all sorts of stuff,"" he said.

Dr. Bawumia has thus committed himself to implementing a flat tax rate in 2025 and offering tax amnesty to all businesses once he assumes office.

However, the GRA staff stressed that the GRA administers tax per laws enacted by the Parliament of Ghana and not based on the whims and caprices of the workers.

""We also call on the President of the Republic of Ghana, H.E. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the GRA Board, Civil Society organizations and all well-meaning Ghanaians to admonish political functionaries to desist from making such pronouncements and intervene swiftly as this statement possesses a major risk to revenue mobilization efforts going forward.""

That's left accountants, lawyers and financial advisors hoping their interpretation matches the government's. ""Uncertainty is not good,"" he said.

And because no one has filed a return for a bare trust before this year, few know what qualifies as one.

""If I say we're at a party and I ask you to hold my beer for me, that's a bare trust,"" Oakey joked. (A bare trust is when one person holds the title of something for another person with no beneficial ownership.)

The bare trust uncertainty is just one of many issues that make the Canadian tax system difficult to grasp.

""It's easy to get a consensus around the need for tax reform. It's very difficult to get a consensus around what the reformed tax system should look like,"" said Fred O'Riordan, EY Canada's national leader for tax policy.

Since Canada's last tax reform was enacted in 1972, tax professionals have found ways around each update to the Income Tax Act. Then, amendments intended to close those loopholes further increase the tax system's complexity, O'Riordan said.

""There's so much complexity in the [tax] system that even professionals are more than likely making mistakes,"" Oakey said.

That creates challenges for the average taxpayer. To build a more equitable system, experts say the system needs more simplicity -- and the government should reconsider whether the CRA is best positioned to distribute benefits to vulnerable Canadians.

The CRA used to just be a tax enforcement and collection agency, but its role now includes wealth redistribution as the government relies on the agency to distribute benefit programs, Oakey said. The CRA has grown from 42,000 employees in 2016 to nearly 60,000 in 2024.

""I was alive when you got family allowance checks and they ... had nothing to do with the income tax system,"" said Kim Moody, founder of Calgary-based tax firm Moodys Private Client. ""But they abandoned that and they put it right into the tax system.""

Many vulnerable Canadians miss out on benefits because they are either too intimidated to file taxes or can't afford to pay for professional tax preparation, Moody said. ""The average person right now can't approach a person like me. I'm too expensive, and that's not right. In a perfect world, I wouldn't have a job.""

Even if Canadians file for benefits, they might not get it right. A taxpayer may risk reassessment if they misunderstand a rule, file incorrectly or claim a benefit they didn't qualify for, Oakey said. The CRA is trying to claw back billions that were distributed to people who were ineligible for pandemic-related benefits, for example.

The consequences of filing an incorrect return could include interest on penalties and even imprisonment, said Philip Lawrence, Conservative MP and associate shadow minister for finance and middle class prosperity for tax reform.

Filing for benefits is even more complicated for couples, who face a blended system where each person files individually but benefits are allocated as a family with inconsistent rules, Oakey said. For example, while couples can choose which spouse claims the medical expense tax credit, the childcare credit must be allocated to the lower-income spouse.

""You either go all the way [for individual filing or] make it a family taxation unit,"" Oakey said. ""We're in a much more complicated situation by trying to blend the two of them.""

At the opposite end of the spectrum, high marginal tax rates are disincentivizing productivity. The highest marginal federal/provincial tax rate is more than 50% in all but two provinces.

Shifting government revenue from income taxes to consumption taxes like the GST could help boost productivity, especially as mechanisms such as the GST/HST credit exist to refund a portion of consumption tax to lower-income taxpayers, Moody said.

Lower marginal tax rates also could entice high income earners to stay in Canada rather than relocate to lower-tax jurisdictions, Oakey said.

Jurisdictional concerns also affect tax reform, as consultation with provinces is another complicating factor. Many provincial tax acts make references to the federal income tax act, Oakey said. For example, Ontario's Income Tax Act makes more than 300 references to its federal counterpart.

""You will either want to get the provinces to agree with what you're doing, or you just go alone and then leave the provinces to make whatever corrections they want,"" Oakey said.

They're sometimes confusing, often complex, and, depending on your worldview, necessary.

For context, if you're not sure what a mill levy is, it's the tax rate that is applied to the assessed value of a property. One mill is one dollar per $1,000 of assessed value.

The Topeka Capital-Journal's Jason Alatidd reports Kansas Republicans are advancing plans to abolish an unfunded program intended to help local governments provide property tax relief. Instead of putting money into the local ad valorem tax reduction fund for the first time in two decades, Republican lawmakers would formally end the program and put money toward cutting state property taxes.

Republicans, Alatidd reports, say abolishing the fund called LAVTRF would essentially provide the same amount of tax relief as cutting state mill levies. Kansas stopped funding the LAVTRF in 2004 because the state was in a budget crunch.

Alatidd reports Senate Bill 94 would eliminate the 1.5 mills combined for state building construction and maintenance. Additionally, House Bill 2815 would cut the 20 mills to 18 mills, then further cut it in the future as valuations rise in order to raise the same dollar amount of revenue.

But it's a bit more complicated than that.

It's disappointing the Legislature has ignored its funding mandate in recent decades. How loud do state legislators yell when federal funding mandates go unfulfilled?

Taking away this fund also provides no protection of funding to local governments that depend on them. If the state gets into another budget crisis, there's no guarantee local communities would get relief.

The Senate Republican plan to cut 1.5 mills would be about $35 in tax cuts on a $200,000 home. What a relief. That's practically two fast food combo meals. Its implications would impact government buildings, schools and other infrastructure. We can't overlook that.

A host of local government representatives lined up to oppose the House bill, ranging from counties to municipalities to school boards.

We need legislators to listen to their concerns and give them some consideration.

Perhaps the decision on the best way to address local property taxes should be made by local voices.

This seems like another time when the state decides it knows best -- and we know how much they hate it when federal leaders do that to them.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.04313725490196085,448885217,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

The Michigan State Spartans and the N. Carolina Tar Heels are set to clash at 5:30 p.m. ET on Saturday at Spectrum Center in a Big Ten postseason contest. The stakes are high as both teams are all in, both fighting to extend their postseason success.

Winning is just a little bit easier when your three-point shooting is a whole 21.3% better than the opposition, a fact Michigan State proved on Thursday. They strolled past the Bulldogs with points to spare, taking the game 69-51.

Among those leading the charge was Tyson Walker, who scored 19 points along with three steals. He didn't help Michigan State's cause all that much against Purdue on Friday but the same can't be said for this game. Another player making a difference was Jaden Akins, who scored 15 points along with seven rebounds.

Meanwhile, N. Carolina made the experts look like fools on Thursday, as the team pulled off a huge upset of Wagner. They took their match on the road with ease, bagging a 90-62 win over the Seahawks. N. Carolina's victory was all the more impressive since Wagner was averaging only 63.12 points allowed on the season.

N. Carolina's success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but Armando Bacot led the charge by dropping a double-double on 20 points and 15 rebounds. Bacot hasn't dropped below ten rebounds for four straight games. The team also got some help courtesy of RJ Davis, who scored 22 points.

The Spartans' victory bumped their record up to 20-14. As for the Tar Heels, they are on a roll lately: they've won nine of their last ten games, which provided a nice bump to their 28-7 record this season.

Michigan State strolled past N. Carolina in their previous meeting back in November of 2017 by a score of 63-45. Will Michigan State repeat their success, or does N. Carolina have a better game plan this time around? We'll find out soon enough.

Series History

Michigan State won the only game these two teams have played in the last 7 years.

Tax-Saving Investments

If you wait to make tax-saving investments, you won't be able to fully profit from them.

Unaware Of Tax Exemption

The majority of people aren't even aware that their payments for many expenses are allowable deductions from taxes. They so fail to disclose these costs and wind up having to pay additional taxes.

Tax-Inefficient

You must pay taxes on interest earned on both Fds and NSCs. These products are therefore tax-inefficient.

Investment In Endowment Plans

Endowment plans by themselves won't yield very high returns if you invest a sizable portion of your hard-earned money in them.

Not Utilise Section 80

A woman indicted for her role in a scheme to file false tax returns and then use Hawaii businesses, banks and trusts to launder the refunds entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and pleaded guilty Wednesday.

Sook Young Jung, a former Honolulu resident, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by fraudulently obtaining a tax refund and then thwarting efforts to recoup it, according to a Justice Department news release from Washington, D.C.

Jung was the sixth person charged in connection with the investigation. The case was one of at least three tax-fraud indictments in 2021 that listed ""co-conspirator 1"" as the owner of the Gimmel Group LLC, a domestic limited-liability company in Hawaii that ""purported to be a personal investment business,"" according to the 15-count indictment handed down July 15, 2021, and unsealed Sept. 9, 2021.

Jung conspired ""with others to file a false 2015 individual income tax return in her name.""

Jung's co-conspirators created a fake tax form purportedly issued by a mortgage lender to Jung, which Jung attached to her return, that ""falsely reported that Jung withheld over $1.7 million in taxes."" As a result of this ""fraudulent submission,"" the IRS issued Jung a refund of $1,147,036.

Jung allegedly conspired with the Gimmel Group's owner and a signatory of Mortgage Compliance Advisors &Solutions LLC, a Florida company, by recruiting at least five other people to file false tax returns to obtain refunds they did not deserve.

The five are listed only by their initials in the indictment: C.H., B.K.K., C.S.W., S.S.L. and J.H.

From 2015 to 2019, Jung, an accomplice and the owner of Gimmel Group allegedly used MCA&S to act as their recruits' mortgage lender to help fill out IRS Form 1099-MISC and Form 1040 to claim fake, sizable tax withholdings.

The conspirators allegedly filed a false 2014 amended individual income tax return that claimed a refund of $464,904 and a false 2015 individual income tax return that claimed a refund of $1,134,902, according to DOJ.

Jung and others paid the owner of the Gimmel Group ""substantial fees"" based in part on a percentage of tax refunds received and the amount of work done to facilitate false returns, according to the indictment. The pair created fake trusts and opened bank accounts in the name of the trusts to conceal the proceeds and prevent the IRS from recovering the money.

Jung and an accomplice also cut cashier's checks from the accounts to pay alleged co-conspirators, according to federal court documents.

After filing the false tax return and submitting the fake tax form, Jung took ""steps to try and ensure that the IRS could not recover the fraudulently obtained refund,"" according to the Justice Department.

On one occasion, Jung deposited the refund check into a newly opened bank account and immediately withdrew most of the funds in cashier's checks. She also paid, through nominees, one of her co- conspirators ""$500,000 for the co- conspirator's assistance in obtaining the fraudulent refund.""

Jung is scheduled to be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, a period of supervised release, restitution and a fine.

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department's Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Clare E. Connors for the District of Hawaii made the announcement.

The prosecution was the result of an ongoing investigation by the IRS Criminal Investigation, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

However the interest is reinvested for the initial 4 years and therefore will not be chargeable to Income Tax and this reinvestment will be allowed as deduction u/s 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Since the maturity period of NSC is five years, the interest can be re-invested only for four years.

The Board of Education will hold a 6:30 p.m. public hearing Monday for the maximum property tax levy at the Education Service Center, 1516 Washington St.

The state changed the process for taxing entities' budget hearings so now they must have two opportunities for public comment on proposed taxes. The public hearing must be a separate from a regular meeting. It will take place after Monday's regular school board meeting.

The district's maximum property tax askings could be $39.4 million - $2.6 million, or 6.9%, more than the current year. This is the most the district can ask for. The published amount can only remain the same or decrease.

The district's current property tax rate of $13.36 per $1,000 of taxable value could grow to $13.98, a 62 cent increase.

However, individual residential and commercial property owners could see a decrease in the school district portion of their tax bills for the fiscal year starting July 1. Due to recent changes in the state rollback (which determines the percentage of property value to be taxed), owners of property with an assessed value of $100,000 would pay $648 annually under the proposal. That's $82, or 11.2%, less than last year.

A final decision will be made on the property tax rate following the hearing at a later date.

Prior to the proposed budget hearing, during the regular meeting at 5 p.m., the school board could approve a purchase of more than $1 million for new student and teacher Chromebooks as well as carrying cases. This includes 3,585 computers and 2,445 cases.

The laptops would go to all sixth and ninth graders along with students at Poyner and Orange elementary schools because their computers are at the end of their life span.

THOUSANDS of households face paying more for council tax within weeks, despite the nationwide freeze.

Rebel councils Argyll and Bute and Inverclyde rejected the Scottish Governments bid to freeze council tax.

Inverclyde agreed to increase local tax by 8.2% this year while Argyll and Bute opted for a 10% rise.

The Scottish Sun's pulled all the data together to reveal the highest council tax area to the lowest in Scotland.

Argyll and Bute's top tier tax band - letter H - has become the most expensive in the country at £3986.45.

While Western Isles Council has the cheapest Band H council tax with £3162.34 beating South Lanarkshire Council by nearly £25.

However, the cheapest council tax area to live in is Clackmannanshire Council at £783.87.

Argyll and Bute also became the most expensive band A tax band in Scotland with £1084.74 this year.

The most expensive place to live for people in the Band D band is Argyll and Bute Council at £1627.12.

It is also now the most expensive place to live for council tax in Scotland.

Shetland Islands Council has the cheapest band D council tax rate at £1260.61.

The majority of councils decided keep their rates from last year after the Scottish Government handed them £147 million in funding including a £62.7 million injection for town halls.

It comes a year after some local authorities across the country were annoyed by the shock announcement.

Legislature increased the state sales tax by a penny on the dollar in order to cut homeowner property taxes in half, and it put strict limits on how fast taxes could rise. The result was that although landlords and other commercial businesses and some home-grown industries pay pretty high property taxes, homeowners do not.

The property taxes that were reduced -- eliminated actually -- were school operating taxes paid on owner-occupied homes. And the other result of what came to be known as Act 388 was that funding for S.C. schools quickly started to fall behind, because the nation plunged into a deep recession, sales tax revenue didn't rise as fast as property tax revenue, and although the Legislature obeyed the part of its law that required it to send money to the schools equal to the amount of property taxes they were no longer allowed to collect, it never increased that funding as much as schools and counties would have increased property taxes. More significantly, lawmakers slowed the increase in other school funding, despite state laws that required them to spend more.

In recent years, lawmakers have done a much better job of increasing school funding to keep up with inflation, the growing student population and the additional duties they place on our schools, but the funding has never gotten back to the level state law has required since before Act 388 was passed. It's not easy to calculate exactly how much school funding continues to suffer, but we know because of an unrelated law that funding for public schools and higher education was 57% of the entire budget in 2006, and by 2018 it had dropped to 52%. We know too that education has received less than 52% of new revenue each year since then.

It's against this backdrop that the Legislature considers what to do with a $600 million surplus that has built up in what's called the Homestead Exemption Fund, largely as a result of all the extra sales tax revenue the state has collected since the pandemic skewed our spending back toward taxable goods.

Gov. Henry McMaster proposed spending $500 million of that surplus on highway construction. The House wisely rejected that idea, but the budget bill it passed last week sends the money to homeowners for a one-time tax cut that the South Carolina Daily Gazette reports will average $359 per home.

House leaders point to a provision in the 2006 law that says any excess in the Homestead Exemption Fund is to be used for tax cuts. They seem to forget that state law also requires them to spend at least 57% of the state budget on public and higher education, and yet they add a proviso to the budget every year that says they can ignore that law. They could easily do the same for the tax cut provision -- and they should.

South Carolina's overall tax burden has never been high relative to other states. And it's worth noting that more than $1.4 billion in the $13.2 billion budget is actually what the Ways and Means Committee briefing calls ""direct tax relief,"" and that the Legislature has delivered more than $50 billion in tax cuts over the past 30 years. More tax cuts are not our state's highest need; not even close. And even if more tax cuts were needed, how fair would it be to use the sales tax, paid by everyone in the state, to cut taxes for the minority of South Carolinians who own their own homes?

The fact is that for the first 13 years after the tax swap was implemented, the Legislature had to use general revenue to reimburse school districts for the property taxes they weren't allowed to collect, because that penny tax wasn't generating enough money. It would make more sense to use that $600 million in surplus to pay back the general fund than distributing it as tax rebates.

More specifically, since the Legislature is still underfunding schools according to that 57% law it hasn't obeyed in years, the money should go back into our schools. No, it can't pay for bigger raises for teachers -- which the House did a very nice job of providing -- because it's one-time money that won't be available to maintain those raises the following year. Nor can it go to hire more teachers or support staff, for the same reasons.

But it can pay for a lot of smart ideas in Education Superintendent Ellen Weaver's budget proposal, from the additional $116 million for instructional materials the House didn't fund to a larger career ladder pilot program than the $5 million in the budget to a transformational proposal she and her predecessor have supported to create a school facility infrastructure bank that rural schools could draw from for upgrades or even new buildings they can't afford with their shrinking tax bases.

Any of those would be smarter uses of money paid by everybody in the state than another tax rebate to benefit a small portion of the population. And the infrastructure bank would be transformational for students in our most struggling schools.

Tel Aviv [Israel], March 23 (ANI/TPS): Israel's the Government Authority for Water and Sewerage, in collaboration with other relevant government ministries, has been working for the past two years on preparing a long-term plan for the treatment of wastewater, led by a steering team, consisting of professionals from various fields. Water management is crucial for Israel considering the expanding population in Israel which is expected to hit 16 million by 20250. The work of the team was conducted on the basis of the vision of the sewage system, which guarantees the provision of sewage services of adequate quality, quantity and reliability and with economic efficiency, for the development of the country and the realization of its various national goals, so that all the effluents will be put to various uses without usage restrictions, mainly for agriculture, while preserving the environment and natural water sources and without discharge in the streams.

One of the foundations of sustainable management of the water sector is long-term planning and the weighing of the various aspects in the required balance of decisions. The population of the State of Israel is growing at a rate of 1.8 percent per year.

In light of this, along with the development of desalinated water production and transmission infrastructures, there is a need to carry out a significant development of wastewater treatment facilities as well as prepare a national vision for the transfer of large amounts of effluents between regions, for the benefit of agricultural use. Along with planning, one must also prepare for investments in the scope of billions of shekels in the development of the sewage system. (ANI/TPS)

The political figures receiving the most attention out of 17 presidential hopefuls during this electoral cycle - candidates Amadou Ba, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Mame Boye Diao, and former favourite for office, Ousmane Sonko - are all current or former tax inspectors.

For many, it is a simple coincidence, their earlier professions having no bearing on their selection for candidacy. But for others, their perceived wealth and financial savvy make a difference.

To participate in the presidential election, you need the financial means to do it, explained Alioune Tine, a prominent Senegalese political analyst, highlighting that the four figures are the most apt among public administration to participate in the presidential elections thanks to their wealth.

""Financial power looks for political power,"" said Tine. ""They are often richer than people in the private sector.""

For some voters, the candidates' background is important as it inspires trust and competency.

Ousmane Guisse, a 37-year-old insurance broker and Ministry of Commerce employee, is planning on voting for Ba, a former prime minister, due to the fact that he proved himself by climbing up the ladder of meritocracy.

""Mr Ba isn't just a simple inspector like Faye, Sonko or Diao,"" said Guisse. ""He's a former director general who has worked his way up to the top.""

Ba was once the director of the Directorate General of Taxes and Estates and was the minister of economy under two governments. Now, he is the presidential candidate of outgoing President Macky Sall's party, the Alliance of the Republic.

Diao - who belongs to the same party as Ba and incumbent Sall - was the director of the Deposit and Consignment Fund in Senegal and most recently mayor of Kolda, a city in the south of the country, since January 2022.

He has decided to not back Ba, the party's favourite, in this election and run his own campaign instead under a different party called the Coalition for a New Senegal.

Meanwhile, Sonko, a controversial but also venerated opposition figure, was barred from running in the elections after facing sexual assault and libel charges. Former mayor of the southern Senegalese city of Ziguinchor and a former tax inspector who investigated the government's gas and oil deals with foreign companies, he rose to prominence as the leader of the Pastef party. The coalition was dissolved in 2023 after Sonko was arrested and accused of inciting riots around the country.

Sonko, together with Faye - also a tax inspector and a favourite in the elections - now lead the opposition party formed out of the syndicate of tax and estate agents they led.

The four men are all vouching to change the country and fight for the people. Either part of the establishment or challenging it, the current or former tax inspectors seem to have coalesced the trust of the people, whether independent of their background or not.

Guillaume Soto-Mayor, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that the reputation of tax inspectors can be beneficial but also harmful.

Sonko and Faye are seen as embodying another vision of the tax inspector, one that serves the law and its applications for anyone, no matter their wealth, origins or family ties. Meanwhile, Ba is seen as part of the old guard, reinforcing the same alliances and interests that have dominated Senegal for the past two administrations.

""[Faye and Sonko] incarnate a counter-image of the traditional corrupted, nepotic and kleptocratic administrative figures,"" said Soto-Mayor.

On the other hand, explains the scholar, tax collectors are also disliked by some factions of society as the most hated administrative figures as they impede citizens from having thriving businesses and accumulating personal wealth.

Being a tax inspector is seen as ""the quickest way to become a millionaire"", according to Soto-Mayor, who believes Senegalese citizens see it as a corrupt position.

Pathe Thiam, a 22-year-old Senegalese student, told Al Jazeera that for him, tax inspectors represent a ""certain elitism that is rife in the country because these inspectors were trained in the most prestigious schools and are often colleagues, friends and relatives"".

For Thiam, this raises questions about corruption, because all of the inspectors among the candidates, with the exception of Faye, refuse to make their asset declaration and explain the origin of their campaign funds.

""They have politicised their function, thus forgetting their duty to the republic,"" said Thiam.

For other voters, like Vieux Aidara Moncap, a France-based activist for Sonko and Faye's coalition party Pastef, the role of tax inspector has ""absolutely nothing to do with"" why certain figures have been selected to represent political parties.

Rather their policies and positions as leaders of the parties, thinks Moncap, are more relevant factors as to why they have been chosen.",aljazeera.com,news,Al Jazeera Online,Andrei Popoviciu,0.3568627450980393,448883424,1,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-22-at-2.34.25-PM-1-1711107652.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,eng-9417695

The special procedures have been recommended for small traders and shopkeepers in the SRO issued by the FBR.

Under th scheme, every retailer and shopkeeper will have to apply for registration under Ordinance 181, and this can be done through the Tax App by April 30th.

A minimum monthly advance tax will be applicable to every individual based on their income.

If the annual advance tax is zero, such individuals will have to pay an annual fee of Rs. 1200.

However, if someone is exempt from income tax for any reason, this will not apply to them. If someone pays their advance tax in full or balances it, their overall advance tax will be reduced by 25 percent. It should be noted that the FBR finalized the Merchant Friendly Scheme two months ago to bring traders into the tax net.

The FBR developed the 'Merchant Friend' mobile app for the purpose of implementing the scheme and registering traders.

The traders outside the tax net will be registered through the Merchant Friend app.

The FBR would receive records of shopkeepers' income through this app.

The shopkeepers would be taxed annually based on their income, collected monthly. The tax will be imposed on the size of the shop and annual income, collected on a monthly basis.

Residents in Bath and North East Somerset are being notified of new limits on how much domestic DIY waste they can recycle at once and how often, due to a change in government legislation.

Recycling of domestic DIY waste will continue to be free of charge at Bath & North East Somerset Council's recycling centres, however no more than the equivalent of two 50-litre bags of plasterboard, rubble, soil and ceramics is allowed to be disposed of in a single visit.

The number of visits is also limited to four single visits per household in any four-week period.

The council introduced the changes from March 4.

Currently, the council permits a maximum of six black sacks per week of this type of DIY waste to be disposed of free of charge, which does not comply with the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) legislation published in December 2023.

This legislation was updated by DEFRA to ensure that waste regulations are applied fairly and that residents can continue to dispose of small-scale DIY waste from their own home improvement works for free.

DIY waste is considered to be plasterboard, rubble, ceramics and soil from construction or demolition works, including preparatory works at home, arising from work carried out by ordinary householders with no specialist skills. This differs from waste created by builders working on people's homes, which is classed as commercial waste and should not be brought to the recycling centres.

Councillor Tim Ball, cabinet member for neighbourhood services at the council, has approved the changes in a single member decision. The single member decision report can be found here

Councillor Ball said: ""Disposal of DIY waste from residents at our recycling centres has always been and will continue to be free, but the new legislation more clearly sets out the limits on the volume brought in any one visit and also the frequency of the visits.

""This will not restrict householders in carrying out small-scale renovations and improvements to your homes as you will still be able to bring your DIY waste to us without charge. However, the waste must meet the government criteria for domestic waste which is two 50-litre bags per visit and a maximum of four visits per household in any four-week period. Our recycling centre staff will be on hand to assist you with the changes when you visit.""

Residents who have waste in excess of the limits are encouraged to hire a skip or use a licenced waste removal company.

Easily File Your Income Tax Return: You don't have to worry if your PAN is inactive if you miss linking it with your Aadhaar by June 2023. The income tax department had previously clarified that an inoperative PAN remains active. Individuals who do not require an audit for the Financial Year 2023-24 (Assessment Year 2024-25) must file their Income Tax Returns by July 31, 2024.

Tax2win co-founder and CEO Abhishek Soni explains that you can still file your income tax return if you fail to link your PAN with your UID by June 2023.

In contrast, Soni clarifies that the verification process will not involve Aadhaar OTP. Instead, you can generate an Electronic Verification Code (EVC) through net banking, ATMs, or other approved methods.

If the PAN is not linked to the taxpayer's Aadhaar number, it is considered inoperative.

The Income Tax Return (ITR) can be filed even if the PAN becomes inoperative, said Vijay Bharech, Director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP.

The process of filing income tax returns remains the same even if your PAN is inactive.

""You can simply log in to your account on the income tax e-filing portal and follow the steps outlined for filing income tax returns. This typically involves navigating to the e-file section, selecting the option for income tax return filing, and proceeding with the necessary details and documentation,"" explained Abhishek Soni.

The inactive PAN, however, will result in repercussions. If you file an Income Tax Return (ITR) with an inactive PAN, you won't be allowed to claim a refund or interest on refunds. Aadhaar linking is mandatory for refund claims.

Vijay Bharech stated that refunds, if any, will not be given to taxpayers, and interest will only be paid once the PAN is activated.

In the event that you did not file your original income tax return (ITR), you still have the option to file an updated return by March 31, 2024. Taxpayers can file updated returns for the assessment years 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24.

The European Union exerts considerable sway over digital gambling guidelines spanning its 27 member states. The central iGaming black market problem lies in the impact of rigorous regulations on Europe's iGaming sphere. Recent data sheds light on the proactive steps taken by various European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands in combatting illegal betting and the proliferation of the black market. As the CEO of OC24.LTD, I, Micha? Kurzanowski, provide crucial observations into illegal and legal online gambling. This article examines the pressing matter of tackling black market gaming in Europe.

Growing Demand for Online Casinos Among Europeans

I'd like to share insights into the industry of sports betting and gambling in Europe. The European gambling sector shows a promising rise thanks to new trends like expanding smartphone use and universal digital access, which make betting more accessible.

Despite the hurdles, the online casino Europe market's forecast looks favorable, adapting to changing wants and industry developments.

Notably, the popularity of digital gambling in the UK has witnessed a surge, driven by factors such as global digitalization, technological advancements, increased recognition, and effective marketing strategies.

What Is the Current Situation with Gambling Regulation in Europe?

Nations like Germany and the UK have intensified advertising restrictions on online betting. Gambling rules include betting amounts, self-exclusion, stringent verification, limited payment methods, and game bans.

Next, let us describe a little more about the issues faced by each country:

In short, tougher European betting constraints are causing problems. As a result, players increasingly turn to brands licensed in places like Curacao, which have fewer rules, more games and bonuses, and enticing features. The gray market offers greater functionality and more games than the government-restricted market. The white market loses users and income, resulting in hundreds of millions of untaxed revenues.

Conclusion: More Flexible Regulations and Restrictions Will Positively Impact the Development of Legal Gambling

As the Chief Executive Officer of OC24.LTD, I firmly believe that the implementation of more flexible regulations and the relaxation of existing restrictions will lead to positive outcomes. Excessive regulation drives players towards more enticing illicit offers, particularly impacting vulnerable groups. The existing approach is ineffective, necessitating a shift to streamlined licensing and industry collaboration. Loosening regulations will enable better oversight, foster market growth, and safeguard players and businesses. Therefore, OC24.LTD advocates regulation and legalization across Europe, seeking a transparent licensing process that considers all perspectives.",news.cision.com,news,News Powered by Cision,,-0.003921568627450966,448882163,1,https://mb.cision.com/Public/21505/3951116/90558831d744f010_400x400ar.jpg,

Collections from the 5.5% per-night tax on hotel stays and homeshare rentals brought in $21,555,345 in 2023, up from $14,088,391 the previous year, when it was 3%.

The Suffolk County Legislature approved raising the tax last April, largely to increase the amount of money given to a regional tourism agency and to provide a stable revenue source for a planned convention center that would be Long Island's first. The tax increase, signed by former County Executive Steve Bellone, went into effect in June and is levied in addition to Suffolk's 8.623% sales tax.

The Montauk ZIP code brought in the most hotel-motel tax revenue: $4,653,241 in 2023, up from $3,503,701 the previous year.

While most of the revenue comes from the East End, where the highest-priced hotels are located, other top ZIP codes include Melville with $1,177,323, up from $859,241 in 2022, and Hauppague, with $1,047,835, up from $642,184.

Here's how the additional funds will be used:

The county has raised the amount of annual funds it provides to the tourism promotion group Discover Long Island from $2 million to $6 million. The additional funds allowed the organization, whose entire annual revenue was $3.5 million in 2022, to expand its marketing and hire more support staff, according to executive director Kristen Reynolds.

""We have been grossly underfunded for decades,"" Reynolds said. ""And so we have a lot of catching up to do.""

The organization plans to add marketing in cities like Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Boston and potentially in ""long-haul"" markets like Atlanta.

""The goal is always to have the visitors that are going to stay longer and spend more money as opposed to day-trippers and people that come and have more of a burden on your infrastructure or your quality of life,"" she said.

Of the revenue collected, $17,250,000 is committed to various agencies and regions, including the $6 million to Discover Long Island, $3.25 million to Suffolk parks and $1.25 million to the Vanderbilt Museum, Mansion and Planetarium in Centerport. The remaining money is allotted for the recently created Suffolk County Infrastructure Fund, which will be used to build a convention center in Ronkonkoma, part of a $2.8 billion redevelopment project known as Midway Crossing.

""It is a way for Long Island to get into the association and convention business, which we've never been able to before,"" said Mitch Pally, chairman of the Midway Crossing project's nonprofit local development corporation board and a Discover Long Island board member, ""while other much smaller communities like Syracuse and Albany and Hartford and Buffalo have convention centers and attract a sizable amount of business.""

The convention center is expected to cost about $300 million, and the tax revenue will fund construction bond payments, Pally said. Officials are hoping construction will begin in 2025, he said.

A December study from global consulting firm HVS, commissioned by the county and Discover Long Island, estimates the convention center could generate $88.6 million in annual economic impact.

Heywood Sanders, a professor in the public administration department at the University of Texas at San Antonio who has studied convention centers for 25 years, said consultants often overestimate their economic benefit. He noted the HVS study estimated that 150,000 of the 259,000 annual attendees would be for consumer shows, which often do not attract out-of-town visitors.

""It doesn't necessarily play out the way folks say it will,"" Sanders said. ""It is not uncommon for convention centers to do, in terms of hotel room nights or convention attendance, less than half of the business that consultants forecast.""

Suffolk last year began contracting with international government software provider Granicus to find people who rent homes on Airbnb and other websites and notify them of the tax, which also applies to vacation home rentals. The software uses AI technology and employees to determine which properties are available for rent and notifies the property owner that they must pay the tax.

As a result, Suffolk County Comptroller John Kennedy said the number of owners paying the tax has increased from 2,400 to about 3,400.

Kennedy, who said his office does not have the staff to find vacation home rentals and enforce payment of the tax, said there may be solutions that cost less than Granicus' $269,000 annual fee for the service.

Granicus representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",newsday.com,news,Newsday,,0.2784313725490195,448881803,1,https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZGM2YjQ4MDYtNjkwMy00:YTQyY2Zl/landscape/1280,

They're sometimes confusing, often complex, and, depending on your worldview, necessary.

For context, if you're not sure what a mill levy is, it's the tax rate that is applied to the assessed value of a property. One mill is one dollar per $1,000 of assessed value.

The Topeka Capital-Journal's Jason Alatidd reports Kansas Republicans are advancing plans to abolish an unfunded program intended to help local governments provide property tax relief. Instead of putting money into the local ad valorem tax reduction fund for the first time in two decades, Republican lawmakers would formally end the program and put money toward cutting state property taxes.

Republicans, Alatidd reports, say abolishing the fund called LAVTRF would essentially provide the same amount of tax relief as cutting state mill levies. Kansas stopped funding the LAVTRF in 2004 because the state was in a budget crunch.

Alatidd reports Senate Bill 94 would eliminate the 1.5 mills combined for state building construction and maintenance. Additionally, House Bill 2815 would cut the 20 mills to 18 mills, then further cut it in the future as valuations rise in order to raise the same dollar amount of revenue.

But it's a bit more complicated than that.

It's disappointing the Legislature has ignored its funding mandate in recent decades. How loud do state legislators yell when federal funding mandates go unfulfilled?

Taking away this fund also provides no protection of funding to local governments that depend on them. If the state gets into another budget crisis, there's no guarantee local communities would get relief.

The Senate Republican plan to cut 1.5 mills would be about $35 in tax cuts on a $200,000 home. What a relief. That's practically two fast food combo meals. Its implications would impact government buildings, schools and other infrastructure. We can't overlook that.

A host of local government representatives lined up to oppose the House bill, ranging from counties to municipalities to school boards.

We need legislators to listen to their concerns and give them some consideration.

Perhaps the decision on the best way to address local property taxes should be made by local voices.

This seems like another time when the state decides it knows best -- and we know how much they hate it when federal leaders do that to them.",eu.cjonline.com,news,Tribune,Topeka Capital-Journal,0.1764705882352942,448881418,1,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/12/NSHT/72577791007-glinktaxes-20240215.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2108,1186,x0,y213&format=pjpg&width=1200",

The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) has voted to keep interest rates at 5.25% in an attempt to curb inflation; the squeeze on homeowners, borrowers and renters continues. The thinking is that if we all just hunker down and get through this period of pain, the bank will meet its 2% inflation target and we'll all start to feel better off.

Except, for some of us, this isn't our experience at all. For millionaires like me, who own our homes outright, the decisions of the MPC make virtually no difference to our outgoings. Free from the shackles of high borrowing rates, we're able to spend to our hearts' content. In fact, for those with cash in the bank, higher interest rates actively boost income and spending power. There is cash to be spent on original artworks to decorate their several homes; and travel between residences, adding to both the climate and housing crises.

It is this unshackled spending of the very wealthiest that is keeping rates for everyone else so high. And don't just take my word for it - take MPC member Catherine Mann's comments. As long as the richest have so much spare cash, everyone else will have to feel the squeeze in a ""collective"" effort to bring down inflation. In the meantime, high rates mean the wealthiest see a nice boost to their savings - the top 10% are expected to receive 65% of the £90bn in household savings in 2024-2025.

How can it be that in the middle of an unprecedented fall in living standards, the people who can least afford to pay for the inflation crisis are being told it is their spending that needs to be curbed? Not only is this counterintuitive (how can you curb the demand of families who already have so little disposable income?) - it is completely unfair.

Instead, as the campaign group Stop the Squeeze has argued, we need a response to the cost of living crisis that tackles the structural inequalities that got us into this mess, not one that entrenches them.

Let's start with our broken tax system. We continue to hear about how high our taxes are, but the truth is that while our system disproportionately taxes the vast majority who get their income from work, those who are already wealthy from investments, rent and inheritances are taxed relatively lightly. Our own prime minister, who earned more than £2m last year and is married to a billionaire, pays the same effective tax rate as a teacher.

The good news is, there are plenty of ways to address this imbalance. Equalising rates of capital gains tax with income tax, so that income from wealth is taxed at the same level as income from work, would raise £16.7bn a year. Removing loopholes and reliefs from inheritance tax would raise around £1bn a year. Applying national insurance more consistently across all forms of income could raise over £30bn a year. And an annual tax on stocks of wealth would raise nearly £12bn a year. Together, a package of higher taxes on wealth could raise billions to fund cost of living support in the short term and provide essential public goods such as a strong social safety net and clean, affordable energy provision in the future.

As a member of the campaign group Patriotic Millionaires UK, I want rich people like me to pay our fair share of tax. And I'm not alone. Nearly 75% of millionaires also want higher taxes on wealth.

The Bank of England is right to want to curb inflation. But the idea of squeezing low- and middle-income earners so that millionaires can keep spending on luxury items isn't the way forward.

In Government's continuing efforts to make the implementation of property tax more acceptable to the population, Al-Rawi said property taxes would give the Government greater flexibility to spend more on healthcare delivery.

He was speaking on a private motion filed by Caroni East MP Dr Rishad Seecheran, calling on the Government to improve the delivery of healthcare services and address mismanagement in the health sector.

During the debate Al-Rawi became emotional and had to fight back tears as he recalled visiting former independent senator Baptiste-­McKnight, who died from cancer, in her final days at the St James Medical Complex.

Al-Rawi said the Opposition's motion asked for more money to be given to the health sector.

""Yes, more, but from where?"" he asked.

He said when the Government says to have the Revenue Authority to improve the revenue collection or there needs to be property taxes to run local government and leave central government with more money for the health system, the Opposition says no.

""The only way the Government runs itself is via that ugly word 'tax'. ""The Opposition says give us more, but (the Opposition also) says we are not giving you the ability to get more, the Opposition says no to (increasing) borrowing limits,"" he said.

Naparima MP Rodney Charles shouted that that mo­ney was going ""to pay rent"".

Al-Rawi rejoined: ""Hear the foolishness coming from Naparima -- 'to pay rent'. (He is) Fixated in his retirement. Coming from the members opposite is a level of vile contribution that is personal and puerile and obnoxious, that in the middle of a serious contribution about sour­cing financing for the regional health authorities...that Naparima (MP)...a self-professed elder amongst us...could engage in absolute nonsense.

""You (the Opposition) bring a motion (to say) you want more (money for the health sector), (but) you say no to all of the remedies. It's like somebody saying, 'I am hungry but I want nothing you have to offer',"" Al-Rawi said.

No shortage

Al-Rawi turned to the ""hot item"" in the news -- the ""very bold statement"" of Dr Asante Le Blanc to a joint select committee that oncology drugs were not available or that outdated drugs were being used.

Al-Rawi said it caused a headline: ""Cancer care gone through in Trinidad"".

He noted the NWRHA (North West Regional Health Authority) and some of the most respected players in the field of oncology cancer treatment came out ""aggressively"" to say no.

As he spoke about Dr Le Blanc, Health Minister Terrence Deyal­singh interjected: ""She is an excellent GP.""

Saying that cancer care was free, including diagnostic and palliative care, Al-Rawi, in a voice thick with emotion, said: ""I remember (former) independent senator Corrine Baptiste-McKnight, herself a cancer treatment patient, got to the point of not being able to survive, had to go into palliative care, right there at St James.

""Every time I recall visiting her, I recall her lying down in her bed, I recall her laughing (and saying), 'Faris, I have a yellow blanket on me, don't read into it', but I recall her saying, 'God bless the people that treat me here for free as I live out my dying days in Trinidad and Tobago'. Sorry to be a little emotional,"" he said, adding: ""She was a good soul, really good soul.""

Coming back to Le Blanc's statement, Al-Rawi said there was no shortage of chemotherapy infusion pharmaceuticals in the country, including those used for breast and prostate cancer.

He said while chemo drugs were short in other countries, T&T was not experiencing any difficulties.

He added that none of the drugs being used were obsolete.

Millions benefit from

T&T health care

Al-Rawi said statistics relative to the NCRHA (North Central Regional Health Authority), which compri­ses eight health entities, showed that in 2021, in the Accident and Emergency department alone, there were 153,860 patients; in 2022, there were 183,308; in 2023 -- 204,155, ""33% more patients seen in 2023 than were seen in 2021"".

Al-Rawi said in the general practice clinic, in 2021 -- 93,000; in 2022 -- 98,000 and 2023 -- 116,000-odd patients were seen.

Maternal and child health appearances -- 89,000 in 2023; in 2022 -- 80,000; in 2021 -- 90,000.

He said in the chronic disease clinics, there were 61,000 people in 2021; 60,000 in 2022; and 59,000 in 2023. In radiology procedures, there were 215,000 people in 2021; 223,000 in 2022; and 253,000 in 2023.

""Laboratory diagnostics: 2021 -- 2,457,000 in 2021; 2.7 million diagnostics conducted free in 2022; and 2.575 million in 2023.

""For free!"" he said.

In terms of surgical procedures, in 2023 -- 12,700 procedures were done; 9,134 in 2022; and 9,192 in 2021. He said there were also 166,000 outpatients in 2023; and 112,000 in 2022.

Al-Rawi said T&T was the only country where doctors had the ""pri­vilege of being able to practice in the public hos­pital and in private practice.

""Nowhere else in the world does that happen, for conflict of interest reasons,"" said Al-Rawi, who said his son is a medical intern.

Al-Rawi said the Member for Diego Martin Central Symon De Nobriga told him about a constituent whose child broke his arm while playing football.

He was taken to a well-known private facility in the West and was told it would cost $65,000 to treat the child.

The man went to the Mt Hope hospital and the surgery was done, the bed given, medication was provi­ded and aftercare given, all at no cost.

The outlook of the industry, however, remains bleak due to the uncertainty created by the proposed 2023 Alcoholic Drinks Control Bill currently before Parliament. The Bill seeks to limit time for drinking beer in bars, the biggest sale points for Uganda's alcoholic drinks, meaning the industry will be plunged into a sharp fall in sales revenue.

The brewers state that they have previously relied on sales revenue to justify their decision to maintain low prices. While appearing before the House Committee on Health and Trade, currently scrutinising the Bill, the leadership of Private Sector Foundation of Uganda (PSFU) -- a private businesses advocacy body -- instead asked Parliament to regulate the illicit brews in the country.

According to Dr Julius Byaruhanga, the PSFU director of policy and business development, the Bill does not apply to the sale of native alcohol which presents a risk of increased illicit trade that is already about 65 percent.

The private sector has taken exception to Section 14 of the Bill, which says: ""A licensee shall not sell an alcoholic drink or native liquor before 17:00 hours and after 22:00 hours on working days, and 12:00 hours and after 00:00 hours on public holidays and weekends.""",monitor.co.ug,news,Daily Monitor,,0.003921568627450966,448880516,1,https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/blob/4565962/0e93f25d75fa987ae12662fc1ad1b538/home01pix-data.jpg,

Here are income tax compliance you should know before you purchase,"The provision of Section 194IA requires a buyer of immovable property, other than agricultural land, to deduct tax at source @ 1% of the sale consideration if the sale consideration exceeds fifty lakh rupees. This provision applies only when you are buying a property from a resident.

Provision of Section 195 of the Income Tax Act will apply when the seller is a non-resident.

Under Section 195 any person who pays any sum of money to a non-resident and who is taxable in India has to deduct tax on the income portion of the payment being made to the non-resident. For the purchase of property from a resident you have to deduct tax at 1% on the sale consideration of the property only if the consideration for the purchase of the property exceeds 50 lakhs but in respect of property being bought from a non-resident no such threshold limit is prescribed and the buyer has to deduct tax irrespective of the value of the property as long as the seller is making profit on the sale.

Moreover, in case of the purchase of property from a non-resident, the buyer is required to deduct tax at source on the amount of taxable capital gains but for property purchase from a resident tax @ 1% is required to be deducted as a whole of the sale consideration. In case the capital gains are long-term in nature, you have to deduct tax on the income component of the sale consideration at 20% but if the capital gains are short-term in nature, the applicable rate is 30% tax of the short-term capital gains.

As far as a procedure to be following in your case is concerned, you have to obtain a tax deduction account number (TAN), even if this is the only transaction, for depositing the tax deducted from payment made to a non-resident, to the credit of the government, whereas in case of purchase of property from a resident seller, you do not have to obtain any TAN number, you just need PAN number of the seller and the buyer.

The form no. 26QB is treated as challan cum return in case the seller is a resident and no separate TDS return is required to be filed. For buying property from a non-resident even though it is a single transaction you have to obtain a TAN and file a TDS return. I would advise you to seek the help of a Chartered Accountant to comply with the law properly.

Dr. Bawumia during a meeting with the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, voiced concerns about the alleged use of tax collection by GRA staff as a pretext for harassing businesses.

In response to this, the Organized Labour in a statement dated Friday, March 22, 2024, described Dr Bawumia's comments as ""unfortunate"", viewing them as a slight against the diligent efforts of GRA employees.

""We would like to state unequivocally that, we the workers of GRA find this statement unfortunate and consider it as an attack on the efforts of the hard-working staff of the Authority which if not discontinued, would incur the displeasure of workers, disrupt revenue collection efforts and breed industrial disharmony.""

They warned that such statements could lead to worker discontent, hinder revenue collection, and cause industrial unrest.

The group further urged the Vice President to either acknowledge the significant advancements made by GRA or refrain from making remarks that undermine their work.

They highlighted the contradiction in Dr Bawumia's stance, given his role as Head of the Economic Management Team and his awareness of the government-set targets for the Authority through the Ministry of Finance.

""It is strange that the Vice President, who also doubles as the Head of the Economic Management Team could suggest that the Authority gives itself unrealistic targets while he is well aware that annual targets are assigned to the Authority by the government through the Ministry of Finance.

""Indeed, the least we expect from the Vice President, if he would not appreciate the efforts of the Authority in raising Tax Revenue, is not to put the lives of our hardworking staff at risk with such unfortunate comments.""

Organized Labour emphasized the potential negative impact of the Vice President's statements on future revenue mobilization and appealed to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to address the issue with his Vice.

""We also call on the President of the Republic of Ghana, H.E. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the GRA Board, Civil Society organizations and all well-meaning Ghanaians to admonish political functionaries to desist from making such pronouncements and intervene swiftly as this statement poses a major risk to revenue mobilization efforts going forward.""

The 60km road would be excised from the N896b 284km stretch of the road awarded in 2012 to four contractors.

According to the Minister to the Minister of Works, Senator David Umahi, the new arrangement became necessary because of the N897b road project, where N122b was available from the Tax Credit Scheme leaving a shortfall of N775b.

Umahi spoke on Thursday evening in Abuja when the Edo State Senate caucus leaders, Senators Adams Oshiomhole and Monday Okpebholo paid him an appreciation visit over the approval by President Bola Tinubu for the completion of the road.

The meeting was also attended by the representatives of BUA Cement and the four road contractors, where the minister said his ministry has to find means to bridge the funding gap, adding that it was at that point that BUA came into the arrangement with the tax credit.

He also disclosed that the contractors handling the project would be mobilized with about N9b each which would be enough to complete a 6km stretch on their sections of the road.

Umahi said because of the complexity of the project and the socioeconomic importance of the road, 10km would be excised from the existing contractors for BUA to be completed in six months.

He said BUA must deploy the concrete technology on the 60km road with three contractors to handle the project to be able to meet the completion timeline.

Umahi, however, disclosed that the four contractors would need to sign an undertaking on the completion of the remaining sections of the road with adherence to the timetable.

The minister also complained about the attitude of the iron rod traders who have refused to bring down the cost despite the appreciation of the naira to the dollar.

He said he might have to report the issue to the president since the excuse for the rise in the cost of the steel components of the road was attributed to the foreign exchange.

Earlier, Oshiomhole said the Edo State caucus leadership was in the minister's office to commend Tinubu for being a listening leader and for his commitment to the welfare and well-being of Nigerians through many measures he is putting in place across critical sectors of the Nigerian economy while entrusting the implementation of the policies to trusted, capable and enthusiastic lieutenants like the Works Minister.

Jo Gideon, the Conservative MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, urged the Commons to accept that ""perfect"" fruit and vegetables are an ""artificial construct"", and suggested huge amounts of food waste could be avoided through a more accepting attitude to irregular produce.

As MPs considered food security in the UK and across the world, Ms Gideon said: ""Isn't it time for us to accept the fact that perfect fruit and vegetables is an artificial construct, that we've accepted without question for far too long.

""It certainly isn't beneficial to our health or food security, we waste huge quantities of natural produce that is perfectly good but isn't up to the exacting standard required by leading supermarkets.

""In recent years we have seen the introduction of a category of wonky fruit and veg, which allows less manicured products to find their way to market.

""Isn't it time now to welcome the fact that wonky doesn't have to be a separate range. Just as humans come in all shapes and sizes, so do our carrots and potatoes (which) grow in interesting shapes.""

Elsewhere Conservative MP Neil Hudson (Penrith and The Border) warned global food insecurity could lead to ""famine in the developed world"".

He told the Commons: ""As we've heard Ukraine is the bread-basket of Europe and importance in terms of supply for grains, sunflower, but also fertiliser as well.

""What we have seen through that crisis is a choking of supply out through the Black Sea and the deliberate and cynical decision by Putin to pull Russia out of, then leading to the subsequent collapse of the UN Black Sea grain initiative was the part of that that really chokes off supplies to the rest of the world.

""What we have seen as an unintended consequence, but I'm sure it probably is an intended consequence in terms of Putin, we are seeing that this is leading to food shortages and potential famine in the developing world and we as a country need to be very cognizant of that, so its so important that that Black Sea route really gets back up to speed.""

Mr Hudson also pointed to Houthi rebel attacks in the Rea Sea and its implications for trade, adding: ""Security of passage of goods through the world is part of global security and we need to be thinking about the Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal to make sure that these routes are viable as well.""

Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke (Dover) meanwhile urged the Government to reconsider its cuts to African swine flu checks.

Ms Elphicke said: ""The Government has decided to slash the African swine flu funding at the port of Dover and significantly reduce the capability to do checks.

""Now that doesn't protect our farmers or our food security, that decision puts our country and its farming at risk.""

Environment minister Robbie Moore insisted the Government knows ""just how important driving domestic food production is"".

He added: ""We produce as has been mentioned around 60%, or just over 60%, of the food that we need, and 73% of the food that we can grow or rear in the UK for all or part of the year.

""These figures have changed little over the last 20 years, but it is worth noting that it is the Government's desire to ensure that our domestic food production is enhanced.""",southwestfarmer.co.uk,news,South West Farmer,,0.3098039215686275,448880098,1,https://www.southwestfarmer.co.uk/resources/images/17888605/,

François Vasquez withdrew in December 2022. Midi Libre - K.S.

The president of the environmental group at the Montpellier municipal council comes to support the mayor on the decidedly very controversial CSR sector, and in passing scratches his former running mate at EELV, François Vasquez, the former vice-president of the Metropolis in charge of the sector, and which was excluded.

In four pages and many more questions addressed to Michaël Delafosse, Manu Reynaud, deputy mayor and president of the environmental group on the municipal council, entered the dance concerning the necessity (or not) of the & rsquo;CSR factory. The same one that made François Vasquez throw in the towel We knew the two ecologists were at odds; François Vasquez having distanced himself from the municipal group of Manu Reynaud. This time, the tension is raised another notch.

""I learned about his disagreement from the press, these are methods ?, asks the deputy mayor. François Vasquez was vice-president, so well placed to get things done. But it doesn't happen alone. It takes time, patience and determination. I call it abandonment of post. He went from the role of actor to that of spectator."" Abandonment of post or forced departure ? To be seen.

As for the CSR sector, the environmental manager proposes a third voice, highlighting a new issue: the end of the DSP of Ametyst on December 31, 2024 and pleading for a transient DSP ""Ametyst"".

""The CSR sector, of course, I have a negative a priori, underlines Manu Reynaud, but we must study all avenues. When we take our waste elsewhere ? Where is the ecological thinking ?"" Adding : ""Me, I I have to stay the course. Of course, we are all very dissatisfied with the progress of our policies in this area. The mayor first. We all want it to go faster!""

Which reminds us of his closeness and loyalty to Michaël Delafosse. Precisely what many members of EELV criticize him for. ""Am I too loyal to the mayor ?, he concludes. I take things objectively. The CSR is not something appropriate in the metropolis. But we don't leave a majority and a team with which we were elected."" A team ?

It's creating a methane problem that's tricky to solve - WTOP News,"BENGALURU, India (AP) -- Abinaya Tamilarasu said her four cows are part of the family. She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

""The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,"" she said.

The government recently launched a campaign for raising awareness and generating applications from interested households for Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana for Roof Top Solar Scheme. This new scheme provides free electricity to one crore households in India, who opt to install roof top solar electricity unit.

PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana is a Central Scheme that aims to provide free electricity to one crore households in India, who opt to install roof top solar electricity unit. Each month, homeowners will be able to receive 300 units of free power.

How much can you save and what is the subsidy

The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana offers an annual savings of roughly Rs 15,000 for a home consuming up to 300 units per month by installing a Roof Top Solar unit of 3 kW capacity. A family that generates its own power will save between Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,875 on their monthly bill.

In addition to reducing their electricity costs, the homeowners will be able to increase their revenue by selling any excess energy to DISCOMs.

Cap on the subsidy

Under the initiative, a 40% extra system cost is subsidised for systems between 2 and 3 kW in capacity, while 60% of the cost of the solar unit is covered for systems up to 2 kW in capacity. There is a 3 kW capacity cap on the subsidy. According to the current benchmark rates, a 1 kW system will receive a subsidy of Rs 30,000, a 2 kW system of Rs 60,000, and a 3 kW system or more of Rs 78,000.

In case if loan is availed to install Solar rooftop panel

Even after deducting the EMI of Rs 610 on the loan used to finance the solar unit, the savings would be roughly Rs 1,265 per month, or approximately Rs 15,000 annually. Households that do not take out a loan will save much more money.

Who are eligible to apply for the Scheme?

1. The applicant must be an Indian citizen.

2. Must own a house with a roof that is suitable for installing solar panels.

3. The household must have a valid electricity connection.

Recall that NEC had confirmed receiving recommendations from 16 Governors who expressed their support for establishing State Police to address the security challenges in the country.

Out of the 36 State Governors, 20 other undisclosed Governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Reacting via Channels Television's Politics Today on Friday, Makinde described the actions of the 16 Governors as a waste of time.

His words: ""I did not submit any memorandum on state police but my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time.

Infertility affects people regardless of age and it has become a global health issue, since it is estimated that 6-7/10 couples have infertility problems. Lately, more and more efforts have been made to find new prognostic factors and more in-depth explanations why specific causes of infertility happen to some patients. With regards to prognosis, nowadays, it is mostly associated with semen quality, female hormone levels (FSH, AMH), antral follicle count, age and partially the diagnosed cause of infertility. With regards to an in-depth understanding of infertility, due to major recent improvements in the methods of molecular biology (e.g., genetics, epigenetics, analytics), many molecular mechanisms have been associated with infertility, even on the level of gametes and embryos. Based on such data, new therapeutic approaches to overcome infertility have been suggested. This Special Issue calls for research and review papers addressing the impact of molecular mechanisms in an effort to understand male and female infertility. Research and review papers on animal models are also highly welcome for submission.

Normative action and self-regulation,"Sammanfattning: Ever since environmental issues appeared on the agenda of modern industrial society, through the work of whistle blowers such as Rachel Carson, Georg Borgström, Björn Gillberg and Hans Palmstierna, the Swedish state has exerted itself to project a green image. In practice this image has merely functioned as a defence for the legitimacy of industrial development. The state has created environmental protection legislation which has remained on paper and often has not had any influence on companies' environmental practice, because the decision makers (The Licensing Board for Environmental Protection and the Government) have generally given companies far too generous environmental terms. There has been a great discrepancy between Swedish environmental legislation ""in books and in action"", in other words, the difference between green image and green practice. Gradually, however, a new outlook on environmental issues has begun to emerge among industrial actors. This change has its roots in the environmental movement of the 1970s, and in the 1990s it is environmental NGOs which have brought the environment to the market place. Environmental organisations have exploited the market's own self-regulating mechanisms to bring about a change in industry's rationale and environmental practice. Scandals such as the Hallandsåsen tunnel have also forced companies to see their need for internal control, with the aid of tools such as environmental management systems. Another contributory factor is the breakthrough of environment-friendly production technique, which, to put it simply, means that the thrifty use of resources is a way to make money. These factors have interacted and helped to give the environment a new economic instrumentality, so that a green image can no longer remain on paper; it must be manifested in practice. Through a study of advanced practice in three strategically selected companies, Minna Gillberg shows how self-regulation in environmental matters emerges with the aid of the environmental management systems ISO 14001 and EMAS. This self-regulation has involved a bottom-up and upward-moving development spiral of norm formation, which is based on the ethical deliberation and normative action of environmental consumers, an instrumentality which is at once value-based, purposive and communicative. This is a process of change which requires a phronetic quest for knowledge, in which the ethical dimension in the form of sustainability is manifested through changed practice and rationality. In the studied areas of advanced practice, a pre-sustainable instrumental rationality has had to give way to a sustainable value-based rationality. In this connection we should not forget that there is still a long way to go before the advanced green practice of the present becomes tomorrow's established practice. To attain and maintain sustainability we must remain active and articulate our ethical preferences as consumers, citizens and fellow human beings. We must become a ""society of perceivers who are finely aware and richly responsible"".",avhandlingar.se,news,avhandlingar.se,,0.1686274509803922,448879057,1,,

It's creating a methane...,"BENGALURU, India (AP) - Abinaya Tamilarasu said her four cows are part of the family. She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

""The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,"" she said.

Experts around the world are working on new nuclear reactors. They should be more economical and safer than previous systems. However, researchers have now come to a completely different conclusion in a comprehensive study.

Der Spiegel 21st March 2024 read more ""

A new scientific study commissioned by the Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BASE) indicates that the market launch of alternative reactor concepts (also known as ""Generation IV"") is currently not on the horizon. ""Despite some intensive advertising by manufacturers, we currently see no development that would make the construction of alternative reactor types on a large scale likely in the coming years. On the contrary: ""From a safety perspective, we should expect the potential advantages of these reactor concepts to be outweighed by the disadvantages and the questions that remain unresolved,"" says BASE President Christian Kühn, and emphasises that ""The concepts solve neither the need to find a repository for radio-active waste nor the pressing issues of climate protection."" The alternative reactor concepts, which include SMRs, are also often linked to the hope that they can minimise or even resolve the safety risks and disposal problems associated with nuclear power. To examine these claims, BASE commissioned the ""Analysis and evaluation of the development status, the safety and the regulatory framework for so-called novel reactor concepts"" study. The scientific work was carried out by the Öko-Institut, the Technical University of Berlin and the Physikerbüro Bremen.

Novel nuclear power plant designs do not resolve the technology's fundamental challenge of hazardous nuclear waste, a report commissioned by Germany's Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BASE) has found. ""None of the alternative reactor types would make a final repository redundant,"" the government agency said. Despite efforts by producers of so-called Generation IV reactors to ""intensively advertise"" the concept's supposed benefits, BASE said it ""could not detect any trends that would make the construction of alternative reactor types at an industrial scale likely in the next years."" On the contrary, the disadvantages and uncertainties from a security perspective would continue to outweigh the technology's advantages, the study led by the Institute for Applied Ecology (Öko-Institut) found. New nuclear plant designs, such as small modular reactors (SMR), would not only perpetuate the difficult long-term question of nuclear waste disposal, but also had little to offer for solving short-term climate action problems, BASE added. The report looked at seven novel reactor types, which according to their producers are more efficient in nuclear fuel use and run more safely and reliably, are economically viable, and cause less radioactive waste. While some of these improvements seem plausible, the report said that central questions regarding safety remain unanswered with all new concepts. ""In some areas, there are even disadvantages compared to today's light water reactors,"" which remain the favoured technology in six surveyed countries (USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Poland and Belgium). Alternative reactor types still required ""substantial"" research and development, and it would likely still take several decades before they can be deployed at a relevant scale, the researchers added.

She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

However, many expatriates are unaware of these requirements, inadvertently becoming non-compliant with the IRS and subject to penalties, including criminal charges. To delve deeper into this issue, we've invited an expert in the field to shed light on potential solutions.

Claudemir Ramos, an expert with over a decade of experience in Brazilian law, brings his expertise to the American market through his company, CR Accounting & Consulting LLC. Renowned in the Brazilian accounting field, he extends his influence by providing valuable insights through influential articles on tax regulations in both countries, helping to disseminate knowledge about tax rules to a wider audience.

Our specialist notes that US-born individuals or green card holders living abroad may qualify for the IRS Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure. This program enables them to fulfill tax obligations without penalties for late filing, provided the lack of compliance was due to unawareness.

Tax obligations include filing annual income tax returns for global income, submitting FATCA Form 8938 for foreign financial accounts meeting specific thresholds, disclosing ownership in foreign corporations exceeding 10% via Form 5471, reporting investments in foreign funds with Form 8621, declaring third-party gifts over $100,000 with Form 3520, and disclosing foreign bank accounts or assets over $10,000 with Form 114 - FBAR.

Qualification for the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedure includes living outside the US for at least 330 days in one of the last three years and certifying that failure to file taxes and FBAR was due to an honest lack of awareness of US tax laws.

If you qualify for the program, you will need to submit the last three years of overdue tax returns, the last six years of FBAR, a comprehensive statement explaining asset acquisition, and payment of calculated income tax due with applicable interest.

Interests: zeolites; microporous and mesoporous materials; pollution remediation

Mankind is currently facing urgent challenges in meeting rising demands for clean water as the available supplies of freshwater are decreasing due to population growth and extended water pollution. This also includes inadequate water treatment infrastructure due to global climate change and increasing consumption of ultrahigh-quality water from various modern and sophisticated industrial branches. The protection of water treatment systems against potential chemical and biological contamination, in the time of increasing diversity, is also becoming a critical issue in water resources planning. Environmental requirements are becoming of great importance in today´s society, since there is an increased interest in the industrial use of renewable resources. Biomimetics and bioinspiration is one of the most progressive, recently developed sciences, which deals with nature and living systems in order to provide sustainable life for future generations. With a more complex insight into living organisms and an understanding of their functions, the ability to mimic nature has increased dramatically over several decades and, thus, nature-driven solutions have brought technological progress to a higher level. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned discipline offers then a substantial scientific portfolio for the development of current material chemistry, specifically for novel nanoscale adsorbent synthesis. It is supposed that basic constructional processes of matter like biomineralisation, biomimetics, supramolecular preorganisation or interfacial molecular recognition (templating), and other recent techniques and new advanced nanomaterials contribute to a certain portfolio for potential Green Synthesis or Processing of the future. Moreover, there is a gradual insistence that clean industrial production, water reuse and solid waste recycling can provide sustainable living for the next generations.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) management can be defined as the discipline associated with the generation, storage, collection, transfer, processing, and disposal of MSW, in a way which is governed by the best principles of public health, economics, engineering, aesthetics, and other environmental considerations. Waste utilization management is explored in the context of the dominant principle of the circular economy: waste should be processed into secondary resources, reducing environmental risks. It is emphasized that separate waste collection is an important condition for creating a responsible ""garbage culture"" in society. Secondary methods (recycling) are the next stage, with mechanical, chemical, and thermal techniques used on the waste for processing in order to obtain an usable end result.

The main objective of the contributions for this Special Issue of Processes is to provide a view of the state of the art and the future prospects of Green Synthesis (Processing), with special emphasis on environmentally friendly, biocompatible nanoadsorbents and using natural renewable products or resources in order to support their valorization in environmental protection and sustainable development.

Alberto González Amador, the colleague of the president of the Community of Madrid, IsabelDíaz Ayuso, has been summoned to testify as an investigator for two tax crimes and one of document falsification for having used shell companies and having issued false invoices to reduce to the maximum the corporate tax. The Tax Agency (AEAT), in charge of inspecting his company, has detected a fraud of 350,000 euros in two fiscal years.

Until yesterday, Díaz Ayuso's entourage had called both the AEAT investigation and the prosecution's complaint an operation orchestrated by Moncloa to destroy her politically. However, the interlocutory admission to the procedure and summons as investigated of his partner, González Amador, and four other people he would have used for the false invoicing, has meant a change of script. The popular leader has suffered severe wear and tear since the alleged fraud of her partner, with whom she lives, became known. The president of the PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, or she herself will have to decide which firewall they will use to stop this crisis.

The head of the court of inquiry number 19 of Madrid has initiated preliminary proceedings for two alleged crimes of tax fraud and an alleged crime of forgery in a commercial document against González Amador, after receiving the complaint from the Prosecutor's Office.

The environment of González Amador intends to accept a possible nullity of the proceedings because the public ministry made known through a press release the negotiations it had held with the businessman's defense in the search for an agreement that would stop the judicial process.

The public ministry decided to make public a chronology of events after Díaz Ayuso's political environment intentionally leaked the negotiations in a biased manner. In fact, the Madrid Bar Association has denounced the Prosecutor's Office for having given information about González's attempt to seek an agreement, acknowledge the facts and pay a fine to avoid a trial. However, tax sources take it for granted that this would in no case justify a nullity of the actions.

This matter began with a Treasury inspection in González in May 2022, which ended with a complaint from the Tax Agency, through the State Attorney's Office, and another from the Prosecutor's Office for the possible commission of three crimes.

What is imputed to the Ayuso couple is to have used shell companies to issue invoices for work not carried out and thus reduce corporate tax as much as possible. According to the AEAT report, accessed by La Vanguardia, with this system of falsehoods the Ayuso couple paid four times less in taxes in 2020 and earned eight times more than in 2018, when they paid as tax quota 9,371 euros for a turnover figure of 358,773 euros. Specifically, in 2020 he invoiced 2,339,111 euros thanks to having mediated in a mask business in the midst of a pandemic and paying 2,806 euros as a tax fee. This figure assumes that he paid 0.12% in corporate tax.

In 2021 he balanced the data a little and invoiced 1.3 million euros, for which he paid 9,000 euros in taxes.

In addition to Alberto González, a ""possible front man"" is also being investigated, a Mexican citizen named Maximiliano Eduardo N. G. He allegedly issued two invoices for 1.6 million euros for work not carried out, one through a company of Mexico and another from the Ivory Coast. During the inspection he admitted that he has no income and only lives on a helping hand from his mother. González tried to cancel these invoices when he was discovered by the tax authorities, but the ploy failed to convince the inspector.

The other three investigated are three men from Arahal (Seville), who created companies with virtually no activity to issue invoices for having allegedly produced health certificates for Marxell, González's company, which in turn were intended for the Quirón hospital group .

The judge notes how the Tax Agency describes González's behavior as ""false"" with the aim of ""reducing and even completely neutralizing his taxation"".",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,-0.3490196078431372,448877569,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_8a32a.png,

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

If ratified, those found guilty could be sentenced to life in imprisonment.

""The penalties will apply to anybody who participated in the displacement of people. Government officials, armed groups, or anybody who enabled displacement will be held accountable when the proclamation is ratified,"" Eshetu Dese (Amb.), an advisor to the Peace minister who participated in the drafting process, told The Reporter.

He disclosed it had been under review by peers at the Justice Ministry for eight months before it was forwarded to the Office of the Prime Minister. The legislation will be reviewed by the Council of Ministers before it is tabled to Parliament for a vote.

Human rights bodies say the legislation is crucial and has been delayed by more than a decade. The IDP proclamation is Ethiopia's implementation of the Kampala Convention adopted by the AU in 2012.

Ethiopia ratified the convention in 2020 and the Peace Ministry was tasked with implementation. But the absence of legislation like the IDP proclamation meant the Ministry could not carry out the work, which entails providing protection and assistance to IDPs.

Sources say the government has been dragging its feet in ratifying the IDP proclamation in order to put off activating the Kampala Convention and the subsequent burden of assisting IDPs.

The country hosts over 3.25 million IDPs, according to the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC). Most are concentrated in Tigray (nearly one million), Oromia and Amhara.

Two thirds of the IDP population were displaced by conflict and security issues, according to Rakeb Messele, deputy head of the Commission.

This week, Her office deliberated with the Peace Ministry and the Consortium of Ethiopian Human Rights Organizations (CEHRO), a group of 18 CSOs, on the state of IDPs in Ethiopia. The meeting focused on how to rehabilitate displaced populations effectively - a topic that participating IDP representatives were quick to put down.

They called for the need to prioritize shelter and food needs for short-term survival.

Human rights bodies and regional officials described the severe living conditions in IDP camps and blamed the absence of institutional responsibility and legal venues, coupled with security issues and a lack of resources, for the crisis facing millions of displaced Ethiopian citizens.

Most IDPs uprooted from the disputed regions of Wolkait, Raya, Tselemt and others are suffering in schools, IDP centers and the streets of Mekele, according to Zewdu Kiros, head of the Social Affairs and Recovery office in Tigray.

""The crimes perpetrated on the people of Tigray from all directions was immense. We have no words to describe the types of dangers IDPs are suffering currently. We could not return them to their former homes and land. We could not reintegrate them. We could not give them shelter and food. We can only hope they will return to their land soon,"" he said.

Though there are nearly one million IDPs in Tigray, nearly five million people in the region need immediate humanitarian assistance. A further 15 million people require urgent aid across the rest of Ethiopia as they suffer from the consequences of conflict, drought, and natural disasters.

Zewdu disclosed that no less than 70,000 residents of Tigray who fled to Sudan during the war are caught up in another conflict as Khartoum hosts its own bloody civil war.

There are significant IDP populations in other regional states as well. People displaced by protracted conflict in western Oromia have fled to Amhara and Benishangul-Gumuz. There are also IDPs spread across the Somali and Afar regional states.

Peace Ministry officials and other entities recently began facilitating the return of IDPs to western Oromia, mostly those who were sheltered in the town of Debre Birhan in the Amhara Regional state. However, people representing the IDPs say they cannot return because the security concerns that pushed them out in the first place are still a real threat.

Government officials conceded they cannot cover food, medicine, and shelter needs, or compensation, for IDPs due to a lack of funding.",thereporterethiopia.com,news,thereporterethiopia.com,Ashenafi Endale,-0.0117647058823529,448877529,1,https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Millions-of-IDPs.jpg,

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

Anurag Kashyap's direction has always been considered to be unique. The director, who has been showing his acting prowess also, lately went on a social media rant, aiming at those who 'waste his time'. Kashyap went on to say that henceforth he will be charging anyone who wants to secure a meeting with him.

Anurag's post read, ""I wasted a lot of time trying to help newcomers and mostly ended up with mediocre sh*t. So Now onwards I don't want to waste my time with meeting random people who think they're creative geniuses. So I will now have rates. If someone wants to meet me for 10-15 minutes I will charge 1 lac, for half hour 2 lacs and for 1 hour 5 lacs. That's the rate. I am tired of wasting time meeting people. If you really think you can afford it, call me or stay the f**k away. And all paid in advance.""

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

Abinaya Tamilarasu said her four cows are part of the family. She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

It's creating a methane problem that's tricky to solve,"Abinaya Tamilarasu said her four cows are part of the family. She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family's land.

""Our family cannot let farming go, it's a way of life for us,"" said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she's ""still happy we have our cows.""

India is the world's largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming.

India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there's some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government's National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals.

The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

""Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,"" said Meenesh Shah, the board's chairman.

Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. ""These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,"" he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there's currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

""Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,"" she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers' livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

""Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,"" said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn't reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India's farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India's methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said.

""You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,"" he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India's high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world's largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

""In this light, India's agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,"" Shah said. Because of its large population, India's per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won't be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future.

""The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,"" she said.

However, in the previous two years - 2022 and 2021 - four reminders were sent out in each year.

And two reminders to pay were issued in 2020.

The data has been released under a Freedom of Information request from the Peterborough Telegraph.

The names of the councillors concerned have not been released and it is not known how many councillors have received reminders.

The data also shows that over the same four years that no councillor has ever been required to appear in court for non-payment of Council Tax and that no summons to appear in court have needed to be issued either.

Council leader Councillor Mohammed Farooq said: ""Council policy has always been for collection rates to be in line with other local authorities and we have been achieving that or exceeding it.

""I strongly believe that members who are running the council and responsible for it, and that is all councillors, should really set an example to everybody else.""

Because of course council tax , difficult as it can be to pay, is used for developing vital services and supporting vulnerable people.""

The council process for recovering Council Tax is to issue a two reminders and a final notice.

This accomplishment comes amidst recent regulatory changes in the Indian cryptocurrency landscape. Moreover, it highlights KuCoin's commitment to strengthening its position in key global markets.

In the press release, Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, emphasized the exchange's dedication to user asset security. He stated, ""KuCoin places utmost importance on user asset security. By successfully completing this registration in India, we are set to enhance the Indian users' experience and reaffirm our dedication to compliance and security.""

Lyu also highlighted the importance of this milestone in advancing the conversation on crypto adoption in India, with a focus on user security and trading excellence. Furthermore, he expressed enthusiasm for supporting local innovation and boosting the sustainable development of India's blockchain ecosystem through investment and educational initiatives.

""We are eager to support local innovation and build enduring educational partnerships to contribute significantly to India's blockchain ecosystem,"" Lyu added. KuCoin's emergence as the first FIU-compliant global crypto exchange in India is expected to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry in the country. In addition, the exchange welcomes partners to join them in promoting the development of the cryptocurrency industry in India.

Furthermore, CoinDCX CEO and co-founder Sumit Gupta congratulated the KuCoin team for achieving a milestone by becoming the first FIU-compliant global crypto exchange in India. ""Congrats, KuCoin team! CoinDCX was the 1st crypto asset exchange to be an FIU-registered entity in Dec 2023 and I am now glad to see a global exchange registered with FIU-Ind,"" Gupta stated in a post on X.

In addition, the CoinDCX CEO remarked, ""I believe that a compliant crypto ecosystem with only FIU compliant players in India is good for everyone and also keeps the bad actors out."" Moreover, Gupta expressed optimism toward other foreign crypto exchanges mimicking KuCoin's achievement. He said, ""Looking forward to see others getting registered too and serving Indian customers in a compliant manner.""

Bybit, a popular overseas crypto exchange, faced a major setback in India lately. The Bybit iOS app was removed from the Apple App Store on March 22 amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the country. Speculations on social media suggest it's due to regulatory uncertainty.

Despite this, the Bybit Pro app remains on the App Store, and existing users face no issues. Moreover, Bybit's website is also accessible. OKX is also set to cease operations in India, which has led to unrest within the country's Web3 community.

Earlier, in late December 2023, the FIU took action against foreign crypto exchanges, including Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, and Huobi. The regulatory body accused them of illegal operations through offshore entities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Hence, notices were sent to these exchanges. Moreover, in January 2024, websites and apps of Binance, KuCoin, OKX and others were blocked.

In July 2023, the Prime Minister convened with his cabinet and passed an obscure piece of legislation dubbed 'Government Secret Information Classification and Protection.' The contents of this regulation had been off limits until The Reporter managed to obtain a copy earlier this week.

The legislation has far-reaching implications, yet it was passed seemingly out of the blue without due deliberation with stakeholders, particularly media institutions and human rights bodies.

""Failure to establish a system to classify and protect government classified information"" and associated ""negative impacts on national security and interests"" were driving factors behind the legislation, according to its preamble.

""It has become necessary to protect government classified information from being illegally disclosed, destroyed, damaged, altered and transmitted,"" it reads.

The legislation empowers the government to classify any information it deems is of concern to national security, and limit access to the information to officials with security clearance. Among the criteria it outlines for obtaining security clearance is a process of verification and inquiry into an individual's ""loyalty, character, trustworthiness, and reliability.""

The regulation introduces a four-tier hierarchy for classified information - Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, and Restricted. It permits classified information to remain secret for up to 30 years, with a clause that allows for extensions upon government request.

The document does not specify the process or the organ responsible for determining what qualifies as classified information, but sources close to the matter told The Reporter Parliament would be given the mandate to review and classify information upon request from the executive.

It is the first legislation of its kind in Ethiopia, where the practice of classifying information has never been formalized and officials habitually, and sometimes arbitrarily, cite national interests or security as justification for withholding information.

Nonetheless, media experts worry the new law can be used as a pretext to slam the doors on access to information.

Article 29 of the Constitution states that ""freedom of expression and information cannot be limited on account of the content or effect of the point of view expressed. Legal limitations can be laid down in order to protect the wellbeing of the youth, and the honor and reputation of individuals. Any propaganda for war as well as the public expression of opinion intended to injure human dignity shall be prohibited by law.""

The Constitution does not bar 'freedom of expression and information' under the context of national security.

The media professionals and legal experts who spoke to The Reporter all agree it is common practice for governments to classify sensitive information. But what complicates Ethiopia's case is that the country has introduced legislation to limit access to information before passing laws that guarantee access to information.

The administration of Abiy Ahmed (PhD) repealed the 13-year old Mass Media and Access to Information proclamation to replace it with a new Media proclamation in 2021. The new legislation omitted references to 'access to information' and is still in effect today. The authorities said their intention was to split 'media' and 'access to information' into two pieces of legislation, but the latter has yet to materialize.

There was a committee tasked with drafting the access to information proclamation, but it was dissolved following the outbreak of war in Tigray in November 2020. The responsibility for drafting the legislation has since been redirected to the Institution of the Ombudsman.

""Government document classification is customary, globally. What worries me is that the government is not doing general document classification,"" says Befekadu Hailu, former Zone9 blogger, human rights advocate and director of the Center for Advancement of Rights and Democracy (CARD).

Some experts who spoke with The Reporter suggested the government chose to introduce the regulation at a time when it needed to cover up reports and information relating to serious failures in corruption, domestic conflict, internal party issues, as well as foreign affairs.

But the regulation makes exemptions for information relating to issues such as corruption, deeming it public.

""But there's no way to check if the government is classifying information to cover up a corruption case or not. When the government says certain information is secret, then nobody can know what is behind it,"" said Befekadu. ""This is worrying.""

He suspects internal information leaks are behind the legislation's timing, and stresses the threats it poses to the media's access to information.

Befekadu observes parts of the regulation, such as a clause defining national security as ""protecting and defending citizens and territorial unity, peace, and stability from threats,"" are ambiguous and politicized.

""Which document or information is really dangerous to the state? Is it because an official said so, or is it really because the information carries risks? Government officials might use this regulation to muffle access to information,"" said Befekadu.

He cautions that legislation relating to access to information needs to be carefully crafted so as not to leave room for misinterpretation and abuse of power.

""Freedom of expression has three major pillars. Access to information is one, the right to hold an opinion and protection from indoctrination is the second. The right to speech is the third,"" he said. ""Access to information might be barred in the context of national security. The question is, is it state interest or government interest when a certain piece of information is categorized as secret? It is a thin line.""

Endale Haile (PhD) is the chief of the Institution of the Ombudsman and was part of the drafting process for the regulation.

He says the legislation does not affect access to information, arguing it poses advantages for the media.

""The implementation of the regulation will not affect the access to information and freedom of expression. The problem in Ethiopia is, almost all government information is withheld as secret. All government institutions keep all information secret. This is because there was no law that enables public institutions to classify information as 'secret' and public. This regulation solves that problem. Now, under this regulation, institutions must make public information which is not classified as secret,"" Endale told The Reporter.

Still, he admits the potential for blurring the line between party and state issues in classifying information.

""Because there is no clear line between party and government in Ethiopia, it might be difficult to ascertain whether classified information is party information or government information that truly affects national interests,"" said Endale.

He cited information pertaining to the military, GERD, and Ethiopian Airlines among examples of what could qualify as classified information.

Nonetheless, Endale recognizes it is unusual to introduce legislation that limits access to information without laws that guarantee it.

""The freedom of information proclamation should have been ratified ahead of the media proclamation. This is a paradox,"" he told The Reporter.

Currently, Ethiopia does not have the 'Freedom of Information Proclamation.' The Ombudsman institution is currently drafting this proclamation.

Befekadu worries about the potential implications of the Government Secret Information Classification and Protection on the media.

He observes that under prevailing practice, officials routinely deny the media access to information on grounds of national security. Communications departments across public institutions, as well as the Government Communication Service, play an active role in hampering media access to information.

Befekadu recommends two remedies.

The first is to curtail the government's power to limit access to information. The second is introducing legislation that guarantees access to information, balancing the scales.

""Accessing information and freedom of expression is a right. It is not a crime. Freedom of expression is natural. This means there is no law that can give you that right, the only thing laws can do is protect that right. Legislation is also needed to limit people and institutions from inflicting damage by abusing that natural right. So limiting that right is essential. However, that limitation itself needs to be limited,"" he said. ""Otherwise, access to information will be eroded.""

He argues that information should only be classified if it can cause conflict or clashes between ethnic groups.

""Access to information should not be prohibited just because that information exposes government failures,"" said Befekadu.",thereporterethiopia.com,news,thereporterethiopia.com,Ashenafi Endale,-0.1137254901960785,448874783,1,https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IN-DEPTH-3.jpg,

Makinde, who appeared on Channels Television's Politics Today program on Friday night, called the memoranda a ""waste of time."" He argued that focusing on memoranda delays progress on achieving a more effective police force.

The Oyo State governor clarified that his refusal to submit a memorandum wasn't due to arrogance but a belief in a different approach. He did not elaborate on his preferred solution.

""My position is very clear about state police,"" Makinde said. ""I see it (memoranda) quite frankly, as a waste of our time... You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.

""I did not submit not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde's comments come after the National Economic Council (NEC) confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors expressing support for state police as a solution to Nigeria's security challenges.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work. It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly and then at the state level, we get our state houses of assembly to pass this law,"" the governor said.

The debate on state police is likely to continue, with Makinde's comments highlighting the need for a more concrete plan to address Nigeria's security issues.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre urged MPs to back his motion to topple the government over its planned increase to the carbon tax.

In response, the Liberals painted Poilievre as a climate change denier intent on letting the planet burn while dismantling a tax-and-rebate program that pads people's pockets with quarterly cheques that mostly offset the carbon levy.

If Poilievre's motion had carried and a majority of MPs had voted no confidence in the government, this Parliament would have been dissolved and the country would be heading into an election.

In an address to Conservative caucus, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre had announced that he is bringing forward a motion of non-confidence calling on Justin Trudeau and his NDP-Liberal MPs to spike the hike or call a carbon tax election.

The federal government has decided to hike the carbon tax on April 1 by 23 percent.

""Now, in a desperate last-ditch effort to save his historically unpopular government, Trudeau is lying to Canadians about the carbon tax rebates.

He also has a thought for ordinary taxpayers putting off the inevitable with less than a month left in tax-filing season: ""Get it done."" (And double-check your work.)

Werfel, who will hit the one-year mark at the helm of the IRS in April, said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press that the agency will expand its pursuit of high-wealth tax dodgers with new initiatives in the coming months and is using tools like artificial intelligence to ferret out abuses and taking the fight to sophisticated scammers.

That doesn't mean the IRS has undergone a complete image makeover. There's still plenty of criticism to go around, including from Republican lawmakers who accuse the agency of heavy-handed overreach.

""We're kind of like the NFL referee -- when we get the call right or wrong, we get booed, and we're OK with that,"" Werfel said.

But efforts to crack down on high-wealth tax cheats are starting to bite, he says, and that should mean more money coming in to fund the government.

""It's having an impact,"" Werfel said. Large corporate filers and others are ""taking notice that the IRS is ramping up our scrutiny, and I think that will inevitably result in more compliance"" -- and revenue.

Werfel is promising taxpayers better service this year as he works to repair the agency's image as an outdated and maligned tax collector. But it's a tall order for a federal agency that even he has referred to as ""iconically unpopular"" with the American public.

""We have some myth-busting to do,"" Werfel said, referring to alarmist and inaccurate Republican claims that the agency plans to hire 87,000 armed agents ready to harass middle-income earners.

""We are not,"" he said. ""We are hiring phone assisters armed only with phone headsets. We're hiring accountants armed only with calculators.""

Werfel took over an agency that was understaffed and drowning in unprocessed tax returns after decades of underfunding.

Shortly before he arrived, the IRS received an $80 billion infusion under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. But Republicans have been chipping away at that money.

Last year's debt ceiling and budget cuts deal between Republicans and the White House resulted in $1.4 billion rescinded from the agency and a separate agreement to take $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years and divert those funds to other programs. And this past January, a debt ceiling deal meant to avoid a government shutdown frontloaded the full $20 billion cut to this year.

Werfel has been in a race against time to show how improvements to the agency can benefit taxpayers. He said agency priorities include customer service improvements like answering the phones faster and making sure the rich ""pay their fair share.""

The agency also is piloting a program for people to file their taxes directly to the agency without the help -- or cost -- of private commercial software.

Werfel said more than 50,000 people in 12 states have started using the new Direct File system to complete their taxes. The free online tool is available for people with very simple W-2s and who claim a standard deduction for their federal income taxes.

The Direct File rollout has drawn some consternation from commercial software firms like Intuit, as well as Republicans who argue there are free filing programs that already exist.

But so far, Werfel says, ""people are telling us that they found it to be quick and easy, and everyone certainly loves that it's free. And their No. 1 question is: Are we going to have this again next year?""

Werfel sounds optimistic, but he's not ready to give an answer yet on the program's future.

Overall, Werfel says, the agency has added ""more tools to IRS.gov in the last two years than in the previous 20"" to make tax-filing easier. Wait times for answering phone calls are at two minutes or less.

Werfel sat for an interview in an auditorium at the IRS headquarters in Washington, where he said sustained funding is critical to make up for past shortcomings. He said IRS workers are ""passionate about helping taxpayers. And when we don't have the funding to provide them the tools or the training, they're upset because they can't do enough to help the taxpayers.""

Major new initiatives in recent months have included an aggressive pursuit of high-wealth earners who don't pay their full tax obligations, such as people who improperly deduct personal flights on corporate jets and those who just don't file at all.

The private jets, in particular, are a place where ""many corporations are sloppy with their bookkeeping,"" he said. Werfel said the agency's crackdown there ""sets the tone for the American people"" that everyone has to pay what's due.

Werfel said the agency also has put new focus on ""being accessible, answering the phones, keeping our walking centers open and updating our website so that people can do things more with the IRS without ever leaving their smartphone or their tablet.""

Even so, he allows, the agency still isn't technologically where it needs to be.

There is still an operating pay phone located in the hallway at the IRS building.

Lai Wei Sieng of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said those who would purchase luxury goods were high-income earners, namely some of those in the middle-income M40 group and a majority of the high-income T20.

""Those who can afford to buy luxury goods would not be turned off by the additional 5% or 10% increase in the price,"" he told FMT.

Earlier this week, the finance ministry said it was finalising several policies related to the high-value goods tax, including the type of items which would be levied. The ministry is also looking at the price threshold that would determine what is a high value item.

Lai also said the proposed rate of between 5% and 10% was reasonable, when compared to other countries like China and Indonesia.

China's luxury tax is reported to be between 30% and 40% on imported high-end goods, with the Chinese government considering lowering it by 10%. In Indonesia, the tax ranges from 10% to 95%.

Lai said the expected revenue from the tax meant that the government could channel the funds for development and help reduce the national debt, which had ballooned to RM1.08 trillion in 2022.

""The HVGT can help the government without affecting the cost of living for many,"" he said, adding that the government's plans to allow tourists to claim relevant tax refunds before departure would not discourage them from buying luxury goods.

Yeah Kim Leng of Sunway University said the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio has been declining steadily over the decades and now ranks lower than some of Malaysia's regional peers.

In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that Malaysia's tax revenue-to-GDP ratio stood at just 11.8%, lower than Thailand (16.4%), the Philippines (18.1%) and Vietnam (18.2%).

Yeah, who sits on a special advisory body to assist Anwar Ibrahim as finance minister, said higher tax revenue is needed to restore the government's fiscal position that has been in deficit since 1998.

""Expanding the tax base (including via the HVGT) will strengthen the government's fiscal resilience, allowing for better response to economic downturns,"" he said.

A broadening of the tax base will also increase the government's fiscal resilience and enhance its ability to mount counter-cyclical spending in the event of an economic downturn caused by external factors.

""The small tax base coupled with the past legacy of pro-cyclical and deficit government spending that resulted in a rapid increase in public debt is not sustainable in the medium term,"" he said.

Detectives handling the matter said they realized some of the fertilizer in 34 bags had stones, fake granules, and sheep and goat wastes.

These included fur.

Some of the samples brought to the DCI offices at Koibatek had granules resembling cattle licking salt and black stones and others had goat or sheep fur, police said.

The officers in Eldàma Ravine on Friday, March 22 received reports from two members of the public from Poror Village of Poror/ Arama Location within Koibatek Sub County that on different dates in March 2024, each of them bought the subsidized fertilizer from National Cereals and Produce Board Depot at Eldama Ravine totalling 34 bags of NPK fertilizer.

The complainants said on opening the bags ready for planting, he realized it was not real fertilizer.

The Sub County Security committee inspected the bags brought and informed the management of NCPB Koibatek to recall all 2,650 bags already supplied to farmers so far.

Efforts to recall the bags were ongoing amid outcry some had already used the fake products.

Police are investigating the matter.

This comes at a time when farmers from various parts of the country are facing long queues at different depots in search of government-subsidized fertiliser, amidst reported shortages of the commodity in the region.

President William Ruto on Wednesday warned manufacturers and distributors of fake farm inputs saying those found culpable will face the 'music they deserve'.

He spoke amid a public outcry over alleged fake fertilisers and uncertified crop seeds being distributed in the market.

On Tuesday, detectives in Kakamega County impounded 700 bags of fertiliser that farmers said was insolvable as it was mixed with stones contrary to manufacture specifications.

Ruto on Wednesday said the country is experiencing fertiliser shortages but assured Kenyans that the government will ship more fertilisers for planting by April 10.

He attributed the shortage of fertilisers in the country to delayed shipment due to the logistical challenges affecting the Red Sea corridor.

The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has accused a Kenyan-based regional fertilizer merchant of fraud after it emerged the firm supplied substandard fertilizer to NCPB.

Documents tabled before the National Assembly Agriculture Committee by KEBS showed how the firm supplied substandard fertilizer for over a year undetected.

KEBS said the firm applied for certification on January 13 and secured approval on January 28, 2023.

KEBS Managing Director Esther Ngari told MPs that initially, the company had complied with all requirements which prompted the agency to issue them permits to supply organic fertilizer but later committed fraud by violating the standards.

The standards agency certified the company to supply organic fertilizer but the firm supplied diatomite, which relies on a biologically generated form of Silica to enhance soil conditions, to NCPB stores.

""During our surveillance, we sampled the product that was being sold in agrovets and finally got intelligence that the product was being supplied through NCPB stores. Test reports showed the product failed on organic matter,"" Ngari said.

For months, farmers unknowingly purchased the product bearing KEBS certification.

KEBS said it launched a probe following a tip-off from the public, seizing 5,840 bags in a surveillance raid.

Following the intelligence, NCPB sampled the product in over 59 ware stores across the country which led to the suspension of the product permits amid fears that the product may still be in circulation.

The agency said it had initiated legal proceedings against the supplier even as it remained unclear on the product quantity in the market.

""We have written to the Director of Public Prosecution so that we can be able to prosecute the matter under the standard act,"" said Ngari.",the-star.co.ke,news,The Star,https,-0.1372549019607843,448870823,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8Gr5l9_wnM7M_OS2oeYy7_4SJZvOBhQ6gmHjPPK8QsGQ-TggHWAc1IIRQl255VJEQPYJc6ZTHJ_RHOdnR1meNSM2kTzpRM5hUksH0QPT=s1000,

""These are not just pieces of paper with words -- these are flyers that are intended to harass and intimidate members of our community and dehumanize them based on their religion, gender or sexual orientation, race or other characteristic,"" Ward said.

At a news conference in San Carlos, Ward announced his legislation, AB 3024: The Stop Hate Littering Act, which aims to provide additional protection for those targeted by such flyers, posters and similar material.

Last summer, in historically Jewish communities, thousands of anti-Semitic flyers were placed on windshields and doorsteps in San Carlos, Del Cerro, Allied Gardens and other areas.

Rabbi Devorah Marcus from Temple Emanu-El in Del Cerro says she supports the proposed legislation, after seeing the effects of hate littering in her community.

""It was very disheartening. I think especially for our elderly neighbors who feel like they're watching terrible things from history come back around and repeat themselves,"" Rabbi Marcus said.

After the hate littering in his district, San Diego City Councilmember Raul Campillo pushed for tougher penalties.

""By doing this bill at the state level, we give ourselves wide-ranging legally strong legislation and we protect as many people as we can,"" Campillo said.

Ward says his legislation would update the definition of ""intimidation by threat of violence"" to include hate littering, making it easier for law enforcement to prosecute those responsible -- including fines up to $25,000.

""We hope that by updating, it would deter these acts from happening in the first place -- that offenders can be held accountable for their actions,"" Ward said.

Senate leaders are engaged in an intense debate on major Medicare legislation.

These leaders are concentrating on the provision of a prescription drug benefit of unknown cost in the Medicare program. Taxpayers can rest assured that the actual costs of these various drug benefit proposals will far exceed the standard Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections.

While leading Senate legislation would also make technical changes in the administration of the current program, none of these Senate Medicare proposals would undertake any meaningful reform of the Medicare program itself. Meanwhile, Medicare faces a deadly combination of growing financial and managerial problems and will have to absorb the first wave of the massive retirement of 77 million baby boomers beginning in just nine years.

Official Washington's curious political paralysis, plus the cavalier congressional willingness to add an expensive new drug benefit to an already financially troubled program without any serious structural changes, is directly contrary to independent advice and analysis routinely offered by responsible officials from the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

But it does not have to be this way. Senate leaders are very well aware that a solid model for reform of Medicare, at least for the next generation of retirees, is readily at hand. The majority of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare in 1999, and President George W. Bush in July 2001, proposed major changes to transform Medicare into a program that resembles the popular and successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) that covers Members of Congress, the White House staff, and millions of federal workers and retirees and their families. Senior citizens can rest assured that Washington's political class, over a period of 42 years, did not create an inferior system for themselves or their families. Yet the leading Senate bills fall far short of this model for Medicare reform.

Members of the Senate must address serious policy questions this year: Will Senate consideration of Medicare legislation advance the progress of genuine reform and enable millions of current and future Medicare patients to exercise greater personal control over their health plans and benefits? Will Senate legislation strengthen or weaken the doctor-patient relationship in the Medicare program? Will Senate legislation enhance the access of seniors to the medical treatments and procedures that they need, including advanced medical technology?

Will Senate legislation strengthen or weaken Medicare's financial condition? Leading Senate legislation would add a drug benefit; but, based on all of the proposals that have surfaced thus far, the Medicare program itself would be left unimproved. Building on a structurally flawed program will hasten the day when taxpayers will face huge tax increases to sustain it or seniors will face savage cuts in Medicare benefits.

There are structural changes and programmatic changes that can significantly improve Senate legislation. These changes could set in motion the dynamics for comprehensive, programmatic reform. Current and future generations of American retirees could benefit enormously.

GIVING NEW RETIREES NEW MEDICARE OPTIONS

In the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, Congress, under a veto threat from President Clinton, enacted an unprecedented restriction on the right of Medicare patients to enter into private agreements with their doctors for medical services. Under the terms of Section 4507 of the BBA, a Medicare patient could henceforth contract privately with a doctor, and the doctor could honor that contract, provided that (a) they sign an affidavit to the effect that he is privately contracting with that patient; (b) the doctor submits that affidavit to the Secretary of HHS within 10 days; and (c) the doctor agrees to remove himself from the Medicare program and refrain from treating all other Medicare patients for a period of two years. Remarkably, Clinton Administration officials and their allies in Congress insisted that this provision was a ""liberalization"" of the right of Medicare patients to enter into private agreements with their physicians for medical services. No similar statutory restriction is found in any other government health care program.

The restrictive Medicare policy embodied in Section 4507 of the Balanced Budget Act resurrected a very similar policy that the Clinton Administration had tried to advance in its failed Health Security Act of 1993. As Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) observed, under Section 1406of that huge bill, the Clinton Administration policy would have restricted the rights not only of senior citizens, but of all patients to enter into a private agreement with their physicians.

Shortly after enactment, the provision became the target of a lawsuit filed by a variety of organizations, but most prominently the United Seniors Association and the National Capital Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The plaintiffs charged that the Medicare policy banning a person from spending his own money on legal medical services was a violation of personal liberty under the Constitution. In a series of decisions, the District Court and the Federal District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia refrained from striking down the provision as unconstitutional and offered limited administrative remedies for the plaintiffs.

Thus, Medicare remains the only government program in which American citizens are barred from spending their own money without restriction on legal medical services. With fewer doctors taking new Medicare patients, the law will have a progressively broader negative impact. Under the terms of the statute, a newly retired senior citizen will be able to engage the services of a favored physician who is no longer taking new Medicare patients if, and only if, that favored physician is willing to give up all of his previous Medicare patients in order to enter into a private agreement with the patient.",heritage.org,news,The Heritage Foundation,Robert E.

NEC confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police to address the myriads of security challenges facing the nation.

Although the names of the governors were not given, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

""I did not submit any memorandum on state police but my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time,"" he said on Friday.

""I did not submit not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

Makinde said the issue of the state police can best be handled by the National Assembly and not the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

Last year, I helped the Welsh government set up a food sustainability toolkit for home cooks and food industry professionals alike. You can access it for free, and it's full of tips to help reduce food waste, packaging and energy use in the kitchen. The website is also a great resource for sustainable Welsh-inspired recipes, including fish-scrap croquettes and today's Glamorgan sausages, which are a great way to use up stale bread. However, I've adapted the traditional recipe to use up not only stale bread but also dark-green leek tops and aquafaba, which acts as a binding agent instead of the usual eggs and milk, so cutting costs and saving waste. Glamorgan sausages are very simple to make and are a great vegetarian option for breakfast or supper; I tend always to make a few extra for the next day.

These fried vegetarian sausages are one of my favourite veggie options for breakfast. I often make a speedy version and don't bother coating them in breadcrumbs, but if you have time and spare breadcrumbs, it is well worth giving your Glamorgan sausages a breadcrumb coating to guarantee a golden crust. To do this, pour about 60ml aquafaba into one bowl and put about 50g breadcrumbs in another. Gently roll a sausage at a time into the aquafaba, shake off any excess, then roll in the breadcrumbs to coat.

Glamorgan sausages are traditionally made with caerphilly, but other cheeses such as cheddar, hard goat's cheese and even mozzarella all work really well, too. The leek tops can also be swapped out for other finely chopped ingredients such as red onions, leafy greens or and other herbs.

Pulse the bread in a food processor to make breadcrumbs. Add the cheese, aquafaba, mustard, leek tops and parsley, then season and pulse again until the mixture comes together into a moist but firm mass that's easy to shape into balls; if need be, add a little extra aquafaba or breadcrumbs to get it to the right consistency. Divide into four balls, then roll each one into a sausage.

Put the oil in a frying pan on a medium-low heat - keep an eye on it to make sure the oil doesn't smoke. Once hot, gently fry the sausages on one side without moving them, until golden brown underneath, then turn and repeat on the other side.",theguardian.com,news,The Guardian,Tom Hunt,0.3647058823529412,448870001,1,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2a57d265d6595899b0163100257d64ff58e207/0_868_2771_1663/master/2771.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c84c2debc4283039d0dc90ecd3f67a3e,

In the past, these transactions were treated as domestic business.

The CMA consists of Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini.

Before, payments between banks in Namibia and nearby countries were treated as if conducted within South Africa.

These transactions would, however, soon be treated as international payments, or Swift (Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) transactions.

This involves a secure messaging network that banks and other financial institutions worldwide use to send information securely and quickly, especially in relation to international transactions.

These new changes come as the Bank of Namibia effected new regulations, changing how electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are handled between Namibia and other countries in the CMA.

In the interim, commercial banks and service providers have already started notifying the transacting public of the new changes.

Most commercial bank clients of First National Bank Namibia and Standard Bank have started receiving short messages about the new regulations.

The same has also seen service providers, including medical aid services, notifying their local clients through formal emails.

Under the bank's determination on the conduct of EFT transactions in the National Payment System (PSD-9), these payments will be treated as international transactions.

Central bank spokesperson Kazembire Zemburuka earlier this week explained the impact of this regulation, saying: ""The bank's regulations don't necessarily require these payments to be routed through the Swift system, which is typically used for international transactions. Banks have some flexibility in how they process these.""

This new regulation will come into effect on 15 April after being issued by the central bank in 2022.

To comply with the new rules and international standards, most banks have chosen to use the SADC-RTGS system, which also relies on Swift.

However, this may cause some delays, as the SADC-RTGS system uses Swift rails, which could slow things down.

Zemburuka said customer service is a priority during this transition.

""We aren't forcing banks to use Swift, we are encouraging them to find ways to keep things smooth for their customers.""

There are no specific guidelines on processing times.

""Banks will set their own internal procedures for handling these payments,"" Zemburuka said.

For specific types of payments, like medical claims, Zemburuka suggested contacting one's bank directly.

""The Bank of Namibia hasn't mandated any specific solutions, so the banks would need to figure this out on their own.""

As these changes take effect, banks and other stakeholders in the CMA would need to adapt to ensure efficient and compliant cross-border transactions.

Nammed, a medical aid fund in Namibia, is also making changes to how its members pay medical bills in South Africa.

These changes are designed to comply with new regulations and improve efficiency.

Members can now choose to settle invoices in South Africa for up to N$10 000.

According to Gert Grobler, the principal officer at Nammed, Swift transfers would be used for larger amounts, which typically takes a few hours to reach South African accounts.

Grobler says it is not Nammed's responsibility to remind healthcare providers to complete Balance of Payment (BOP) forms, and the time frame for receiving funds remains the discretion of the healthcare provider.

To reduce administrative burdens and bank fees, Nammed would also be switching to monthly Swift transfers to South Africa, instead of weekly transfers.

Due to Namibian regulations introduced in 2021, Namibian businesses can no longer receive payments directly from South Africa.

Nammed members with South African bank accounts will be contacted to help them transition their banking details to Namibian accounts.

""We are committed to following Namibian laws and regulations,"" Grobler says.

""We won't use international payment systems that do not comply with Namibian rules. Instead, we're developing a new system for Swift transfers that adheres to local laws.""

According to FNB Namibia payments manager Albert Matongela, clients would need to capture and process payments on the foreign exchange (forex) tab on the existing online banking platform or FNB app when making cross-border payments from FNB to other CMA countries.

He advises clients to delete existing EFT cross-border recipients or beneficiary lists, including EFT folders and EFT bulk payment files.

""Clients would need to re-enter all beneficiaries as global payment recipients, providing details like the beneficiary's bank name, branch name, Swift code, physical address and reason for payment.""

Matongela says global payments can only be made from transactional accounts, not credit cards.

""Additionally, Pay2Cell and scheduled payment functionalities are unavailable for these transactions.""

The SNP leader will be joined by Inverclyde MP Ronnie Cowan and the area's MSP Stuart McMillan. Inverclyde was the one of the last council areas in Scotland to agree to the council tax freeze, with an agreement being reached earlier this week.

Along with Argyll and Bute, the local authority initially sought to defy the Scottish Government's bid to freeze the levy but an agreement was reached earlier this week.

Inverclyde Council leader, Labour's Stephen McCabe, said the decision to go along with the Government's policy was made reluctantly.

McCabe previously pleaded with Michael Gove to fund local authorities directly after the Scottish Government tied funding from Westminster to accepting the freeze.

The policy of maintaining council tax at current levels was made by Yousaf at the SNP conference last October. It led to months of negotiations between the government and councils on how much they should be compensated.

Poverty campaigners have said the freeze offers little to low-income families, but the First Minister has said it will help households with the cost of living.

Ahead of the visit to Inverclyde, Yousaf said: ""In October last year I promised a national council tax freeze for households across Scotland and that is what the SNP is delivering.

""Despite Labour's attempts to stop people in Inverclyde from receiving this support, I am delighted that we are succeeding in delivering it. Council tax bills will be effectively frozen in all 32 local authorities next year.

""Council tax bills in Scotland are already hundreds of pounds a year lower than they are in England and this fully-funded council tax freeze gives people even more relief whilst they grapple with increased costs.""

He added: ""So while Westminster is forcing people to pay the price of broken Brexit Britain and economic mismanagement, the SNP is taking action where we can to protect household budgets.

""In stark contrast to the Tories and Labour Party, the SNP is tackling the cost-of-living crisis, investing in our public services and mitigating against the worst of Westminster's cuts.""",www-tmp.thenational.scot,news,The National,,0.3254901960784313,448869715,1,https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/17358395/,

The former is a given, but taxation has recently become centre stage in political debate. We recently had the highest tax burden since the 1950s.

This in many respects was a direct consequence of the Covid pandemic and the subsequent Ukraine war which had a significant impact on energy prices. Combined, they have cost this country a staggering £500billion. This is money which now has to be added to our national debt and will have to be repaid over time.

Fortunately, the overall finances of the nation have started to improve and in the recent budget, we started to see the tax burden come down from high levels.

Hopefully as the economy continues to recover and grow, there will be further reductions in the tax burden.

However, it has opened up a very important discussion and debate about tax policy itself, what should and should not be taxed, and how we go about doing so.

The Chancellor chose to reduce national insurance. Contrary to some commentary, the national insurance does not specifically pay for pensions, benefits or anything else. It is quite simply a general tax on income and the funds go into the central pot along with all other taxes which then pay for public services.

It is however only applied to income from work. This is the key reason why I have supported the reduction because it will benefit those who are actually in employment (as well as those who are self-employed) which disproportionately should help younger workers.

I believe though that there now needs to be a proper discussion and debate about our tax policies. Sadly, since Nigel Lawson was the Chancellor, subsequent chancellors have all helped to over complicate tax and, in many respects, distort its underlying principles.

A successful tax regime should have four key ingredients. These are:

At the end of the day, a sensible tax framework is there to raise money to pay for public services and other activities which we believe are in the public good.

Ensuring that we have a fair and efficient tax regime is therefore vital.

I for one look forward to a future Nigel Lawson becoming Chancellor and carrying out a long overdue reform of our tax system.",newsandstar.co.uk,news,News & Star,,-0.0980392156862745,448867459,1,https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/resources/images/17851702/,eng-9411982

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",ukiahdailyjournal.com,news,The Ukiah Daily Journal,,0.05882352941176472,448867447,1,https://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

New polling obtained by FOX4 shows a close race as to whether voters will vote yes or no to Question 1 on the April 2 ballot.

If the election were to happen today, 47% said they would vote yes, 46% said they'd vote no, and 7% said they were undecided. The margin of error is +/-4.5%.

Kansas City-based Remington Research Group conducted the poll between March 16 and 17. Of the 506 respondents who answered over the phone or via text, only 3% live in downtown.

Royals predicting huge economic impact for downtown stadium

Those voting yes are agreeing to continuing the 3/8th cent sales tax that goes to both the Royals and Chiefs for another 40 years.

The Royals want to use it to build a new ballpark in the Crossroads while the Chiefs plan to renovate Arrowhead Stadium.

""It's cool for tourism, but then everything's going to be more expensive around the area,"" said Melisa Dunlap of Wyandotte County for how she thinks a downtown ballpark will impact the neighborhood.

Much like what the poll reflected, FOX4 spoke with people who were virtually split on the issue.

""I would vote yes if I could. The reason is simple: where the stadium's at now has been a great place to be, but as for different events, [an outdoor venue] like CPKC Stadium where the Current play would bring a lot more concerts and events to downtown Kansas City,"" said Tom Fulton of Johnson County.

Melisa Dunlap, meanwhile, would vote differently.

""I would vote no simply because of where they're trying to place it. I'm a big fan of the Crossroads,"" she said. ""It would be pretty devastating for those businesses to have to just uproot and move, and on top of that that's going to ruin the area.""

23 March 2024

A 12-month inquiry by CCIWA has recommended Western Australia overturn its ban on uranium mining for export to unlock significant economic benefits for the state.

In the comprehensive examination of WA's uranium industry, CCIWA points to the increasing value of uranium, driven by demand from countries in Asia and Europe who are increasing their investment in nuclear power to help them meet carbon emissions reduction targets.

South Australia currently allows uranium to be mined and exported and the Northern Territory is rapidly expanding its exploration efforts, proving the industry is safe and sustainable.

Last year, South Australia produced around 5,469 tonnes of uranium, worth more than $878 million.

WA has capacity to produce an estimated 8,000 tonnes annually.

CCIWA Chief Economist Aaron Morey said WA's uranium industry could easily exceed $1 billion a

year.

""Uranium spot prices have skyrocketed over the past year or so, largely because of a global shift towards nuclear power in countries like China, France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United States and the UK,"" he said.

""Other states and countries have been able to capitalise on this demand, but WA has missed out - despite having some of the largest uranium deposits in the country.

""Based on current prices, WA has the potential to export around $1 billion worth of uranium each

year, creating around 9,000 direct and indirect jobs in WA,"" he said.

""WA has the technical skills and know-how to reignite the uranium mining industry as well as the

export infrastructure to get it to market.""

Mr Morey said the uranium debate drew strong reactions in the past, but attitudes were changing thanks to advances in technology and an understanding of the role nuclear energy could play in

reducing global emissions.

""The ban on new uranium mines in WA was driven by environmental, health and safety concerns, but these concerns are not significantly different to those faced by any mining operation,"" he said.

""WA is a mining state with a reputation for safety and world's best practice. We have a strong regulatory framework, existing infrastructure and all the skills needed to safely mine and export

uranium.

""Uranium exports are also bound by detailed Commonwealth legislation to ensure they are only used for energy production and not in the development of nuclear weapons.

""If South Australia and the Northern Territory can do it, there's no reason why WA can't.""

Mr Morey said WA is well-positioned to capitalise on the shift towards nuclear power in the Northern hemisphere, where access to renewable energy is more limited than in Australia.

""At the recent COP28 Summit there was a commitment to triple nuclear production, so the demand will continue to be high,"" he said.

""At the same time, uranium supply has been unable to keep pace and supply constraints look set to worsen.""

Mr Morey said allowing uranium mining would simply harness an opportunity to supply WA's

uranium to countries that are already using it.

""If they don't buy uranium from WA, they'll simply buy it elsewhere,"" he said.

""We know uranium can be mined and transported safely because they're doing it in South Australia and the Northern Territory, so it's hard to see why the State Government would want WA to miss out on this economic opportunity.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.2941176470588236,448867334,1,,eng-9409143

The team had also managed to put a nuclear waste product into a British-manufactured self-shielded box and store it securely at Sellafield's Interim Storage Facility.

Zeolites were added to the pond in the 1970s and 1980s to absorb radiation, making the facility safer for personnel.

However, their removal is critical for the clean-up of the pond.

With 236 more of these skips to eliminate, the process represents a quarter of the entire pond clean-up operation.

Carl Carruthers, head of legacy ponds for Sellafield Ltd, said: ""This is a fantastic achievement and a real step forward for us.

""Removing zeolite skips from the pond and transferring them to safer storage reduces risk and hazard on the site.

""It also frees up space in the pond which makes our sludge removal and clean-up work easier.""

The 29 tonne self-shielded boxes that hold the waste are built by Goodwin International, under contract with Westinghouse.

Once waste is placed inside, it's inspected regularly using remote cameras integrated into the box lid.

In the future, the zeolites will be taken from the boxes and encapsulated, then sent to the UK's Geological Disposal Facility.

The First Generation Magnox Storage has been prioritised by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) for clean-up.

NDA group performance assurance director David Redpath said: ""This accomplishment is not only a first for Sellafield, but a world's first for the nuclear industry.

""It is a true testament to the hard work and commitment of all those involved.

""The implementation of this new capability is a key step in reducing the hazard posed by the legacy ponds and demonstrates the strong collaboration between Sellafield and its supply chain.""

Nuclear operations director for Sellafield Ltd, Roddy Miller, said: ""This has been a huge effort involving many different teams at Sellafield.

""It's another iconic moment in our decommissioning journey and follows the start of waste retrievals from our two legacy silos.""",newsandstar.co.uk,news,News & Star,,0.01960784313725483,448867294,1,https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/resources/images/17889603/,

During his maiden address to the nation as flagbearer of the NPP, Dr Bawumia announced that his government would introduce a new friendly tax regime aimed at boosting businesses and making the private sector competitive.

At a stakeholder interaction with members of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Accra, Dr Bawumia underscored the need for a new tax regime to aid his vision of carrying the private sector along, if he becomes President in 2025.

""Our tax system has been the same since independence and it has not helped us so we have to change it,"" he said.

""We are going to have a new tax system. It is going to be a flat tax system to ensure competitiveness and business friendliness. To usher in the new tax regime, there will be tax amnesty for individuals and businesses 2025 under my Government.""

""It will be a clean slate for everyone for us to start afresh,"" said the Vice President, amidst cheers from the business community.

As part of Dr Bawumia's new tax system, he also stated that beginning 2025, under his Presidency, there will be no longer human interface in tax audits.

""We are also going to have a faceless tax audit to prevent harassment of businesses and corruption. And audit of any company cannot be more than once in five years unless there is a reason. This is what other countries are doing,"" he added.

""My vision is to make Ghana one of the most tax competitive countries in the world. I have studied many tax systems and recently, I went to Estonia, which is one of the most digitised and competitive tax countries in the world, to study their tax system. I believe it is possible for us to achieve that in Ghana and even be better.

The NPP Flagbearer also reietreated his pledge to abolish a few taxes as President, including taxes on electronic financial transactions.

""I will abolish certain taxes like the e-levy as I have said, because we want to encourage a cashless system.""

For importers, Dr Bawumia also committed to his pledge of instituting a flat rate for the importation of spare parts as well as benchmarking Ghana's port charges with Togo, to be competitive.

""We can even be lower, to make Ghana the most competitive,"" he assured.

Alhaji Sabiu Bako, Chairman of the Kano Business Community, voiced their collective sentiment, acknowledging their initial support for subsidy removal but highlighting the profound negative repercussions experienced by businessmen in the state. Bako emphasized that the hike in gas prices led to the closure of industries, severely impacting their operations as costs nearly tripled.

Expressing admiration for the President's decisive action in removing subsidies, Bako underscored the need for their earlier submitted blueprint to be given due consideration, hopeful that their concerns would be addressed.

In addition to urging the President to learn from past mistakes in intervention programs, Bako emphasized the necessity of direct assistance to stimulate business growth and mitigate marginalization experienced by the Kano business community.

Former President of Kano Chamber of Commerce, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA), Dalhatu Abubakar, echoed Bako's sentiments, extending well wishes for the government's success in fulfilling its mandates.

(KSNW) -- Haysville city leaders are making a final push to renew a 1% sales tax. The tax has been in place since 2014 and is set to expire in June. City leaders stressed that this is not a new tax, just the continuation of one already in place.

Back in November, the renewal of the tax failed by just a single vote. Haysville's mayor says that this tax provides many benefits for residents.

According to Haysville Mayor Russ Kessler, the current 1% sales tax generates roughly $1.3 million in revenue. It is evenly split between roads as well as parks and recreation. The new version would create an incentive for homeowners.

""Ten percent of the sales tax will go towards property tax reduction, which will help every property owner,"" said Mayor Kessler.

Two Haysville residents who voted ""no"" last November are not sold on the property tax incentive.

""I do believe people are going to turn it down again,"" said Haysville resident Tony Wood.

""We voted it down last November to try to enable it. This time permanently instead of just 10 years, so I'm opposed to it,"" said Haysville resident Mitchell Clothier.

Long-time residents Dawn and George Matthews take their grandchildren to the new parks every week. They say they will vote ""yes"" because if it fails, the financial burden of maintenance will fall on homeowners.

""If it remains a sales tax, everybody gets to participate in paying it. If not, we still have to get the money from somewhere, which means property taxes go up, and then only the property owners are participating in the cost,"" said Dawn.

Haysville City Councilmember Steve Crum says he thinks this year's vote will have a different outcome.

""I think if people really knew what it's done and how it's continued to keep the city nice and moving forward. I think it will pass - it should be able to pass easy if people understand that,"" said Crum.

Ashita Singhal the founder of Paiwand Studios, the winner of this season's 'The Spotlight' tells us about the showcase and what it stood for.

In 'City Blues', we walk through the streets of Delhi, Ashita Singhal and Paiwand Studio's hometown. Drawing an anti-thesis to plastic billboards and urban waste found around the narrow urban alleys and highways, the collection focuses on handlooms and repurposed katrans, the urban waste used as raw material for her designs. It showcases the dualities between consumer culture and sustainability, Paiwand's 'City Blues' pushes the meaning of fabric and design.

With handcrafted textiles at its core, the collection explores contemporary silhouettes through handlooms. Edgy overcoats, vibrant hairdos, and eccentric art pieces walked the two tilted ramps that intertwined each other - a circular stage that mirrors the circular motives of the collection. ""Each aspect of this show was something for us to play with, something for us to dare, something for us to challenge, and define unconventional,"" The designer told us.

A few key pieces including the Jod caught our eye, ""A visual take on our interdependency as city dwellers, our jod piece saw woven kataran binding two models to each other,"" Ashita Singhal elaborated. Similarly, the avant-garde Bamboo bodice and the show-stopping look, a kaleidoscopic silhouette made of multiple waste strips told a strong message through design. ""Each look from the collection derives from the city dweller, the range being a reflection of the diversity a city holds. It is a melting pot of different ideas, techniques, lifestyles and philosophies, each co-existing and playing pivotal roles. Our collection highlights this aspect while toiling around the darker shades that often loom around the urban megastructures."" She added.

Paiwand's ode to the unconventional extended further than just their set design or silhouettes, but also in their choice of showstoppers. ""To us, our weavers are the most important pillars of Paiwand. Kishan Swaroop ji and Brahmjeet ji, master weavers hailing from a small village called Pilakua, bordering Delhi closed the show for us. We shared the 'Spotlight' with these craft geniuses who believed in my vision and dared to weave from a completely unthought-of raw material. The intention is not simply to revive crafts through sustainable materials but to establish weaving with waste as a legacy craft."" Said the designer.

The inspiration behind 'City Blues' stems from my deep-rooted connection to my hometown, Delhi, where I have redefined my perception of mountains, replacing the Himalayas with the Ghazipur landfill. Motivated by a steadfast commitment to diminish textile waste in landfills, I embarked on a sustainable journey, founding Paiwand. The collection, 'City Blues,' delves into my complex relationship with the city, addressing the issues of mass consumerism and herd mentality prevalent in urban cultures.

City blues seek inspiration and also inspire the city dweller. The one who dares to dream in the concrete jungles. The urbane today exists in contrasts, yet stands together when need be. As we draw parallels between textile waste and the narrow urban alleys, our collection gives visibility to those often overlooked in the fashion industry, the artisans behind our couture. Paiwand, through City Blues, stands to redefine how we look at waste and the urbane while providing an alternative to the vicious mundane circularity entrapping the cityscape.

""Paiwand Lagana"" is a local common phrase in India which means to patch or repair. Our label is inspired by the same ideology and is an ode to the bygone culture of valuing rather than discarding. Paiwand sees beauty in bits and fragments, unwanted things in life, and believes in adding value by repurposing those forgotten pieces.

At Paiwand, our commitment to conscious and sustainable fashion goes beyond mere words, it's ingrained in every step of our upcycling process. When textile waste arrives at our workshop, it undergoes a meticulous transformation journey. First, it's carefully sorted, washed, and ironed to prepare it for its new purpose. Then, utilising innovative design techniques, the waste is skillfully cut into strips and joined together, forming the foundation for our unique textiles.

The upcycled fabric strips are then meticulously prepared for weaving, where our talented artisans insert them as weft on the loom, weaving together a new narrative of sustainability and creativity. This intricate process not only breathes new life into discarded materials but embodies our commitment to reducing waste and minimising our environmental footprint.

With constant and dedicated effort over the years, today I have built a supply chain of waste as a raw material and helped transform perspectives towards textile scraps. Paiwand has had a significant environmental impact and crafting consciousness and relevance of circular production models in the design community. Through years of unwavering dedication, I have established a supply chain utilising waste as raw material, catalysing a transformation in perspectives towards textile scraps. Paiwand's significant environmental impact and advocacy for circular production models have reshaped the landscape of the design community. The brand has breathed new life into the Delhi weaving cluster, embracing sustainable production methods rooted in age-old craft techniques. As a craft revivalist, weaver and social entrepreneur at heart, through 'City Blues' I reimagine a sustainable, slow and craft-oriented, urban cityscape.

To us, those threads are katrans, fabric scraps that become our raw material, an integral part of our upcycling. Initially, when the models were tied to the threads, it represented entrapment, the hold that consumerism has on urban society. Throughout the showcase, we had our katrans as a recurring connotation of the potential of scraps and to depict various levels of urbane fraternity.

A set of two tilted orbits heightened at certain angles was a ramp design that was borne out of the need to highlight this idea of circularity. Models going around on these circular orbits were a demonstration of the chokehold consumerism has on urban society. The initial drama, which involved a set of models breaking free of entrapments they were tied to, reestablished the idea of a deliberate effort to break free of herd mentality, to make choices that lead one to an active pursuit of sustainability and not a passive enabler of fast fashion.

The soundtrack of a fashion show is an added space for expression and our music too abides by our recurring themes. The music was a mix of upbeat techno tracks with certain hints of subtlety, highlighting the highs and lows of an urbane setting. A cacophony of the handloom along with the sounds of weavers was layered upon the city sounds; a pious ode to our studio. Based in Noida, right in the middle of an urbane industrial, apparel mass-producing hub, ours is handmade heaved heaven. Like a mirage amid a desert, our studio houses handlooms and is an architectural extension of the Delhi weaving cluster, standing in the middle of export houses all around. Its existence is no less than a marvel and the soundtrack of our show established that effectively.",lifestyleasia.com,news,Lifestyle Asia HK,,-0.01960784313725494,448866420,1,https://images.lifestyleasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/03/22114932/Untitled-design-35.png,

Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), among others, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since 2007 on grants to third parties intended to mitigate homelessness in Washington, federal spending data shows. Despite the nine-figure sum of taxpayer dollars spent, the number of homeless people in Washington grew by about 20% between 2007 and 2023, according to a report produced by HUD.

Washington had the third highest raw increase in its homeless population between 2007 and 2023, according to HUD. California and New York were the first and second highest, respectively.

An estimated 20,036 individuals were living in Washington without permanent shelter as of 2023, according to HUD. Washington's rate of homelessness was among the highest in the nation in 2023.

The federal government has over the years attempted to assist Washington state with its mounting homelessness problem, with little to show for it.

The federal government spent heavily in Washington state during the COVID-19 pandemic, only for the number of homeless individuals in the state to grow by 15.6% between 2020 and 2022, according to HUD.

For instance, the VA has given nearly $120 million to third-party organizations to assist homeless veterans since 2007, much of which was paid out during the pandemic, according to federal spending records. Despite this injection of cash, Washington had the fifth-highest rate of veterans experiencing unsheltered homelessness as of 2023, according to HUD.

Unsheltered homelessness refers to people who primarily spend their nights at ""a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for people,"" according to HUD.

In a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation, a spokesperson for the VA acknowledged that the number of homeless veterans increased in Washington between 2022 and 2023.

In response to the increase, ""VA health care systems covering Washington State (Puget Sound, Spokane, Walla Walla and Portland) housed a combined total of 2,238 homeless Veterans,"" the spokesperson told the DCNF.

""This was possible, in part, due to nearly $15.6 million in grants and contracts awarded to local organizations.""

Some states, like Texas and Florida, reduced their homeless populations during the pandemic, according to HUD. Florida saw homelessness drop by 5.6% and Texas reduced its homeless population by 10.3%.

In addition to growing, Washington's homeless population also lacks access to temporary shelters at higher rates than most the country.

Washington had the ninth-highest rate of homeless people lacking temporary shelter, according to HUD. High rates of unsheltered homelessness in Washington persist despite considerable federal spending aimed at providing them with places to stay.

HUD has spent over $70 million in Washington on its emergency shelter grant program for the homeless since 2007, federal spending records show. HUD spent a further $60 million in Washington implementing its supportive housing program for the homeless.

""In the most recent System Performance Measures, communities across the country have seen reduced lengths of stay in homelessness and low rates of returns to homelessness,"" HUD told the DCNF when asked about its grant spending.

""By and large, the recent rise in homelessness in most communities is more attributable to the rise in the number of people who are becoming newly homeless, than any challenges with system performance.""

Officials have cited rising rents and the end of pandemic-era housing assistance and protections as contributing to the recent rise in homelessness, The Associated Press reported.

Many vulnerable people are living on the streets in Washington, despite federal funds being allocated to provide them with permanent housing.

Washington has a sizable population of young people living on the street, according to HUD. There were 2,026 homeless people under the age of 25 unaccompanied by a parent or guardian in Washington as of 2023.

The number of unaccompanied homeless youths in Washington grew by 12.4% between 2022 and 2023, according to HUD. The Seattle area had the third-highest number of unaccompanied homeless youths in the country in 2023.

Between 2022 and 2023, HUD spent more than $7 million in Washington through its youth homelessness demonstration program, which was intended to alleviate homelessness among young people by providing the population with assistance in acquiring housing or shelter.

Homelessness in Washington is not distributed uniformly across the state.

Roughly half of Washington's homeless reside in the Seattle area, according to HUD. The federal government has, in recent years, targeted the region in an attempt to quell homelessness.

HUD approved over $40 million in funding for the King County Regional Homeless Authority between 2022 and 2023, according to federal spending records. The King County Regional Homeless Authority is an independent government agency that relies on ""data, proven practices, and principles of social justice and racial equity"" to ""significantly decrease homelessness throughout King County,"" according to its website.

""Homelessness disproportionately harms people of color,"" the agency's website reads. ""We use an equity-based decision making framework to proactively dismantle structural racism and advance equity.""

The King County Regional Homeless Authority' total budget was $253.3 million in 2023, according to a document produced by the agency. The Seattle region had the third most homeless people of any area in the United States as of 2023, per HUD.

The influx of migrants and asylum seekers into Washington, rising living costs, a lack of shelter services and the end of pandemic aid are all contributing factors to rising homelessness in the state, University of Washington associate professor Gregg Colburn told the Seattle Times.

Despite recent setbacks, the majority of Seattle residents are optimistic that the city will make progress toward reducing homelessness over the next couple of years, according to a Seattle Times/Suffolk University poll conducted in June 2023.

The King County Regional Homeless Authority and HHS did not immediately respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.

Vitaliy Yuzhilin, esteemed as the progenitor of the National Container Company, has carved a niche as a transformative leader and manager par excellence within the maritime domain. His contributions to the port sector have earned him accolades from industry peers. Presently, the lauded port builder channels his efforts into fostering the growth of innovative IT projects.

Born in Chelyabinsk in 1965, Yuzhilin Vitaliy pursued an academic path that led him to earn a degree in oceanology. Post-graduation, he worked at research institutes that would later become part of the prestigious Academy of Sciences. During this time, the future entrepreneur engaged in extensive marine explorations and participated in deep-sea dives.

It was during these formative years that he began to venture into business endeavors.

In the dawn of the 1990s, transitioning to the Nizhnevartovsk Region in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, known for its rich oil fields and active raw material extraction, Vitaliy Yuzhilin turned his career from selling agricultural products to new business ventures.

Vitaliy Yuzhilin was an integral part of the Nizhnevartovsk Trading House team, focusing on the robust operation of the foreign trade division. His responsibilities included orchestrating the delivery logistics of oil and its derivatives, forging and nurturing sustainable contracts with principal clients and vendors, while also vigilantly tracking the international market's pulse.

Within half a year of the company's inception, Yuzhilin Vitaliy orchestrated the sale and shipment of the initial consignment of hydrocarbon products via tanker. This period also marked his active collaboration with the Ryazan Oil Refinery.

Venturing deeper into logistics, Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich recognized the potential in maritime cargo logistics. He understood the economic advantage of sea transport, with its relatively lower tariffs that decrease operational costs and enhance the competitiveness of enterprises.

Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich recollects that, at the time, the port sector urgently required increased capacity for trading heavy furnace fuel oil, also known as 100-grade fuel oil. The initial task was to identify suitable terminals for the transshipment of oil products and adequate storage facilities.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin moved to the Northern Capital, St. Petersburg, to immerse himself in port operations, soon becoming a shareholder in a stevedoring enterprise. This company had historical significance, occupying spaces where a major maritime hub thrived in the past century.

In his role, Vitaliy Yuzhilin focused on streamlining production and corporate strategies, identifying and implementing priority areas for the company's growth. His insightful leadership resulted in a marked increase in cargo throughput.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin observed that over time, the port continuously evolved to align with contemporary logistics demands. Currently, it stands as a critical node in the trade network of the Northwestern region.

For Vitaliy Yuzhilin, enhancing transshipment procedures and expanding the fleet of handling equipment remain a top priority. The port boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, replete with versatile technology, and extensive warehousing facilities, both open and enclosed.

Moreover, under the guidance of Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich, the stevedoring operation has adopted innovative techniques to refine efficiencies and uphold environmental standards. It maintains strategic partnerships with diverse logistics entities and transport firms to guarantee the proficient and secure movement of merchandise.

Vitaliy Yuzhilin embarked on a significant legislative career as a deputy of the State Duma, a position he first assumed in December 1999. Despite not initially aspiring to a legislative role, his passion for reforming seaport regulations led him to pursue election, representing an electoral district in the Leningrad Region.

His determination stemmed from the maritime industry's pressing need for a stable legal framework aligned with modern demands and the interests of involved economic stakeholders. Yuzhilin Vitaliy advocated for clearly defined roles between port administrations and economic entities, convinced that the lack of clarity was impeding the sector's growth.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin observed that the industry was hamstrung by a patchwork of general industrial laws, government decrees, and ministry orders, which often overlooked the unique aspects of port operations.

He pointed out the stark discrepancy in operational efficiencies, citing that while port machinery could handle a high volume of containers per hour, customs protocols lagged, requiring days to process a single unit's documentation. Deputy Vitaliy Yuzhilin noted the absence of formal mechanisms to engage with state regulatory authorities, an issue he was committed to addressing through his parliamentary work.

During his tenure as a State Duma Deputy, Vitaliy Yuzhilin placed significant emphasis on the need for fair and equitable regulation of tariffs within the port industry to not only maintain but also attract new cargo and clientele. He was instrumental in revitalizing the dialogue on the federal law ""On Seaports,"" ensuring it gained the necessary momentum towards enactment. The law, once in effect, began to define clear criteria and procedures for port construction, location choice, technical equipment specifications, and stringent environmental and safety standards. It also established the regulatory framework for port operations and service provision.

The efforts of Yuzhilin Vitaliy were supported by a substantial collaborative effort from industry stalwarts, fellow deputies aligned with his vision, and a team of skilled legal professionals. Together, they crafted a comprehensive draft for the updated federal law, aligning with the intricate requirements of the maritime industry.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin remembers the meticulous process that went into the development of this legislation, including drafting and revising numerous amendments to its articles. His dedication bore fruit when the law was officially implemented in 2007, coinciding with his re-election to the State Duma. This period marked a significant leap forward for legal standards in the domestic port sector, much attributed to the legislative advocacy of the State Duma deputy.

Within the comprehensive framework of the ""On Seaports"" legislation, the detailed text established an integrated understanding of state regulatory standards. This harmonization of government and business interests in the maritime sector was a primary objective for Vitaliy Yuzhilin during his legislative career. The Deputy was a staunch advocate for the belief that this reformed legislative approach not only elevated the operational efficiency of Russian seaports but also significantly improved their competitive edge on the global stage.

During his tenure as a deputy, Vitaliy Yuzhilin was also involved in initiating and passing amendments to several legislative acts, aiming to modernize aspects like the application of cash registers, which were pivotal for economic progress. His dedication to the nation's fiscal and legislative integrity was evident through his long-standing service on the Committee for Budget and Taxes. His finished his time in the State Duma in 2016, leaving behind a legacy of significant contributions to the legislative frameworks governing the port and taxation systems.

Vitaliy Yuzhilin was a pivotal figure in the evolution of the maritime sector and the advancement of transport infrastructure. As the chairman of the Association of Commercial Seaports (ACSP), he spearheaded numerous key initiatives to strengthen this vital industry.

The ACSP, described by Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin as one of the foremost collectives in the maritime transport field, brings together principal trading ports, research institutions, maritime academies, forwarding agencies, and leading maritime transport enterprises for collaborative endeavors.

At the helm of the ACSP from 2002 to 2022, a tenure spanning two decades, Yuzhilin Vitaliy focused on the representation and protection of the collective interests of all cargo transportation stakeholders within the seaports, emphasizing regulatory and legal governance as foundational to this advocacy.

Through the endeavors of the ACSP under the leadership of Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich, significant legislative changes were achieved, including the exemption of stevedores from water usage fees and the rationalization of the list of hazardous and complex infrastructure facilities within port domains.

Guided by Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich, the Association of Commercial Seaports (ACSP) focused its efforts on the establishment and enhancement of standards in port operations, safety, environmental stewardship, and the adoption of innovative practices within the maritime industry. Under his leadership, several key infrastructure modernization projects came to fruition, including the construction of new terminals and the introduction of modern machinery and equipment.

A champion for ecological preservation, Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich prioritized the reduction of environmental impact from port activities. He advocated for improved environmental protocols for ports and vessels and the integration of eco-friendly technologies.

The ACSP, under the direction of Vitaliy Yuzhilin, regularly organized industry conferences and seminars, creating platforms for the exchange of expertise, fostering business relationships, and encouraging collaborative partnerships within the maritime sector.

In addition, Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich played a pivotal role in the Association's initiatives to expand international economic relations, engaging with global partners, and contributing to the dialogue on maritime transport and trade development projects.

Vitaliy Yuzhilin also made significant contributions to the maritime infrastructure of St. Petersburg with the construction of the Marine Façade passenger port. His legislative input ensured the project met all necessary safety and modern technological standards.

Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich underscores the global significance of the Marine Façade, which has become a prominent cruise and ferry terminal. The port is renowned for its advanced infrastructure, capable of accommodating large vessels exceeding three hundred meters.

The Marine Façade, as highlighted by Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin, stands as a testament to the country's commitment to developing cruise tourism while upholding stringent environmental protocols to mitigate the ecological footprint of port operations.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin was instrumental in the establishment of the Ust-Luga port, which has become the largest in the Baltic and competes internationally. This development has been critical in reducing the country's reliance on ports in the newly independent Baltic states that had previously dictated costs with their pricing and tariff structures.

From its inception, Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich was deeply involved in the Ust-Luga project. Today, the port stands as a modern, multifaceted terminal in the northwest of the country and serves as a model for future transport infrastructure projects.

Yuzhilin Vitaliy, in advocating for the use of IT and automation at Ust-Luga, has addressed the issue of unproductive rolling stock downtime. These technological advancements have been integrated into the loading, unloading, and operation of the port's state-of-the-art equipment.

The port, as developed under the guidance of Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin, now handles a diverse array of cargo types, ranging from hydrocarbons to industrial products, showcasing its comprehensive capability as a multi-profile terminal.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin has diversified his professional interests well beyond the maritime sphere. His involvement with the National Association of Builders (NOSTROY) saw him in the capacity of vice president, where he oversaw a pivotal restructuring phase that broadened the scope of regulatory and oversight functions for self-regulating organizations within the construction industry.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin has continued to engage with the evolving landscape of digital technologies, exploring and evaluating the market for innovative digital solutions.

In addition to his investment pursuits, Yuzhilin Vitaliy dedicates efforts to support environmental initiatives, reflecting his commitment to sustainable development and ecological preservation.

Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin spent his early years in the coastal city of Sevastopol, a relocation from Chelyabinsk during his primary school days.

Pursuing higher education, Yuzhilin Vitaliy Aleksandrovich opted for the Admiral Makarov State Maritime Academy in Leningrad, where he earned his credentials as an engineer specializing in oceanology.

As a youth, Vitaliy Aleksandrovich Yuzhilin excelled in swimming, achieving the rank of Candidate for Master of Sports, a testament to his dedication and skill in the sport. Today, the entrepreneur, known for his strategic work various facets of the port industry, maintains an active lifestyle with regular, extensive walks and indulges in fishing, enjoying the patience and tranquility it offers.",devdiscourse.com,news,Devdiscourse,,0.3098039215686275,448866337,1,https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/23_03_2024_10_32_25_0328769.png?width=920&format=jpeg,

Mar 23, 2024 ExxonMobil, News, Oil & Gas

Kaieteur News - With Guyana's oil spill legislation currently being drafted, Vice President (VP), Bharrat Jagdeo on Thursday disclosed that for the past several months the Government of Guyana (GoG) has been examining how countries deal with issues in relation to oil spills.

Jagdeo, during his weekly press conference, highlighted the examination of global practices in handling oil spill incidents to inform the impending legislation. One such oil spill the Vice President mentioned is lessons learned by the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.

According to reports, on March 24, 1989, an oil tanker owned by ExxonMobil Corporation and dubbed the ""Exxon Valdez"" ran aground in a body of water in the Gulf of Alaska. It was heading to Long Beach, California with over 50 million barrels of oil but had hit a well-known navigation hazard in Alaska's waters. The impact of the collision tore open the ship's hull, causing some 11 million gallons of crude oil to spill into the ecologically sensitive location. At the time, it was the largest single oil spill in U.S. waters. Initial attempts to contain the oil failed, and in the months that followed, the oil slick spread, eventually blackening about 1,300 miles of Alaska's coastline. It was, and still is, regarded as one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history.

On Thursday, Jagdeo outlined the key components of the proposed legislation, including delineating responsibilities, liabilities, and compensation mechanisms in the event of an oil spill.

""So we have been working at this for a while now, looking at how we strengthen legislatively, so we can have clear legislation on how to tackle these things, there is no ambiguity, just in case these things happen,"" the Vice President said.

He underscored the importance of clarity and fairness, stressing the need for independent mechanism to resolve disputes regarding compensation for spills. He noted, ""Often oil companies argue if the government comes up with a figure for compensation...they will argue (for) a different figure. So an independent fair mechanism for all of those things.""

Jagdeo further explained that the Government's aim is to strengthen the law governing any situation in the event of an oil spill.

""We will determine responsibilities both from the states side and from the parties causing the spill, we will determine liabilities in the act who will be liable for what, we would have to have a mechanism that allows us to immediately tackle the consequences of the spill but also a mechanism that could lead to resolution to things like compensation etcetera,"" Jagdeo told reporters.

The Vice President also addressed the complexities surrounding liability in cases involving vessels hired by oil companies, highlighting the gaps in existing regulations. He said the new law will cater for spills that occur during the transport of petroleum products.

Jagdeo said, ""So if a vessel were to have a blowout, of one of these big vessels transporting oil and gas...they may not be associated with Exxon, this is a company that they hire so who is liable in that instance and how to we enforce the liability all of these are questions that we would look at in the legislation.""

The Vice President also noted that there are lots of things that the Government is working on in relation to regulations for the petroleum sector. He reiterated that the oil spill legislation will be laid in the National Assembly before it heads to recess.

Speaking on the Petroleum Commission, Jagdeo said the government is still to decide on the implementation of the independent body. Outside of that, he said the Government has fulfilled its policy agenda for the oil and gas sector, with new things to come on stream.

ExxonMobil Guyana announced the discovery of oil in 2015 and swiftly moved to commence production activities by December 2019. Exxon is the operator of the Stabroek Block with a 45% interest, while Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds 30% interest and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25% interest.

Production from the Stabroek Block developments sits above 600,000 barrels per day (bdp) - with Exxon having the Liza 1, Liza 2 and the Payara projects online. The oil companies have embarked on an aggressive drilling campaign in the Stabroek Block targeting three other developments: Yellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail projects. It should be noted that Yellowtail and Uaru have already been approved, while Whiptail is under review awaiting government approval any day now.",kaieteurnewsonline.com,news,Kaieteur News,,0.05098039215686279,448866120,1,https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/images/2024/03/Jagdeo.jpg,

Abu Dhabi has extended its tax waiver programme for event organisers in a bid to boost its tourism sector.

Event organisers will be exempt from paying the tourism fee of 10% on tickets sold until December 31, 2024, the Department of Culture and Tourism - Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) said on Friday.

""The extension of the tourism fee waiver until the end of the year is part of our efforts to accelerate our growth and provide continued support to our event partners and organisers, who are integral to the tourism and entertainment ecosystem of the emirate,"" said Saleh Mohammed Al Geziry, Director General of Tourism at DCT Abu Dhabi.

The waiver of fees for issuing, distributing and marketing event tickets is one of the several initiatives the UAE capital has introduced to boost its tourism and events industry.

It has reduced the tourism and municipality fees for hotels in the emirate and updated the holiday homes policy to enable farmhouse owners to convert their properties into holiday homes.

Abu Dhabi hosted more than 1,200 MICE events, serving a total of 603,000 visitors in 2022. Visitor numbers reached 18 million, while hotel capacity was at 70% during the same period.

The emirate had set a target of 24 million visitors for 2023.

Individuals and companies must cope with the responsibility of keeping track of their tax liabilities before the fiscal year 2024-2025 ends. As the fiscal year comes to an end, it's critical to assess your tax tactics and make sure you're taking advantage of all available opportunities. One frequently disregarded tax planning strategy is insurance. Individuals and corporations can drastically lower their tax liability while also preserving their financial future by strategically using different insurance rules. This article provides a comprehensive approach to smart tax preparation using insurance.

Review Your Existing Insurance Policies

Take a moment to review your current insurance policies before kickstarting new strategies. Make sure they are in line with your financial aspirations and make any necessary adjustments.

Maximize Health Accounts

Tax benefits for medical costs are provided by Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Contribute to these accounts to experience tax-deductible benefits while covering medical costs.

Usage of Health Insurance Premiums

Don't forget the tax benefits associated with health insurance premiums. Deduct premiums paid for yourself or your employees, maximizing financial savings while ensuring essential coverage.

Inspect Pension and Retirement Plans

Many pension plans come with insurance add-ons that offer tax-deferred growth. Consider these plans, which are not only there to build your retirement savings, but also experience tax advantages along the way.

Long-Term Care Insurance

These expenses can quickly drain funds. Premiums for approved long-term care insurance policies can be deducted, giving you essential coverage while lowering your taxes.

Term Life Insurance

Term life insurance provides affordable protection. Not only are death benefits usually tax-free, but premiums may also be lower, providing peace of mind without hurting the wallet.

Review Beneficiary Designations

Make sure your beneficiary designations are current across all plans. Keeping them up to date might help you avoid tax issues and guarantee that your assets are dispersed how you intend.

Key Person Insurance for Businesses

Businesses can use key person insurance to protect themselves from financial losses caused by the death or incapacity of a key employee. Premiums can be deducted, giving both financial stability and tax advantages.

Consult a professional

Tax laws and insurance restrictions might be complex. Seek counsel from tax specialists or financial consultants to help you negotiate these complexities and optimise your tax plan efficiently.

Start planning early

Finally, do not wait until the last minute to begin tax preparation. Begin early in the fiscal year to maximise tax savings and guarantee you're fully prepared for the coming tax season.

To summarise, insurance may be an effective instrument for decreasing tax liabilities while also guaranteeing your financial future. Individuals and organisations may deliberately reduce their tax obligations by assessing current policies, maximising health savings accounts, investigating retirement plans, and utilising different insurance choices. Consultation with specialists and early preparation are critical for realising the full value of insurance in smart tax planning. Take proactive actions now to decrease your tax obligation and position yourself for financial success in the years to come.

It's boring because auto mechanics and nurses and sales people have to dig around in file drawers and shoe boxes trying to find numbers to fill out government forms. It's terrifying because one mistake, no matter how innocent, can lead to more paperwork, financial penalties or ... the dreaded IRS audit.

Taxpayer dread has increased America's $13.9 billion tax preparation industry. Companies like Intuit, H&R Block and TaxSlayer charge taxpayers a fee to help them pay a bill for something they didn't buy and don't want -- income taxes.

No other bill gets paid this way. Has a plumber or doctor ever sent you a letter demanding you figure out how much you owe them for a new toilet or an appendectomy and then ordered you to send them the money? Or else?

For years, Americans have asked why they must do the IRS's work for them. Instead of paying a third party to figure out the bill, why not have the IRS -- which already has all of the W-2, 1099, etc. information -- set up a system where citizens file their taxes directly?

Now they have.

This month, the IRS launched its Direct File pilot program that allows taxpayers who earned modest amounts and have simple tax bills to skip the third parties and pay directly.

It's a small pilot program covering 12 states: Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Nevada, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. There are income caps for eligible filers and the window for participating in the pilot program is temporary, the IRS says.

It's an idea ""that's at least 25 years late,"" says Richard Kaplan, who teaches tax policy at the University of Illinois College of Law. ""There are about 60 or so countries who've been doing this for quite some time. The IRS has been receiving reports on wages since World War II, and it's been collecting data on capital gains and other income for decades.""

And yet, as modest as this attempt to connect taxpayers directly to the IRS is, well-paid lobbyists for the tax prep industry are trying to kill it.

According to the political transparency website Open Secrets, these companies had spent more than $90 million lobbying against the Direct File program as of last September. Their allies in Congress claim the funding being used for the pilot program was intended for a study and did not authorize an actual program.

""The outcome of the $15 million 'feasibility study' authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act was a foregone conclusion, and taxpayers are rightfully concerned about having the already distrusted IRS function as their tax preparer, filer and auditor,"" said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith of Missouri.

Supporters of the Direct File program respond that consumers are free to continue to pay tax prep services if they choose. While the IRS is hardly perfect, the big tax-prep companies have had their own problems.

Data have been sold to big tech companies, preparers have targeted minority communities, and millions of taxpayers have found themselves falling prey to a giant upsell scheme. An industry born out of need has metastasized into an economic bully, critics say.

""Of course, the paid providers, whether in person or through software, are upset about this because they don't want the competition,"" says Robert Nassau, director of the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic at Syracuse University College of Law. He calls Direct File ""a wonderful idea and a long-overdue improvement to tax administration.""

As for the claims by the Big Tax behemoths that they already offer free services to low-income filers via an arrangement with the IRS, this, too, is a tale of attempting to smother choices for consumers.

Twenty years ago, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies launched the Free File program, pledging to provide services to needy taxpayers via the private sector in exchange for the IRS not launching its own service.

However, multiple investigations found that the companies made the free service web pages extremely hard for consumers to find. And they used the websites to push people toward for-fee products.

In 2022, the Federal Trade Commission announced an administrative action against Intuit for misleading people about free tax filing with TurboTax. In January 2024, the FTC followed up with an order that the company end its deceptive advertising for allegedly ""free"" tax prep services.

There is big money at stake, reports ProPublica. ""In a single year, tax prep companies led by Intuit generated $1 billion in revenue from customers who should have been able to file for free, according to one analysis.""

Direct File is an option for taxpayers this tax season, and while it's a government program, it promotes that most capitalist of ideals: Competition. Having Direct File in the marketplace could lead to lower costs and improved service across the industry.

""I think this will lead to lower pricing for those who use a paid provider,"" Nassau said.

Tax prep companies should stop complaining and start competing.",bostonherald.com,news,Boston Herald,Michael Graham,-0.207843137254902,448865021,1,https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BHR-L-GRAHAM-01.jpg?w=640,eng-9411260

Passing 40-12, House Bill 1015 will accelerate an already-planned income tax cut for individuals.

Passing 34-17, House Bill 1023 will decrease the corporate income tax rate to match the rate for individuals.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp is expected to sign the two measures into law.

Cornelia Republican Sen. Bo Hatchett, a floor leader for Kemp, said, ""We are continuing to conservatively manage our budget and put money back in the hands of Georgians.""

Some Democratic senators voted against each bill.

However, the only lawmaker who spoke against the cuts was Trenton Republican Sen. Colton Moore, who challenged fellow lawmakers to cut personal income tax rates by even more.

""It will be a fraud when you go back home and say, 'I am only cutting the income tax by a tenth of a point,'"" said Moore, who still voted for the measure.

The measure will roll back the personal income tax rate to 5.39 percent, retroactive to January 1.

Currently, Georgia has a flat income tax rate of 5.49 percent, passed under a 2022 law. However, under the new measure, the rate will drop 0.1 percent annually until reaching 4.99 percent if state revenues are maintained.

The corporate income tax had stayed at 5.75 percent, but under the new bill, it will keep falling along with the personal income tax rate until reaching the same minimum rate of 4.99 percent.

Despite the growth in state tax collections slowing, Georgia can afford tax cuts as it budgeted to spend less than the income collected in taxes. The state had US$10.7 billion in unallocated surplus at the end of the previous budget year.",longbeachstar.com,news,Long Beach Star,,-0.1215686274509804,448864714,1,https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cus1711076569430.jpg,eng-9411982

Council bills are sent out by unitary authorities and district councils. They also include precepts for fire brigades, police forces, parish councils and county councils if there is one.

In London and metropolitan areas, there is a precept for bodies such as the Greater London Authority.

Earlier this month, the County Councils Network (CCN) called for an ""honest discussion"" on what services local authorities should be required to deliver after it emerged that councils on average spend two-thirds of their budgets on care services.

At the time, Roger Gough, Conservative leader of Kent County Council and CCN's spokesman for children's services, said: ""This month's Budget confirmed that the public finances remain extremely tight.

""[Large companies] already have systems in place to go beyond what the EPA is requiring, so they're going to sail over these requirements with no trouble,"" Ben Cahill, Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on the sidelines of CERAWeek March 21. ""It's more of a problem for the smaller producers, because many of them are just at the start of their own methane journey and they just don't know what to do about these rules. They haven't sorted through the technology yet.""

The Inflation Reduction Act provided $1.55 billion to give grants and training to smaller companies to help them comply with methane regulations. ""I don't think that money has gotten out the door as fast as people wanted,"" Cahill said. ""A lot of these companies might have some kind of cultural resistance to working with the EPA.""

""The new regulations also took away the grandfathering in of older producing wells,"" Tom Jorden, CEO of Coterra Energy, said in a March 20 panel. Jorden said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the impact on smaller players ""because many of those will not support the kind of retrofitting that companies like ... Coterra can handle. Financially, those wells will just need to be plugged.""

The EPA announced the final rule on methane in December and published it March 8. The rule includes a zero-emissions standard for new controllers, and requirements that routine flaring from new wells be phased out.

A March 15 petition from 24 state attorneys general challenged the rule, which ""imposes expensive and unjustified new technology and monitoring requirements; imposes new storage and transportation requirements; adds new source performance standards; and creates a 'Super Emitter' program that third-party environmental advocacy groups can use to harass producers,"" Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in an accompanying statement.

""Generally, the way things work is EPA gets sued by everybody,"" Cahill said. ""The goal when the EPA puts these things together is to make them as resilient as possible to legal challenges.""

Producers could face hefty charges if they are unable to bring down their methane emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a 0.2% methane emission limit for producers beginning in 2024. It tasked EPA with collecting a Waste Emission Charge for emissions beyond this limit, starting at $900/mt for 2024 emissions and rising to $1,200/mt in 2025 and $1,500/mt in 2026.

Companies producing MiQ-certified natural gas are already meeting the 0.2% threshold, but overall methane emissions from US production are around 1%, Georges Tijbosch the CEO of MiQ, a nonprofit that certifies gas for producers, said March 20. MiQ certifies around 22 Bcf/d of US production and participants include large producers like EQT and Chesapeake.

The EPA is also finalizing rules that will change how companies report their methane emissions, moving away from the old system were they could report modeled emissions. ""That data's wrong. It's too low,"" Cahill said.

""In order to get an accurate estimate of emissions you actually have to go out and measure,"" Matt Watson, EDF's vice president of energy transition, said March 19 at CERAWeek. He praised the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership for helping companies ""get to a really high level, scientifically rigorous measurement.""

When companies in OGMP start the process of measuring in the field, including ""big, sophisticated, well-capitalized companies,"" emissions are often far higher than anticipated, Watson said.",spglobal.com,news,spglobal.com,,0.003921568627450966,448863624,1,,eng-9414921

The unnamed man has raised the alarm over fly-tipping in the alley of Falmouth Street, central Middlesbrough, and has called for a crackdown - saying the estate ""needs CCTV to be put in place to catch the dumpers.""

He claims the issue has caused a problem with rodents and which is causing stress for his mum, a 73-year-old gran and mobility scooter user. Pictures from the alley show dumped mattresses, furniture, and other black bin bags.

He argued that Middlesbrough Council needed ""to do a lot more than what they are doing now"" - and believes issues with pests would decrease ""if tipping was knocked on the head.""

""It puts a lot of stress on her,"" he said. ""She has a mobility scooter and sometimes can't get it out because of rubbish in front of gates. That's why cameras need to be installed.""

Teesside Live understands there have been three fly-tipping reports in the area this year - with council bosses only adding CCTV to areas where the problem is more prolific, due to installation and maintenance costs.

The council says it investigates reports of fly-tipping and will ""prosecute the people responsible when we have enough evidence."" A statement on the council website states: ""Normally we'll remove fly-tipping from land we maintain within 24 hours of getting a report, on a normal working day.""

A council spokesman said: ""Fly-tipping is never tolerated in Middlesbrough. Our environment officers investigate and clean up hundreds of incidents of dumping every month, prosecuting where we can. We continue to encourage members of the public to report incidents either online or by calling 01642 726001.""

You may save some more tax even at the last moment.

Save More Tax Before Submitting Investment Proof: Do you also have to submit investment proof in your office within the next few days? If after collecting all the documents, you come to know that this time there is some shortcoming in your investment, due to which there is a possibility of more tax being deducted, then what will you do? If something similar is happening to you, then read the things mentioned here carefully before submitting the investment proof. You may still have scope to save some tax under the Income Tax Rules.

Talking to Outlook Money, Amarpal S. Chadha, Tax Partner and Mobility Leader, EY India said, ""Wise investments help in tax saving. Understanding the wide range of tax-saving investments/expenses eligible for tax deductions can help to reduce tax liability. From the financial year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default tax regime, which has limited deductions/exemptions but lower income-tax slab rates. If one opts for the old regime and if you have not yet made necessary tax savings investments/incurred eligible expenses, time is running out, as 31st March is fast approaching to make necessary investments/incur eligible expenses under section 80C (deduction up to 1.5 lakhs) and various other sections to minimise your tax liability. One can consider avenues like investment in the Public Provident Fund, Equity linked savings scheme, National Pension Scheme, Health insurance policy, 5-year bank fixed deposits, etc. Similarly, there are various expenses which are eligible for tax benefits like children's tuition fees, housing loan principal repayment, etc.""

Bankbazaar.com's CEO Adhil Shetty said, ""Tax deductions under various sections of the Income Tax Act can unlock significant savings for you. From Section 80C offering deductions of up to 1.5 lakh on principal repayment to Section 24(b) granting tax exemption on home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh per annum, there are ample opportunities to optimize tax liabilities. Moreover, those embarking on property construction journeys can benefit from Section 24(b) if the construction is completed within five years.""

""Additionally, health insurance premium payments can be leveraged for tax deductions under Section 80D, offering further relief. Investing in instruments like SCSS, SSY, NPS, and PPF not only secures financial futures but also qualifies for tax waivers under Section 80C. Furthermore, Section 10(10D) ensures tax-free proceeds from insurance policies. With provisions like Section 80EE enabling deductions on home loan interest exceeding the Section 24 limit and the extension of additional interest eligibility under Section 80EEA for affordable housing, you have ample opportunities to optimise your tax planning. When it comes to documents, ensure all documents are self-attested, with signatures aligned with PAN records. Digital proofs must contain essential details like investor name, PAN, and portfolio value. Physical documents, such as bank FDs, should highlight maturity details. Mutual funds investment receipts should be kept safely for the current financial year to claim deductions. Proof amounts must precisely match claimed deductions. Maintain a file, including purchase invoices and statements, to avoid delay in your tax submission,"" Shetty added further.

Ashish Aggarwal, Director of Acube Ventures told Outlook Money that the first thing to do is to analyze your current eligible investments for the sections that include sections 80C, 80D for health insurance premium payment 80E for education loans and more among others. Some people of low-income status are exploited by the provisions made to them. ""As you near the end of the financial year, looking for ways to save more on your tax is very important. The investments made are a good start, but not all. You can use some strategies to decrease the taxable income,"" he said.

""Look for charitable organizations which offer two kinds of donations namely charitable donations which fall under section 80G and other funds approved under section 80GGA. Modest compulsory works can establish a worthwhile allowance that will lower the amount of income that is taxable. While there are tax return benefits of being a business owner or a professional, don't forget to claim genuine business expenses. Not only can the quotations of renting a workplace but also the internet and a little part of car maintenance - all such deductible net incomes challenge the small shareholders to the tax policy. To sum up, if you had losses related to capital gains, you could use them to offset the gains to secure the best position. Also, one can make a strategic loss carry forward to be used against the gained income from the future financial year,"" Aggarwal added further.",business.outlookindia.com,news,Outlook,,0.192156862745098,448863087,1,https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness%2Fimport%2Foutlookmoney%2Fpublic%2Fuploads%2Farticle%2Fgallery%2F7af14f763482e90f3751fee726ba14ca.gif?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,eng-9410396

Some floating plastic waste stretched several hundred meters long, so he could not swim in the bay, he said.

Patricia Mayerhofer, an Australian tourist, visiting Ha Long Bay from Feb. 20 to 23, said that the world heritage site looked like a ""sea of trash.""

She was told by tour operators that the trash came from fishing villages or was dumped by tourists.

""I see that Vietnam doesn't really care about environmental issues,"" she said.

Ged Kelly, a British tourist, shared a similar experience. While kayaking for 20 minutes on the afternoon of March 4, Kelly saw ""countless plastic bottles, cans, gloves, even an office chair floating on the water.""

More plastic waste tends to appear in Ha Long- Cat Ba Island area, famous for cruise tours and kayak activities, from September to May, coinciding with the international tourism season.

The management board of Ha Long Bay said in early March that floating trash was mainly scattered in Trong Mai, Me Cung, Sung Sot, and the Luon Caves.

Due to the foggy, humid, and windless weather, trash and foam float from the foothills, rocks, and banks.

Since the end of February, sanitation workers have been collecting waste from early morning to 5 p.m., averaging about 10-12 blocks of trash per day.

In early March, the management board mobilized nearly 20 ships, boats, and ferries to collect floating trash to shore for processing.

It will continue to strengthen inspection and supervision and handle violations of waste and wastewater management and environmental protection in Ha Long Bay.

However, Hoang Minh, owner of the cruise ship that Brauwalder rented, said the garbage problem in Ha Long Bay and Cat Ba ""has persisted for many years,"" even though there have been garbage cleanups.

Nguyen Duy Phu, chairman of Lan Ha Cruise Association, said tourists would not accept any appeasement from boat owners regarding the issue.

No matter how good the service is, the tourists still give zero satisfaction points because the bay was full of trash, Phu added.

To limit the bad experiences of foreign tourists, his association has hired its own boats to clean up the trash three times since last year.

Fodor's Travel magazine recently included Ha Long Bay in its annual list of destinations tourists should re-consider traveling to due to its trash problem.

Brauwalder said it was necessary to strictly deal with the source of plastic waste in Ha Long Bay and Cat Ba Island and international tourists like him are willing to pay more to support efforts to clean up the heritage area.

But a bunch of angry, over-taxed and under-protected local business people there have said, ""Enough is enough.""

The owner of a restaurant has called on other Oakland small businesses to stop paying local taxes until their city starts doing what it should be doing - protecting them from a recent wave of robberies and thefts.

Big businesses like Tesla or Oracle can escape the madness and high taxes in California by moving to Texas, and they have.

But the poor guy who runs a pizza shop, gas station or a bar in Oakland or Los Angeles is trapped in a city while civilization and law and order have been breaking down around them.

Thanks to the bias and dishonesty of the TV networks and mainstream media, at least half the country has no idea just how bad things have gotten in West Coast cities like Oakland, Portland and Seattle.

Only Fox will regularly show their sidewalks lined for blocks with tents and strewn with used needles and human feces. Only Fox covers the financial strain tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are placing on their finances and police forces.

The ideologically perverse people in charge of our big cities in California and elsewhere have forgotten that the first job of any government is to protect us from being harmed by bad people who'd hurt us or take our stuff.

Democratic governments like the one in New York City are spending more time and money protecting and helping the people who are here illegally than they are on their own citizens.

They're protecting squatters and homeless people living on sidewalks, not the homes and businesses of taxpayers.

In New York, while their city is going broke paying for food, hotel rooms and welfare benefits for their illegal ""visitors,"" government officials have kicked kids out of schools to make room for illegal immigrants.

Meanwhile, New York's politicians and government attorneys are so evil, it will not surprise me if someday they try to seize Trump Tower and turn it into the Migrant Tower.

The tax revolt of small businesses in Oakland is only a spark so far, but it could become a ray of hope for people living in our battered cities.

If a few million other businesses and taxpayers catch the Oaklanders' Tea Party spirit, the people in charge might get the message and the upside-down world we've been living in for the last five years might be turned right-side up again.

Shoplifters might be arrested and imprisoned for more than four hours again. Sidewalks might be cleared of homeless encampments again.

Police might be adequately funded and deployed again. People might even be able to get the cops to arrest squatters who have taken over their homes again.

Daylight carjackings and home robberies might be reduced dramatically and women might feel safe to go to the mall again without worrying that their jewelry or smart phones will be swiped.

Oakland's talk of a tax revolt is an insurrection that might never spread to other cities in California and elsewhere.

But it's an encouraging sign that the harmful ""woke progressive policies"" liberal Democrats have put into place in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Seattle may not last much longer.",townhall.com,news,Townhall,Michael Reagan,-0.2784313725490196,448862766,1,https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/83/5a95419d-7d39-4a31-ae01-7c98cec8c971.jpg,

The observation was made by a division bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta while providing detailed reasons for its findings a day after it declined to stay the recent appointment of retired IAS officers Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu as election commissioners.

""Suspension of legislation pending consideration is an exception and not the rule,"" the Supreme Court observed,"" the bench noted, as per news agency PTI. The bench, however, expressed concern on the procedure adopted for the selection of ECs, including the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), and said that such selection should be made with full details and particulars of the candidates circulated among all members of the selection panel.

""Procedural sanctity of the selection process requires a fair deliberation with the examination of the background and merits of the candidate. The sanctity of the process should not be affected. Nevertheless, in spite of the said shortcoming, we do not deem it appropriate at this stage, keeping in view the timelines for the upcoming 18th general election for the Lok Sabha, to pass any interim order or direction.

The petitions, in a wider sense, opposed the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023 faces from critics. Dissenters argue that the legislation dropped the Chief Justice of India from the selection panel.

The law mandates the constitution of a selection panel comprising the prime minister, the leader of the largest Opposition party in Parliament, and a union minister nominated by the prime minister for the purpose of selection of election commissioners.

Earlier, on January 12, the SC bench comprising Justice Khanna and Justice Datta had declined to order a stay on the implementation of the law, which dropped Chief Justice of India (CJI) from the panel for the appointment of election commissioners.

The petitioners had alleged that the Act excludes the CJI from the process of appointment of the members of Election Commssion of India (ECI) and was in violation of the March 2023 verdict of the top court which had ordered that the appointment of members of the EC be done on the advice of a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the CJI and the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha till a law is made by the Parliament.",english.jagran.com,news,Jagran English,,0.07450980392156858,448862484,1,https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/03/23/article/image/SC-1711165498286.jpg,eng-9413288

This move also marks the first test case of the ruling party's political will to expand the narrow tax base.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) issued the statutory regulatory order to implement the new scheme from April 1, 2024. With the issuance of this notification, Pakistan has fulfilled a condition set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of the board meeting to approve the $1.1 billion final loan tranche.

Stakeholders have been given seven days to provide suggestions and raise objections to the draft of the scheme, named ""Special Procedures for Small Traders and Shopkeepers."" However, the scheme's scope has been expanded to include dealers, retailers, manufacturer-cum-retailers, importer-cum-retailers, or any person involved in the supply chain of goods.

This scheme is announced for Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Quetta, and Peshawar, which are major trade hubs in Pakistan.

Previous attempts to bring traders into the tax net have been unsuccessful, including compulsory door-to-door registration during General Pervez Musharraf's martial law period. Even the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) too holds a soft corner for traders and has backed off from similar attempts, including one in 2015.

During the first eight months of this fiscal year, retailers paid a mere Rs11.2 billion in income tax compared to the Rs217 billion paid by the salaried class.

Read KPRA asks TMAs for tax registration

This time, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) will monitor the progress of the compulsory registration scheme for retailers.

Details show that the salaried class remained the fourth-largest income tax contributor during the first eight months of the current fiscal year. The additional tax paid by the salaried class slightly exceeded the total tax of Rs61.3 billion paid by wealthy exporters.

According to the FBR notification, the scheme will apply to traders and shopkeepers operating through a fixed place of business, including stores, shops, warehouses, offices, or similar physical locations within the territorial civil limits, including cantonments, in the six cities.

The scheme is launched for registration and payment of minimum advance income tax, effective from April 1st. However, traders will make their first tax payments on July 15th, according to the notification.

Traders and wholesalers have been given one month by the FBR, expiring on April 30th, to register. Failure to register will result in forced registration by the FBR in its National Business Registry.

A central repository database of traders and shopkeepers will be accessible through a Tajir Dost module tax application or the FBR's portal for registration and advance income tax payment.

Every trader is liable to pay monthly advance tax on the 15th of each month. Even if a trader's income is below the income tax threshold, they must pay a minimum of Rs1,200 per annum income tax.

The FBR also announced a 25% tax incentive for traders who pay their full tax in advance before the due date or file income tax returns for the tax year 2023.

Tax returns for the tax year 2023 remained low at 4.2 million, compared to 5.9 million in the preceding year.

Traders will pay tax through a separate computerised payment receipt against the payment slip ID. The tax will be calculated based on the trader's annual rental value, which is 10% of the fair market value of the business premises. This includes all business places, stores, warehouses, and any other offices.

According to FBR statistics, over 80% of bank accounts are not visible to FBR authorities, many of which are operated by these traders.

The fair market value will be calculated based on the valuation of immovable properties notified by the FBR. In cases where such valuations are unavailable, the district officer's valuation will serve as the benchmark.",tribune.com.pk,news,The Express Tribune,,0.08235294117647052,448860754,1,https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/11711140354-0/11711140354-0.jpg,eng-9411982

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai'i) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) today reintroduced the State Public Option Act, bicameral legislation to create a Medicaid-based public health insurance option by providing Americans with a new high-quality, low-cost choice when purchasing health insurance.

""Even with all of the progress we've made in recent years to expand access to health care and make it more affordable, many Americans still lack coverage,"" said Senator Schatz. ""By opening up state Medicaid programs to everyone regardless of income, our bill will help close the coverage gap and provide every American with a high-quality, low-cost insurance option.""

""For communities to thrive, Americans need access to quality, affordable health care,"" said Senator Luján. ""A state public option puts us one step closer to universal coverage for all Americans. That's why I'm proud to re-introduce this legislation that would bolster our health care system and ensure more New Mexicans have access to life-saving care.""

The State Public Option Act will allow states to create a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents regardless of income, giving everyone the option to enroll in a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan. State public option programs have been shown to lower costs, increase consumers' choice in plans, and improve equity in coverage. Several states - including Maine, Minnesota, and New Mexico - are currently exploring creating a Medicaid buy-in option.

Despite the progress made under the Affordable Care Act, which passed 14 years ago this week and has brought the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low, nearly 26 million of Americans still lack coverage. This legislation will help workers who do not have employer-sponsored coverage but may make too much to qualify for subsidies under the ACA get affordable insurance. It will also help consumers who live in counties with limited insurance carriers and worry about the lack of options for affordable coverage. Additionally, in the face of sweeping Republican attacks on reproductive freedom across the country, the bill requires states to cover sexual and reproductive health services, including abortion care, in all of their Medicaid buy-in plans.

Medicaid is a popular and cost-effective program with a large provider network. The program has the same positive ratings as private insurance, but provides health coverage at a much lower cost. Based on partnerships between state and federal governments, Medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.

In the Senate, the Schatz-Luján legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mazie K.

According to the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV)'s Payment Department, Việt Nam has a total of more than 145 million cards in circulation, of which 113.07 million are domestic cards and 32.81 million are international cards. However, many of the cards are not being used. It is estimated some 55 million are junk cards.

The number of 'junk cards' is significant as the race to issue cards among banks has been very fierce.

One woman in Hà Nội admitted that she did not remember how many cards she had activated, but now she only used two cards and accounts.

All banks have tried to increase market share of credit cards as investment in this segment brings big profits because interest rates are higher than regular loans. Card fees, such as annual fees, cash withdrawal fees and overdue debt fines, bring a large and very stable source of revenue for banks.

Banks have rushed to issue cards to expand market share, regardless of whether customers need to use them or not. Banks have continuously offered preferential policies to attract and retain customers to use credit cards, such as cashback at shopping locations, cash rewards for high spending, free suitcases and exemption from annual fees for customers in the following year if their spending reaches the required levels.

Meanwhile, customers do not hesitate to activate cards as this can be done online easily. This is one of the reasons for banks' rampant card issue, which has caused waste and many other consequences.

Phạm Anh Tuấn, Director of the SBV's Payment Department, admitted that in recent times, many banks had been quite easy going in activating credit cards.

Despite the indiscriminate junk cards, there is currently no legal regulation to cancel cards that are not being used.

Currently, each bank has its own regulations on handling junk cards. At Agribank, an account and card, which does not have enough minimum balance of VNĐ50,000 for individual customer and VNĐ1 million for institutional customer, and inactive within 12 months, will be put into sleeping account mode. Then, Agribank will close the account and card if the account and card is still inactive in the next 36 months.

However, banks can only close accounts and cards with a balance of zero đồng. For accounts that still have even VNĐ1, banks cannot close. In fact, there are many such accounts.

Therefore, industry insiders proposed the management authorities should issue legal regulations on closing junk cards. -- VNS",vietnamnews.vn,news,vietnamnews.vn,,0.2862745098039217,448859941,1,https://image.vietnamnews.vn/uploadvnnews/Article/2024/3/22/338375_card.jpg,eng-9419527

(KSNW) -- Haysville city leaders are making a final push to renew a 1% sales tax. The tax has been in place since 2014 and is set to expire in June. City leaders stressed that this is not a new tax, just the continuation of one already in place.

Back in November, the renewal of the tax failed by just a single vote. Haysville's mayor says that this tax provides many benefits for residents.

According to Haysville Mayor Russ Kessler, the current 1% sales tax generates roughly $1.3 million in revenue. It is evenly split between roads as well as parks and recreation. The new version would create an incentive for homeowners.

""Ten percent of the sales tax will go towards property tax reduction, which will help every property owner,"" said Mayor Kessler.

Two Haysville residents who voted ""no"" last November are not sold on the property tax incentive.

""I do believe people are going to turn it down again,"" said Haysville resident Tony Wood.

""We voted it down last November to try to enable it. This time permanently instead of just 10 years, so I'm opposed to it,"" said Haysville resident Mitchell Clothier.

Long-time residents Dawn and George Matthews take their grandchildren to the new parks every week. They say they will vote ""yes"" because if it fails, the financial burden of maintenance will fall on homeowners.

""If it remains a sales tax, everybody gets to participate in paying it. If not, we still have to get the money from somewhere, which means property taxes go up, and then only the property owners are participating in the cost,"" said Dawn.

The SWIFR Grant Program is a covered program under the Justice40 Initiative which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged communities.

The tribe has been working with officials at the city of Brewton, Alabama for several years to grow a healthy relationship for both environmental education and active recycling efforts. ""This valuable investment will give us the opportunity to continue to improve waste material management in our communities, and greatly enhance our recycling abilities,"" said Yank Lovelace, Mayor of Brewton.

""Through this grant, we will be able to conduct a recycling feasibility and sustainability study to make improvements needed, provide education and outreach, as well as increase community recycling by providing more community recycling containers,"" Kristi Weatherford, Poarch Band of Creek Indians Director of Environmental Programs said. ""We are excited to continue our work with local partners like the City of Brewton, in growing a healthy relationship for both environmental education and active recycling efforts.""

The partnership between the Poarch Band of Creek Indians and the City of Brewton has been key for growing environmental efforts in the rural portion of the state and has been identified as a successful model for other small towns to follow. While other cities may be abandoning their recycling efforts, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians are looking to expand both availability to the public, and a growing list of recyclables.

Currently, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Recycling program, located at 4447 Hwy 21 South, Atmore, AL, accepts a variety of materials from the community including, paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, as well as electronics, appliances, light bulbs, household batteries, ink cartridges, and toner.

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians hosts an annual Household Hazardous Waste and Electronic Recycling Event annually for the entire community, which is scheduled for April 27, 2024.

These changes, which coincide with the start of the new financial year, will affect things like National Insurance, wages, benefits, and pensions, reports Wales Online.

Many regular payments will see an increase, particularly for the most vulnerable households. New employment and tax laws will also come into effect, impacting areas such as wages and car tax.

Here's a breakdown of all the changes coming in April and how they might affect you.

National living wage and minimum wage increase

From April 1, both the national living wage - the wage rate paid to most UK workers and the minimum wage for younger workers will increase. The national living wage currently stands at £10.42 per hour for workers aged over 23, but in April 2024 it will rise to £11.44.

This new figure will also apply to 21 and 22-year-olds for the first time, equating to an annual pay rise of £1,800, according to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.

The national minimum wage for 18 to 20-year-olds is set to increase by £1.11, making it £8.60 per hour. Apprentices and 16 and 17-year-olds will also see a rise in their minimum hourly rates from £5.28 to £6.40.

Car tax changes

From April 1, changes to car tax will affect petrol, diesel, and hybrid drivers. Vehicle excise duty (VED) is going up, which could mean some drivers will have to pay hundreds of pounds more.

The fees will rise in line with the retail price index (RPI) inflation. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said that rates ""will remain unchanged in real terms"" but the changes will ""impact"" vehicle owners. The amount you pay in VED is mostly based on how much pollution your car produces. This means people with petrol and diesel cars that pollute more will be most affected.

Cars that emit more than 255g/km will have to pay an extra £140 in their first-year tax, making the total bill £2,745. Cars that were first registered on or after March 1, 2001, are grouped according to how much they pollute.

If your car is in the top band M group, you'll have to pay £40 more with the annual amount going from £695 to £735. If your car falls into band L, you'll have to pay an extra £35. Cars in bands K and J will see a rise of £20.

Even cars that don't pollute as much will see a price increase, but it won't be as high. Cars with larger engines (over 1549cc) registered before March 1, 2001, will face an additional £20 charge. If your car's engine is smaller than 1549cc, you'll only have to pay £10 more.

You won't have to pay any VED rates if you drive a fully electric car, but this might change in April 2025.

TV licence increase

The annual cost of a TV licence is going up from £159 a year to £169.50 from April 1. This fee is required if you watch or record live TV programmes on any channel on a TV, PC, laptop, tablet, or phone.

Not paying it is a criminal offence and you could be fined £1,000 if you're found not to be paying for one when you should be.

You also need to pay for a TV licence if you use BBC iPlayer, even if you only watch shows on catch-up. However, you don't need to pay if you're only watching back things on Netflix, Amazon Prime, ITVX, Disney Plus, YouTube, All 4, or My5.

The rules are different if you're watching live shows through these services, in which case you do need a TV licence.

National Insurance cut

From April 6, National Insurance (NI) will be reduced by 2p, as previously announced by Mr Hunt. National Insurance is a tax on your earnings if you're employed or on your profits if you're self-employed.

Starting from April 6, the initial rate for National Insurance will fall from 10% to 8% for 27 million workers. The chancellor says this will be worth about £450 a year to an employee earning an average salary of £35,000.

The chancellor is also reducing National Insurance for approximately two million self-employed workers, who will see their rate drop from 8% to 6%.

However, any reductions in NI are likely to be significantly offset by existing policies that have frozen income tax and National Insurance thresholds the levels at which people start paying these taxes at £12,570. National Insurance thresholds used to increase annually, typically in line with inflation, but they are now frozen at their current levels for another four years until April 2028.

More people are being nudged into earning enough to start paying National Insurance (NI) and moving into higher tax brackets. This is particularly true as wages are set to rise in the coming weeks.

The Resolution Foundation think tank's analysis suggests that only those earning between £27,000 and £59,000 will be better off after the 2p cut comes in. This means millions of people earning below and above these salaries will still be worse off after the announcement.

State pension increase

From April 8, the state pension will increase by 8.5%, in line with the triple lock. This ensures pensioners' income rises in line with whichever is highest out of average earnings growth, inflation, or 2.5% per year.

The 8.5% figure is based on the September earnings growth figure and was confirmed by Mr Hunt in his autumn statement last year.

The new weekly rates will be as follows:

Full new state pension: rising to £221.20 from £203.85 (an increase of £17.35 per week) Old or basic state pension: rising to £169.50 from £156.20 (an increase of £13.30 per week) Rise in state benefits

Millions of people are set to see an increase in their benefit payments in the coming weeks. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has confirmed that state benefits will rise by 6.7% from April 8.

This figure is in line with the consumer prices index (CPI) inflation rate in September 2023.

The increase will affect nearly all benefits, including universal credit, which is claimed by over 200,000 people in Wales, PIP, ESA, DLA, income support, and pension credit. You can check out all the new rates from April 2024 here, but it's worth noting that due to the way many benefits are paid each month, you might not see the full new rates reflected in your payments until a few weeks after April 8.

Around six million people in the UK claim universal credit, which is given to people on low incomes who are working or those who are out of work. State benefit rates change every year and 2024 will see most of them increase by 6.7%.

New flexible working rules

From April, employees will be allowed to request flexible working from their employer from day one of their job. Currently, those who have worked for their employer for 26 weeks or more have the right to ask if they can work flexibly.

But a new change in the law will make this a right that applies from the first day of employment.

A bill that strengthens employment rights for new mothers and mothers-to-be will also come in from April. The new law will protect them against redundancy for longer during and after pregnancy or after periods of maternity, adoption, or shared parental material.

From April, the Carer's Leave Act will give unpaid carers the right to take additional unpaid leave from work to help balance caring responsibilities.",cambridge-news.co.uk,news,Cambridge News Online,Niamh Dann,0.1372549019607843,448859454,1,https://i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article21728439.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_JS96933442.jpg,eng-9410594

With their help, you can save money on taxes both as you earn and as you draw on your retirement funds later in life.

(firmenpresse) - If your retirement plan just consists of your 401(k) and maybe home ownership, Goldstone Financial Group wants you to know there is so much else you can be doing, including reducing your tax burden. And, let's be honest, who doesn't want to pay less tax?

Say goodbye to hefty tax bills and hello to a better retirement plan at https://goldstonefinancialgroup.com/

The Importance Of Pre-Retirement Tax PlanningGoldstone Financial Group wants you to know that an essential part of retirement planning is not only saving and investing for it but reducing both your current and future taxable income and tax burden.

That's why they are now focusing on pre-retirement tax planning.

As a recent article on Forbes by the Forbes Financial Council explained, in 2024, when it comes to financial planning, taxes should come first. With income and other taxes tipped to rise significantly in the coming years, Forbes argued that strategies like putting more money into a Roth account that offers tax-free growth and withdrawals will continue to have a much greater impact on your financial future, and Goldstone agrees.

Pay Less Tax Now & In RetirementGoldstone has been tracking the same evolutions in the taxation landscape, and they believe you need to think about your retirement beyond just what you can save or invest. As their spokesperson said concisely, ""Remember, it's not only what you make but what you keep.""

As such, Goldstone Financial Group will develop a personalized retirement plan for you that integrates tax-minimizing strategies like using Roth IRAs. These smart tax strategies are designed to reduce your taxable income now as you are earning money and to reduce the future tax levied against your savings when you start drawing on these funds in retirement.

The financial planners' spokesperson added, ""As you approach retirement, it's important to plan for how you will manage your income and taxes to ensure you have enough to support your lifestyle while minimizing your tax bill.""

Tax Planning, The Cornerstone Of Good Retirement PlanningAs Forbes' report on the necessity of pre-retirement tax planning also explained, the prevalence of the 401(k) means that you may now think this is all that is required for you to enjoy a comfortable financial future, but as Goldstone also stresses, it is not the case.

That's why they have built tax planning into their expanded retirement advisory service - they believe the smart taxation choices you make today will continue to pay dividends long into the future.

Goldstone Financial Group has offices in Nashville, Franklin, and across Tennessee. They are an accredited fiduciary advisor that is committed to the values of financial trust, honesty, and transparency.

You can pay less tax today, tomorrow, and every day of your retirement, thanks to Goldstone.

He said this while delivering his speech at GNCCI's Dialogue with Vice President Dr. Bawumia, on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, at Best Western Hotel.

He indicated that the best way to realize the country's goals in its tax administration is to digitalize the system.

""The Chamber acknowledges government's effort, led primarily by His Excellency the Vice President towards championing a new era of a digitalized Ghana. An era where registration, documentation, payments, revenue collection, public consultations, citizens identification, among other key business activities are made easier and faster leveraging the power of digital technologies"" he noted.

He further posited that the move has contributed to a decline in corruption and a significant reduction in institutional bureaucracy.

He said the efforts by the government have led to sustainable economic growth and development, especially during the period COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Randy Feenstra (R-Hull) led a letter to President Biden opposing his proposed tax hikes on family farms and small businesses.

""President Biden's $7.3-trillion budget for Fiscal Year 2025 proposes tax hikes that would crush our family farms and small businesses. This bloated budget includes a new tax on the transfer of agricultural and business assets, a devastating cap on like-kind exchanges, and a combined capital gains and dividend tax rate more than double that of China. These economic policies will stifle economic growth in our rural communities, prevent young producers and entrepreneurs from continuing the family tradition, and sadly give family farms and small businesses no other choice but to close for good,"" said Rep. Feenstra. ""That's why, in response to President Biden's reckless budget, I led a letter to the White House urging the President to abandon these crippling tax hikes on the backbone of our economy - our nation's farmers and small business owners. To grow our economy, we must end wasteful government spending, balance our budget, and keep taxes low for our farmers, producers, business owners, and innovators.""

In opening their letter, the lawmakers explained that ""We write today on behalf of Americans across this nation that own and operate small businesses and family farms, and the employees and customers they serve. Since the founding of this nation, America's farmers and small businesses have been the backbone of our economy. Unfortunately, revenue proposals outlined in your FY2025 Budget Request will significantly burden these hardworking Americans. This is the third year in a row in which your Administration has sought to fuel its reckless spending agenda on the backs of family farms and small businesses.""

""In January, the Death Tax Repeal Act was introduced in the House of Representatives with 161 original cosponsors, recognizing both the economic damage the Death Tax causes and the simple fact that treating death as a taxable event is inherently wrong. In contrast, your budget proposals related to like-kind exchanges, stepped-up basis, capitals gains, and estate taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes on the backs of America's farmers and small businesses to help pay your massive $7.3 trillion dollar budget. By proposing this transfer tax and letting the enhanced estate tax exemption level expire, you are essentially turning the capital gains tax into a Double Death Tax. With so much of our nation's agricultural economy dependent on the transferring of family farms to the next generation, it is critical that we make this transition as easy and affordable as possible. Your budget proposals do precisely the opposite, and our family farms, agricultural communities, and the country as a whole will bear the consequences,"" the lawmakers added.",kiow.com,news,Mix 107.3 KIOW,,-0.2156862745098039,448859068,1,https://kiow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Feenstra-1.jpg,

The impact of a partial shutdown would be limited if funding is approved over the weekend before the start of the work week. Still, the failure of lawmakers to send the legislation to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature ahead of the deadline would be another sign that the US legislative branch struggles to perform its most basic responsibilities.

It's unclear when the Senate will resolve its issues and pass the legislation. Without an agreement, the Senate is expected to vote to break a filibuster on the package early Sunday afternoon, but there is no exact timing yet.

Because Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made a motion to break a filibuster on the funding package, the Senate will not be permitted to take any action on the bill on Saturday.

It's been a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill. Immediately after the House voted to pass the legislation the Senate is considering, firebrand Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia filed a motion to oust Johnson from the speakership. While the resolution does not need to be addressed immediately, it represents the most formal and strident challenge to the speaker's leadership since he took over in late last year. The final House vote was 286-134,with 112 Republicans and 22 Democrats voting against.

The bill addresses a slate of critical government operations, including the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State and the legislative branch.

Lawmakers unveiled the $1.2 trillion government funding package just before 3 a.m. ET on Thursday, and the text is more than 1,000 pages long.

Schumer said Thursday that the text for the legislative package came ""in the nick of time,"" with fewer than 48 hours out from the deadline for a partial government shutdown. The Democratic leader added, ""Now Congress must now race to pass this package before government funding runs out this Friday. Once the House acts, the Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday's deadline and avoid a shutdown,"" a reference to how any one senator could slow passage of the bill and launch a partial shutdown.

After months of averting shutdowns at the eleventh hour with stopgap bills, Congress finally passed a package of six bills in early March to fund a slate of government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year.

Lawmakers must now fund the rest of the government to wrap up the annual federal funding process, which has dragged on far longer than is typical amid partisan policy disagreements and a historic change of leadership in the House after conservatives ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in an unprecedented vote last year.

Johnson, who won the gavel after McCarthy's ouster, faces an extremely narrow majority and pushback from his right flank over his handling of the government funding fight. With the House starting a two-week recess on Friday, Greene's resolution to oust Johnson will hang over the GOP conference as it considers what to do next in the 118th Congress.

Johnson praised the bill early Thursday morning, outlining conservative wins in the package.

""This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,"" Johnson said in a statement.

House members on both sides of the aisle lashed out Thursday over the agreement, with progressives and far-right members criticizing the legislation for different reasons.

GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN he won't be supporting any Republican who votes for the bill and that leadership ""owns the bill,"" describing the bill as a ""failure.""

""I would have a very difficult time doing that,"" he told CNN's Manu Raju. ""The Republican conference is a failure if they pass this bill.""

House progressives have also been critical with some indicating they will vote against it over provisions that will withhold funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for one year amid the alleged involvement of UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack against Israel.

McCarthy's fate has raised questions over whether Johnson could face a similar threat to his speakership, but many Republicans have made clear they do not want another speaker's race after the intense infighting and chaos triggered by McCarthy's removal.

The separate six-bill funding package, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this month, included funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.

A bench of Justices Yashwant Varma and Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav said the party had challenged the assessment proceedings at a belated stage as it is to be completed by March 31, 2024. The party filed the petitions only on March 19, it said.

The high court said while the notice was issued to the party by the I-T Department on March 7, 2023, the satisfaction note by the assessing officer (AO) appeared to have been provided to the petitioner on June 28 and 30, 2023.

The court said the statutory time-frames mandate assessment to be completed within 12 months from the time when the books of accounts or material are handed over to the AO of the non-searched person.

""This would mean that in the present case and taking the date of handing over or recordal of satisfaction as constituting the date from which that period is liable to be reckoned, the assessment is liable to be completed by March 31, 2024,"" the bench said.

It said, ""The writ petitioner has thus chosen to approach this court only a few days before the time for completion of assessment would expire and at the proverbial fag end of the proceedings. We consequently find no justification to interdict the assessment proceedings at this belated stage by invoking our jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.""

The court, however, left open the question as to whether the delay in commencement of proceedings would be fatal to the assessment.

It said on a prima facie examination, it is evident that the authorities appear to have collated substantial and concrete evidence warranting further scrutiny and examination under the I-T Act.

The Congress has challenged initiation of proceedings under Section 153C (assessment of income of any other person) of the Income Tax Act for assessment pertaining to assessment years 2014-15 to 2016-17.

It has contended that Section 153C action was based on searches which were conducted on four individuals in April, 2019. It said that on the basis of the material which was gathered in those searches, the AO also drew corresponding satisfaction notes for initiation of proceedings against the Congress party.

The petitioner's counsel submitted that the assessment which was proposed to be undertaken for Assessment Years (AY) 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 would be barred by the period of limitation and the I-T department could have gone back to a maximum of six assessment years.

The counsel contended that assessment under Section 153C of the Act could have at best covered the period of AYs 2017-18 to 2020-21 and the three additional AYs 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 would be barred by limitation.

The I-T department, however, asserted there was no violation of any statutory provision by the tax authority and that as per the material recovered, the ""escaped"" income of the party is more than Rs 520 crore.

The high court, in its judgment, said the material which is taken note of in the satisfaction note referred to unaccounted transactions with respect to the Lok Sabha Elections 2019, Madhya Pradesh assembly elections 2018 and MP assembly polls 2013.

Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation Chairman Mark Fox. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and State Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus on Friday signed a historic alcohol tax revenue sharing agreement.

The revenue sharing agreement between the tribe and the state was made possible through legislation, Senate Bill 2377, signed into law by Burgum last year. which allows each of the five tribal nations in North Dakota to enter into an agreement with the state to impose a single tax on alcoholic beverages sold at the retail and wholesale levels within their respective reservations.

Tribal nations that adopt the alcohol tax will keep 80% of the tax revenue, while the state's general fund will receive 20%, with taxes being collected by the Office of State Tax Commissioner. MHA Nation is the first tribe to execute an agreement with the state under the new law.

""The MHA Nation has been contending with the impacts of alcohol being sold on our reservation for a very long time. It has greatly burdened our judicial system with domestic violence, alcohol-related injuries and deaths from vehicle accidents, and various forms of crime,"" Fox said. ""This new tax revenue will help relieve the tremendous amount of money our government spends yearly to provide treatment services related to alcohol addiction, social and wellness services, and supplement enhancements to law enforcement. I would like to thank Governor Burgum, State Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus and the North Dakota State Legislature for working with us on this agreement that benefits our Nation and the State of North Dakota.""

The bill was approved unanimously in both the House and Senate. It improved upon an alcohol tax revenue sharing bill that passed in 2019 but hadn't been utilized.

This agreement underscores the commitment of the state of North Dakota and MHA Nation to work together for the mutual benefit of their communities. It provides exactly the kind of fair and uniform framework for collecting alcohol taxes on reservations that we hoped to achieve when signing the legislation last year,"" Burgum said, noting the bulk of the revenue will go to the tribes to support addiction treatment and other programs.

The Governor's Office had worked with tribal nations, legislators and the Office of the State Tax Commissioner for several years to negotiate an acceptable framework for revenue sharing agreements and avoid a double taxation situation in which both the state and tribe could levy separate alcohol taxes on reservations.

A 45-page HC judgement on Friday listed these purported payments delivered at ""Akbar Road"".

MEIL has emerged as the biggest donor to the BJP through electoral bonds, inviting potshots from the opposition. But the latest revelation by the income tax department could turn the issue on its head. ""The search documents recovered from the MEIL Group appear to indicate unaccounted transfers to the political party (Congress) during Assessment Year's 2017-18 to 2020-21,"" the High Court order has noted. These transfers are part of the Rs 520 crore that the HC has termed to be what allegedly escaped assessment, as per the I-T department.

MEIL and its subsidiary WUPPTCL were raided by the I-T department in 2019. The HC order has recorded that the department seized a handwritten diary of a man named PV Sunil, which had documented payments to the tune of Rs 25.85 crore at ""Akbar Road"" in various tranches between February 28, 2019, and October 1, 2019. The payments ranged between Rs 65 lakh on April 5, 2019, to Rs 6.4 crore on April 20. ""Statement dated 11.10.2019 of PV Sunil accepting he had paid amounts at 24, Akbar Road,"" says the list of evidence furnished by the department. 24, Akbar Road is the AICC office in Delhi.

The I-T department list of evidence further mentions Rs 10.5 crore paid at Akbar Road by MEIL subsidiary WUPPTCL in various tranches between August 22, 2016, and November 8, 2017. The department has claimed that the cash paid by MEIL and WUPPTCL pertains to the period of the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 and the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections of 2018.

Another company raided by the income tax department in 2019, which threw up evidence of cash transactions of the Congress, was the Kakkar-Miglani Group. ""The petitioner (Congress) has woefully failed to establish that the material which forms the bedrock for recordal of satisfaction (by IT Department) is not founded on any data, material evidence or documentation pertaining to AYs' 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17,"" the High Court has said.",news18.com,news,News18,,0.1450980392156862,448857270,1,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-2024-03-22t155748.796-2024-03-1574b2ffa68c19293db49b904eb298c0-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675,eng-9419018

Four property tax bills signed by Gov. Mark Gordon on Thursday provide different areas of relief or tax exemptions, and have different timelines for when they go into effect.

Laramie County Assessor Todd Ernst told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Friday what property owners can expect.

Two bills effective immediately

Ernst said House Bills 4 and 45 are set to take effect this year. House Bill 45 puts a 4% cap on year-to-year property tax increases on residential structures and land. Ernst said he wasn't quite sure how effective the 4% property tax cap will be for Laramie County property owners, since property values have remained ""relatively flat.""

""It's definitely going to help a few people out here. But we are noticing this year that our values are pretty flat from last year,"" Ernst said. ""There are some areas within Laramie County that this cap is definitely going to help. But I'd say for the majority of the people, they're not going to see any type of reduction from this cap of 4%.""

Ernst said a notice about property values will be sent out to homeowners in Laramie County within a couple of weeks. Property owners that have seen their property value increase by more than 4% will receive a notice including the new exemption that shows how much owners will save under this bill.

House Bill 4, ""Property tax refund program,"" expands eligibility for the state's existing property tax refund program. The current program applies to individuals whose gross household income is 125% of the median income; HB expands it to 145%.

Gordon exercised his line-item veto authority on HB 4, removing the highest income category from the bill, which was 165% of the median income. In his letter explaining the line-item veto, the governor said the bill brings expanded and needed relief, but he expressed concern that the $20 million appropriated by the Legislature would be insufficient to fund the program if that highest income category was included.

""I want to thank the Legislature for answering the call and funding an expansion of this program, which helped more than 9,000 Wyoming families last year,"" Gordon said in a news release Thursday.

In his line-item veto letter, however, the governor said he couldn't support extending the refund program to those earning up to 165% of county median income.

Ernst said assessors were supportive of the governor's line-item veto in HB 4.

""Obviously, (Gordon) felt that third tier was just a little too much and wasn't going to relieve a lot of money,"" Ernst said.

This bill applies to property taxes filed for the 2023 tax season, Ernst said, making it effective immediately. Information on the tax relief program is expected to come out in early April, he added, so people can start signing up for it soon.

""As long as they have their taxes paid up, they can definitely apply for this expansion of the relief program,"" he said.

2025 start date

The other two bills, House Bill 3 and Senate File 89, won't take effect until 2025. HB 3, ""Property tax exemption for long-term homeowners,"" provides an exemption of 50% of a property's value for primary residence homeowners if the primary owner of the residence or their spouse is 65 or older and has paid property taxes in the state for 25 years or more.

This exemption won't take effect until 2025, but Ernst said the application period for the property tax exemption should start in September of this year.

SF 89, ""Veterans ad valorem exemption-amount,"" which doubles the veterans tax exemption from $3,000 to $6,000 of assessed value, also won't take effect until the 2025 tax season.

""It's for next year's taxes,"" Ernst said. ""Veterans have ... the benefit of either using it on their real property, so their house, or they can use it on their vehicles.""

Lawmakers give B+ for effort

Rep. Steve Harshman, R-Casper, told the WTE he was overall pleased with the property tax relief bills that were signed into law this week. Nearly two dozen bills were considered over the four-week budget session, some sponsored by committee and others brought by individual lawmakers.

If he had to give a grade for how well the Legislature tackled property tax issues this session, Harshman said he'd give his colleagues a ""good solid B, maybe a B-plus.""

""If we had passed my bill, the two pennies (of additional state sales tax) for a million-dollar exemption, and I'd give us an A,"" Harshman said, laughing.

Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, R-Cheyenne, said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" to see Gordon sign the long-term homeowners tax exemption into law.

""We're optimistic that it's going to provide some major relief to the people who've kind of devoted their lives to Wyoming,"" Zwonitzer said.

Over 100 individuals joined the public gallery at the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees meeting on Thursday, March 21, 2024, to listen into the discussion(s) about the future of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (ODEI) at its institution.

At least 20 individuals provided public testimony each sharing their personal experiences and thoughts about Footnote 12, on the 2025-2026 Biennium budget which states, ""no funds from this appropriation shall be expended on the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the University of Wyoming or on any diversity, equity and inclusion program activity.""

Wyoming Representative Trey Sheerwood took the floor to clarify that this footnote only applies to state aid and not endowment, match, or private funds, as well as stated her hopes for defining what DEI is, is not, and that the two entities (the legislature and the board) can come together to respect and prepare students for their future careers.

Testimonies came from a variety of individuals including students, staff, faculty, and community members, all with similarly resounding themes of concern and how a lack of funding to ODEI the programs it umbrellas are to continue forward.

Programs mentioned included but were not limited to Disability Support Services (DSS), the Veterans Service Center, and Multicultural Affairs.

""I and many others like me do not ask for unfair advantages in becoming successful in life. A large part of becoming successful, however, is having the resources and guidance necessary for navigating higher education and the road beyond. Many of us are first generation students, [are] parents, or come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. We oftentimes don't have a parent, sibling, family member or friend to turn to to help us navigate,"" said Ana Rodriquez, a graduate student and president of the First Generation Organization at the UW College of Law.

""I am disgusted and appalled by this board's willingness to entertain the obvious politicization of mine and this state's higher education. Based on the broadness of this bill. . . and specifically this part, 'or any diversity equity and inclusion program activity or function,' said Tanner Ewalt, a student who described himself as a Cowboy.

""So let me ask you, is Veteran Affairs on the chopping block? DSS? Non-traditional student support, programs for young mothers, for students who are athletes or young freshmen struggling? All of these are on the chopping block, correct? Because at their core they are DEI work.""

These statements were only from the morning round of public testimonies.

It was during the afternoon session where the topic of the ODEI was actually addressed that the audience doubled in size, forcing the venue to accommodate by opening a panel wall in an attempt to provide more seating. Even with the addition of a dozen chairs, the addition was still only standing room.

The board then not only entered discussion about the ODEI but eventually opened the microphone to the gallery once more for additional public comments.

John Luke Wilson, a student and trustee's scholar recipient, reflected upon his activism on the legislature floor and what he would like to see the university do next.

""I think our ODEI does a lot of very important things, including Native American admissions and outreach, first generation help for students, and overall promoting community here in Wyoming. However, I'm aware, unfortunately, a lot of this stuff is already out of your hands. . . So it comes down to a question of what are we going to do about all of these programs?""

Several students provided testament to being part of communities including in DEI's support programs and how the defunding of such programs would impact them.

The court's order is a setback for the Congress, which had challenged the reassessment of its income by the tax department. The court had reserved its order on March 20.

On March 13, the court rejected the Congress's plea appealing an order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal which had rejected its plea seeking a stay on a demand notice for around ₹105 crore issued by the tax department.

The Congress has said its accounts have been frozen, and claimed that the action was politically motivated and aimed at ensuring it didn't have the resources to contest the Lok Sabha elections. A ""systematic effort"" is being made by PM Modi to ""cripple"" the Congress financially, former party chief Sonia Gandhi said in a presser on Thursday.

HT reached out to the Congress for a response on the development, but it declined to comment.

On Friday, a bench of justices Yashwant Varma and Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav in its order dismissing the petition filed by INC said, ""On a prima facie examination, it is evident that the respondents (IT department) appear to have collated substantial and concrete evidence warranting further scrutiny and examination under the Act.""

The order referred to the so-called Satisfaction Note, a document prepared by the tax officer investigating the case, following a search, audit or investigation and pointed out that there were detailed references to unaccounted transactions with respect to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and 2013 and 2018 Madhya Pradesh assembly elections.

""There is a detailed reference to payments allegedly made to MPs/MLAs and candidates. The said note also carries material seeming to suggest payments and contributions made by government departments and corporations, liquor manufacturers, industry entities and individuals to the petitioner (INC),"" the bench said.

The party, represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, questioned the tax notice on the grounds that the assessment with regard to AY (assessment year) 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17 would be barred by limitation due to the long time gap as provided under Section 153C. It also claimed that the satisfaction note did not make any ""explicit reference to incriminating material or assets"" that were discovered and also did not establish a correspondence between the assessment years in question and the assets or material. The bench did not agree. ""We find, prima facie, that the satisfaction note refers to material pertaining to the three AYs in question,"" it said.

The court went through the records presented by the department represented by advocate Zoheb Hossein. It held, ""There is specific reference to unaccounted transactions pertaining to AYs 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. We also take into consideration the indubitable fact that the cumulative figure attributed to income which has allegedly escaped assessment would stand at approximately ₹520 crores.""

The court also criticised the Congress for its delay in approaching it pointing out that the notice was issued on March 7 last year and the satisfaction note prepared by IT department served to the party by June 2023. The assessment process, it added, ought to have completed by March 31, 2024. ""The writ petitioner has thus chosen to approach this Court only a few days before the time for completion of assessment would expire and at the proverbial fag end of the proceedings,"" the judges held, while dismissing the petition.

Nor did the bench buy the Congress' argument on limitation.

""We are of the considered opinion that the material gathered in the course of the search would have empowered and enabled the respondent to undertake an assessment for six assessment years immediately preceding the assessment year pertaining to the previous year in which the search was conducted and would also extend to the four additional AYs' which would stand included by virtue of Explanation 1 to Section 153A of the Act,"" it said.",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,0.1215686274509804,448856928,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/22/1600x900/On-March-13--the-court-rejected-the-Congress-s-ple_1711135753966.jpg,

Within just over two months, a total of 168 individuals have been repatriated to Bulgaria, shedding light on the complexities of international migration policies and their enforcement.

Stoyanov disclosed that the majority of these individuals, numbering 69, arrived from Austria, illustrating the interconnectedness of European nations in managing migration flows. Additionally, Bulgaria has received migrants from a diverse array of countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Poland, and the Czech Republic.

Crucially, Stoyanov emphasized that all returned foreigners are candidates for international protection within Bulgaria, highlighting the nation's commitment to upholding humanitarian principles in its immigration procedures. Among those returned is a Moroccan individual identified as wanted for a crime in Germany, underscoring the challenges posed by transnational criminal activity within migration contexts.

Furthermore, Stoyanov revealed that Bulgaria has reciprocated by returning 225 foreigners to their countries of origin during the same period, showcasing the multifaceted nature of bilateral and multilateral cooperation in addressing migration challenges.

Konstantinos Karagiorgis, director of the Consumer Protection Service at the Ministry of Energy, Trade and Industry, stated that ""the reintroduction of the consumption tax on fuels is expected at midnight on the last day of the current month."" He added that this means the tax of 8.3 cents per liter will be reinstated for 95-octane gasoline and diesel, and 6.3 cents per liter for heating oil.

Karagiorgis noted that there has been a significant decrease in prices in the fuel sector over the last quarter, which halted two weeks ago, followed by price stabilization. However, in recent days, there have been minor increases in fuel prices.

Additionally, Cyprus currently boasts the cheapest fuels in Europe, according to the European Price Observatory.

Regarding the removal of the VAT subsidy and the reinstatement of VAT on 11 specific product categories, Karagiorgis mentioned that VAT will be reinstated to nine categories by April 30 and the remaining two categories, concerning meat and vegetables, by May 31.

He predicts a market rebound post-elections driven by corporate earnings, particularly in the SMID space. Additionally, he recommends Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) as a tax-saving option offering long-term capital appreciation. Despite new tax regulations, ELSS remains appealing to investors due to its strong risk-adjusted returns, with about one-third of funds surpassing benchmarks.

1) How do you assess the current domestic and global market conditions, and what factors are you closely monitoring?

Inflation and geopolitical tension are the main factors impacting the global economy at present. US inflation, still hovering above the 3% level is proving to be stickier and more persistent, hence rates are likely to remain higher for the time being and any cut is unlikely in 1HCY24. To add to the concerns, the Red Sea attack by the Houthis added to higher freight rates across the globe. With Japan ending the negative interest rate regime, US Treasuries could be impacted to some extent as the Japanese hold a significant amount of US Treasuries.

Indian market is witnessing a healthy correction, which was expected especially in the SMID space. This correction is going to be short-lived and markets are expected to continue to rise post-election and with the support of corporate earnings.

The market has already factored in a BJP-led majority government for next term and any disappointment could be majorly negative. Meanwhile, the current spell of El Nino is likely to end by May thereby raising the expectation of normal rainfall this year. This augurs well for the agrarian rural economy as well as keeps inflation under check.

2) What are your views on the Indian equity market's valuation levels, and where do you see potential opportunities?

There is no doubt that the valuation looks expensive, especially in the SMID space. The ongoing correction is welcome and should be considered as a buying opportunity in a staggered manner. Amidst the backdrop of slower growth in major economies, India is in a sweet spot. With a modest current account deficit, fiscal prudence by the government, focus on infrastructure, and import substitution playing a key theme, India can sustain 6% to 7% annual GDP growth. In line with the government's focus, opportunities remain in semiconductors, renewable energy, defence, infrastructure, and railways.

3) Insights on the role of tax-saving funds in an investor's overall wealth creation strategy

Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) have the dual advantage of tax savings as well as long-term capital appreciation. Compared to the other options available under section 80C ELSS schemes have given superior inflation-adjusted returns.

The lock-in period of 3 years (which is one of the lowest compared to other tax-saving instruments) helps in countering temporary instabilities in the equity market. AUM of ELSS funds stood at ₹2,12,854 crore as of February 2024, a 20% CAGR over the last 3 years and this indicates the growing popularity of ELSS Tax Saving instruments.

4) How do you manage the risks associated with equity investments in an ELSS fund, given the market volatility?

Appropriate hedging strategies are in place to tide over any market volatility. Strict adherence to valuation is also adopted to reduce volatility. Also, we use the proprietary Quantamental model where in low volatility, valuation are key factors that help to navigate through market corrections

5) How has the performance of ELSS funds fared in comparison to their respective benchmarks over the past three and five-year periods?

Around one-third of the funds were able to beat the benchmark (NSE 500). The category has delivered approximately 37% in the last 1 year and 16% CAGR in the last 5 years.

6) To what extent has the introduction of the new tax regime impacted the demand and relevance of tax-saving mutual funds?

The new tax regime is yet to have any meaningful impact on the demand for ELSS schemes. This is because the new tax regime is optional for individuals and this will be more optimal for individuals who are in a lesser tax regime. Also, the superior risk-adjusted return of ELSS schemes compared to other tax saving instruments makes it attractive to tax savers.

Mark Gordon on Friday for his veto of a bill that would have provided property tax relief for all Wyoming homeowners.

Out of nearly two dozen property tax bills considered over the 2025-26 biennium budget session, only five made it to the governor's desk. Four of the five bills were signed into law by Gordon on Thursday -- Senate File 54, ""Homeowner tax exemption,"" was the one bill he vetoed.

Over the next two years, SF 54 would have provided a 25% tax reduction for all Wyoming homeowners up to the first $2 million of assessed value for a residential property, based on the fair market value of the home. The bill included a backfill for loss in tax revenue to local school districts, cities, counties and special districts.

The fiscal impact of this backfill on the state was estimated to be at least $220 million, if not more.

""The Bidenomic-type of 'tax relief' in this bill is what I would expect from Washington, D.C. liberals, not conservative Wyoming legislators,"" Gordon said a veto letter accompanying a late Thursday news release. ""It is a temporary relief measure that could lead to budget shortfalls, and will ultimately be paid for by raising taxes on our children.""

Rep. Steve Harshman, R-Casper, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Friday he was disappointed that the bill failed to become law. When he first read the governor's news release Thursday night, Harshman said he was ""irked"" by the governor's choice of words.

""We put a lot of time into that bill,"" Harshman said. ""Unfortunately, I think in politics we kind of take swipes at each other like that.""

Since the Cowboy State had a recent surplus in revenue from its mineral industry, Harshman, who chairs the House Revenue Committee, hoped the state would provide a little more relief to Wyomingites. It wasn't permanent relief, he said, just an opportunity to give Wyomingites a break for a couple of years.

""It wasn't gonna be a long-term deal,"" Harshman said. ""It was disappointing, because I think folks would have really welcomed that.""

Rep. Clark Stith, R-Rock Springs, said in a news release that Wyoming property taxes have skyrocketed, with double-digit increases felt across many communities due to surging property values. Legislators listened to hours of testimony and received hundreds of emails about the issue, he said.

""This committee bill was the result of hard work and compromise, with overwhelming support in both chambers. To have it vetoed blindsided us,"" Stith said in the release.

Laramie County Assessor Todd Ernst told the WTE this bill would have helped every homeowner in Laramie County and across the state of Wyoming. He wasn't in favor or against the bill, but SF 54 was the only one Ernst said would provide relief across the board.

Senate President Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, and House Speaker Albert Sommers, R-Pinedale, broke their silence on the governor's recent vetoes, including SF 54, in a joint news release on Friday afternoon.

The legislative leaders said they've become ""increasingly concerned about the Governor's disregard for the will of the people's representatives and the legislation we have passed."" This concern was only further heightened by his latest veto, according to the release.

""We are extremely disappointed that Governor Gordon would characterize this relief from skyrocketing property taxes as a giveaway to Wyoming citizens,"" they said in the release. ""Despite the Governor trying to characterize this bill as liberal spending, he forgets that cutting taxes is a conservative value. Time-limited tax relief is both conservative and prudent.""

However, Republican Cheyenne lawmakers Rep. Dan Zwonitzer and Sen. Stephan Pappas said they weren't quite as surprised to see Gordon nix SF 54. Zwonitzer told the WTE it was difficult to calculate the fiscal impact the bill would have on the state, with so many amendments added in the final two weeks of the session.

""There were too many ideas and too short of a time with too many numbers,"" Zwonitzer said. ""We tried to quantify it, we thought it would be about a quarter of a billion. But there were some people saying we could be wildly off.""

Pappas said in an email to the WTE he originally opposed the bill while it was worked on in committee. He supported it in the end, however, after lawmakers added a backfill to support the loss of local tax revenue and added a sunset date -- but even then, the senator said he was still reluctant.

Although the bill would have provided relief to homeowners, Pappas said it didn't provide relief to Wyoming's industries, ""which are paying the bulk of the taxes.""

""Wyoming's tax structure is truly lopsided,"" Pappas said. ""We need to find a more balanced system so the tax burden is more equitable amongst all taxpayers.""

Ukraine aims to secure the purchase of two nuclear reactors from Bulgaria to bolster its energy capacity, with hopes of finalizing the agreement as early as June.

The head of Ukraine's nuclear company, Energoatom, revealed to Reuters the pressing necessity for supplementary power generation in light of the shutdown of theZaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility housing six reactors.

The proposed deal entails installing the acquired reactors at Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant in the western region, equipped with Russian-designed components sourced from Bulgaria. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, underscored the significance of expediting negotiations, emphasizing the impending energy crisis and the vital role these reactors would play in mitigating it.

While negotiations between the Ukrainian and Bulgarian governments continue, Kotin expressed optimism regarding the likelihood of reaching a consensus by June. He outlined plans for the swift installation of the first reactor, setting a demanding timeline for its completion to address the pressing energy demands.

In addition to the procurement of reactors, Energoatom is also exploring collaborations with General Electric for the construction of essential turbine components, essential for reactor operation. The ambitious endeavor aims to bolster Ukraine's energy independence and resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges.

However, the negotiations have encountered hurdles, with Bulgaria initially seeking to revise the pricing terms for the reactors. Despite the price adjustments proposed by Bulgaria, Ukraine remains steadfast in its pursuit of an equitable agreement, prioritizing affordability amidst escalating energy demands.

The genesis of the proposed deal can be traced back to Bulgaria's earlier acquisition of the reactors for the planned Belene Nuclear Power Plant. In a strategic move, Bulgaria authorized the potential sale of these reactors to Ukraine, recognizing the imperative of bolstering regional energy security and cooperation.

Meanwhile, amidst the ongoing energy crisis exacerbated by the closure of theZaporizhzhia plant, Ukraine remains resolute in its determination to restore the facility to operational status. Despite logistical and infrastructural challenges, Energoatom retains preparedness to recommission the plant post-""de-occupation,"" underscoring Ukraine's commitment to energy sovereignty and resilience.

Within just over two months, a total of 168 individuals have been repatriated to Bulgaria, shedding light on the complexities of international migration policies and their enforcement.

Stoyanov disclosed that the majority of these individuals, numbering 69, arrived from Austria, illustrating the interconnectedness of European nations in managing migration flows. Additionally, Bulgaria has received migrants from a diverse array of countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Poland, and the Czech Republic.

Crucially, Stoyanov emphasized that all returned foreigners are candidates for international protection within Bulgaria, highlighting the nation's commitment to upholding humanitarian principles in its immigration procedures. Among those returned is a Moroccan individual identified as wanted for a crime in Germany, underscoring the challenges posed by transnational criminal activity within migration contexts.

Furthermore, Stoyanov revealed that Bulgaria has reciprocated by returning 225 foreigners to their countries of origin during the same period, showcasing the multifaceted nature of bilateral and multilateral cooperation in addressing migration challenges.

During the event ""Fuelling Economic Growth through Increased Tobacco Taxation"" organised by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC), activists urged the Government of Pakistan to transition to a Single Tier Tobacco Taxation System, thereby eliminating the second tier. This strategic move is deemed essential not only for boosting revenue but also for relieving the healthcare cost burdens imposed by tobacco-related illnesses.

Malik Imran Ahmed, Country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids (CTFK), highlighted the alignment between the IMF's recommendations and the ongoing discussions with Pakistan. These discussions aim to tackle the nation's fiscal and external sustainability weaknesses while fostering economic recovery and inclusive growth. A key component involves strengthening public finances through gradual fiscal consolidation, broadening the tax base in undertaxed sectors, and improving tax administration to enhance debt sustainability. Imran emphasized the urgent need to tie these objectives with tobacco taxation, stressing the imperative of reforming Pakistan's cigarette taxation system.

Malik Imran further emphasized that revitalizing Pakistan's cigarette taxation system transcends mere fiscal considerations; it is a matter of urgent public health concern. He lamented that despite the substantial taxes imposed on cigarettes, the revenue generated falls short of covering the healthcare costs incurred due to smoking-related illnesses.

The defeat shows the challenges that Johnson faces trying to enact his campaign's policies.

Opponents warned that the tax hike would hurt the city's already fragile real estate market, while proponents said measure would have raised $100 million a year.

It's challenging to get public buy-in for local tax hikes, especially those tied to property, according to John Hansen, a professor at the University of Chicago's Department of Political Science.

""This is a city where we have already seen very large increases in taxes, very large increases in the cost of services because of policy decisions that have been made by the city government,"" he said.

Adding to Chicago's housing challenges, more than 68,000 people were experiencing homelessness in 2021. The strain has been exacerbated by the arrival of more than 37,000 migrants to the city and its suburbs over the past year and a half.

The measure also pitched lowering the transfer tax on properties under $1 million, which represents the vast majority of home sales in the nation's third-largest city.

When the scientists reviewed the photos their submersible had taken, they were amazed to find a thriving community of living creatures. In an article published soon afterwards, the scientist Robert Ballard marvelled that the photograph taken just seconds before the temperature anomaly showed only barren, fresh-looking lava terrain. But for ""13 frames (the length of the anomaly), the lava flow was covered with hundreds of white clams and brown mussel shells. This dense accumulation, never seen before in the deep sea, quickly appeared through a cloud of misty blue water and then disappeared from view. For the remaining 1,500 pictures, the bottom was once again barren of life.""

Since that first discovery, more than 600 fields of vents have been identified, all teeming with living organisms. Specially adapted colonies of mussels and other shellfish cling to their seething columns alongside fields of feathery worms and starfish; crabs and shrimp dart here and there, feeding in the cloudy water. Such richness of life should be impossible in the darkness of the ocean's depths - without sunlight there is no photosynthesis. But the creatures that thrive around the vents do not draw upon the sun's energy. Instead, they rely on chemosynthetic microbes capable of transforming the chemicals produced by the vents into energy.

The discovery of animals around hydrothermal vents has led to a dramatic broadening of our understanding of the sorts of environments in which life can survive. This has significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life - if life thrives in such environments on Earth, it is plausible it might flourish in similar conditions in the oceans of ice moons such as Enceladus, which orbits Saturn. It has also shifted assumptions about where life on Earth began: perhaps it was not in a shallow pool, but somewhere in the depths of the primordial sea. In other words, the deep ocean might not be a place of death and forgetting, but rather the birthplace of life on our planet.",despardes.com,news,DesPardes + PKonweb,,-0.05882352941176472,448854300,21,https://i0.wp.com/despardes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sea-creature-mar2024.jpg?fit=640%2C308&ssl=1&w=640,

(WKRN) -- Tennessee's franchise tax on businesses is based on their property in the state.

But a new bill from Governor Bill Lee's office is set to do two things - refund businesses back three years who have paid a franchise tax and then also cut the tax moving forward.

It's over a billion dollars for the refund and about $400 million each year after that.

""This is the right solution for the problem that was presented to us as a state,"" Gov. Bill Lee (R-Tennessee) said. ""This solution that we have put out there as a framework is the right way forward.""

Thursday, the Senate passed the initiative.

The move incensed Senate Democrats, saying they don't understand how this is a conservative fiscal decision.

""What happened today was a departure from long-standing practice and norms in this body to be fiscally responsible, to ensure that we're being fully deliberate and have a sound basis for how we allocate taxpayer dollars,"" Sen. Jeff Yarbro (D-Nashville) said.

But Senate Republicans say paying a lot upfront now will protect the state from fees from future potential lawsuits.

""Nobody likes it. Nobody likes having to vote for this, nobody likes having to do this,"" Sen. Bo Watson (R-Hixson) said. ""But in terms of being the best remedy that courts would look at, this is a reasonable solution anybody moving forward really doesn't have any kind of basis for a challenge to the state on this.""

The bill has yet to even begin the committee process in the House. In fact, the House has a different version of the same bill.

""The similar part will be the $400 million tax cut,"" Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton (R-Crossville) said. ""The other part will not be similar.""

It's the latest inconsistency between the two chambers, as they are facing different versions or disagreements on the education voucher scholarship bill, several LGBTQ+ bills, and Tennessee State University.

When Senate leaders were asked about the House's ideas around the franchise tax, they seemed frustrated by a lack of communication.

""The writ petitioner has... chosen to approach this court only a few days before the time for completion of assessment would expire and at the proverbial fag end of the proceedings. We consequently find no justification to interdict the assessment proceedings at this belated stage by invoking our jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution,"" a Bench of Justice Yashwant Varma and Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav said.

Noting that the notice was issued to the Congress by the I-T Department on March 7, 2023, and the satisfaction note by the Assessing Officer (AO) appeared to have been provided to the petitioner on June 28 and 30, 2023, the Bench said the party challenged the assessment proceedings at a belated stage as it's to be completed by March 31, 2024. The party filed the petitions only on March 19, it said.

The high court, however, left open the question as to whether the delay in commencement of proceedings would be fatal to the assessment.

The court said the statutory time-frames mandate assessment to be completed within 12 months from the time when the books of accounts or material are handed over to the AO of the non-searched person.

""This would mean that in the present case and taking the date of handing over or recordal of satisfaction as constituting the date from which that period is liable to be reckoned, the assessment is liable to be completed by March 31, 2024,"" the Bench said. It said on a prima facie examination, it was evident that the authorities appeared to have collated substantial and concrete evidence warranting further scrutiny and examination under the I-T Act.

Recently, the high court had refused to interfere with the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal declining to stay a notice issued by the I-T Department to the Congress for recovery of outstanding tax of more than Rs 100 crore.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says it has uncovered over $1 billion in potentially fraudulent pandemic-era tax credit claims in the last six months alone, with another $3 billion in potentially bad claims that are being looked into by its criminal investigations unit.

""The IRS has made important progress in our compliance efforts protecting more than $1 billion in revenue in just six months, but we remain deeply concerned about widespread abuse involving these claims that have harmed small businesses,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.

The ERC is a refundable tax credit designed for businesses that continued paying employees during COVID-19 lockdowns.

A tidal wave of bad ERC claims were pushed by predatory promoters on unwitting businesses, leading the IRS to ramp up its enforcement activities to prevent improper claims from being paid out and slimming the agency's tax revenues.

Besides imposing a freeze on filing new ERC claims on Sept. 14, 2023, the IRS also rolled out several programs meant to give businesses that incorrectly claimed the credit a chance to pay it back with minimal penalty.

The IRS said that, in addition to the $1 billion in foiled bad claims, the IRS Criminal Investigation unit is reviewing another $3 billion in potentially fraudulent or otherwise improper claims.

The IRS has found that over 12,000 entities filed over 22,000 bad claims that resulted in $572 million in assessments.

In exchange for volunteering this information, businesses get to keep 20 percent of the incorrectly received credits, and they won't be charged any interest or penalties on the remaining 80 percent that they repay.

Those that are unable to repay the 80 percent can potentially be approved for an installment agreement, which will let them pay it back over a longer period.

Program applicants must not be under criminal investigation, nor be under an IRS employment tax examination, nor can they have received an IRS notice and demand for repayment of the ERC.

The IRS is also using the program to get at unscrupulous promoters who used aggressive marketing techniques to lure businesses into wrongly claiming the ERC.

In order to qualify for the program, employers must provide the IRS with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any advisers or tax preparers who advised or assisted with the claims.

The IRS said on March 22 that the voluntary disclosure program has yielded $225 million from over 500 taxpayers, with another 800 submissions still being processed.

The deadline for making submissions under this program was March 22 but the IRS said it might reopen the program at a future date, though this would require Congressional action to extend the statute of limitations for ERC claims.

The withdrawal option lets employers avoid future problems by withdrawing pending ERC claims if they suspect they may have been tricked into filing and have not yet been paid.

Even if a business has received the ERC refund check but hasn't yet cashed or deposited it, it can still withdraw its claim.

Claims that are withdrawn will be treated by the IRS as if they were never filed, and the agency won't impose penalties or interest.

The IRS said on March 22 that this program has led to 1,800 withdrawing $251 million worth of claims.

The withdrawal program remains open beyond March 22 so businesses with unprocessed bad ERC claims continue to have an option to pull back on them.",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,-0.2941176470588235,448853454,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/02/18/id5589772-06282023-DSC05012-IRSKO-1080x720.jpg,eng-9411260

Taxes, of course, are important and are a collective investment in our society. They are how we fund vital government services that cannot be effectively delivered through the private sector or charitable works. But how much people are taxed and by which levels of government is a far more complicated, and important, question.

The most burdensome form of taxation here in Maine is property taxes. In part because of unnecessarily restrictive provisions in the Maine Constitution, cities like Biddeford must tax property within a certain percentage of the assessed value. Unfortunately, in an overheated real estate market like the one we are still in, this is for so many folks in Biddeford and throughout our state.

I know many people are struggling with this, so I'd like to discuss a few things we have done in the Legislature to mitigate rising property taxes and provide relief, as well as outline some further steps I am pushing for the state to take.

Last year, we increased property tax relief for older Mainers by bolstering the Property Tax Fairness Credit and expanding the Property Tax Deferral Program, helping more folks age with dignity in their communities. Additionally, this session the Maine House voted near-unanimously on a measure that would expand income eligibility for the Property Tax Fairness Credit, so more low-income Mainers can benefit.

We've recently expanded the Homestead Exemption, which allows permanent Maine residents who have owned their home for at least 12 months to reduce its value and, subsequently, their property tax burden. We've also bolstered property tax benefits for disabled veterans, providing additional relief for those who have sacrificed so much for our country.

We have also continued initiatives that help stabilize property taxes, such as maintaining municipal revenue sharing at 5% and paying 55% of the cost of public education.

Advertisement

These initiatives are crucial, but I realize that property taxes continue to go up for many, and noting that things could be worse provides little consolation. There are a few more steps I am advocating here at the Legislature, including:

* Adjusting the school funding formula. Many communities far wealthier than Biddeford receive greater state subsidies than we do. This is unjust and needs to be fixed.

* Amending the Maine Constitution to allow municipalities more flexibility - if they choose - in how they levy property taxes. For instance, they could choose to tax out-of-state property owners at a higher rate than local residents.

* Building more housing people can afford, from affordable housing units to ""starter homes"", so that the tight housing supply doesn't continue to send prices skyrocketing. More housing equals greater tax stability.

I am committed to creating a fairer tax structure that provides meaningful relief to those in need. My Republican colleagues frequently demand income tax cuts, but those would only benefit the wealthiest Mainers. We must focus on strategic investments and targeted credits to support working families and those living on fixed-incomes.

I want to hear what you think, so please do not hesitate to let me know (whether we agree or not!). I can be reached at marc.malon@legislature.maine.gov or my office, (207) 287-1430, with any legislative concerns you have.

Rep. Marc Malon is serving his first term in the Maine House, representing a portion of Biddeford. He serves as a member of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee and the Labor and Housing Committee.

They expressed their view during an event titled 'Fuelling Economic Growth through Increased Tobac­co Taxation' organised by the Society for the Protec­tion of the Rights of the Child (SPARC) here on Friday.

In their remarks, the activists urged the govern­ment of Pakistan to transition to a Single Tier To­bacco Taxation System, thereby eliminating the sec­ond tier. This strategic move is deemed essential not only for boosting revenue but also for relieving the healthcare cost burdens imposed by tobacco-related illnesses.

In his remarks, Country Head Campaign for Tobac­co Free Kids (CTFK), Malik Imran Ahmed, highlighted the alignment between the IMF's recommendations and the ongoing discussions with Pakistan. These discussions aim to tackle the nation's fiscal and ex­ternal sustainability weaknesses while fostering eco­nomic recovery and inclusive growth. A key compo­nent involves strengthening public finances through gradual fiscal consolidation, broadening the tax base in undertaxed sectors, and improving tax adminis­tration to enhance debt sustainability. Imran empha­sized the urgent need to tie these objectives with to­bacco taxation, stressing the imperative of reforming Pakistan's cigarette taxation system.

Malik Imran further emphasised that revitalizing Pakistan's cigarette taxation system transcends mere fiscal considerations; it is a matter of urgent public health concern.

Dr Khalil Ahmad Dogar, Program Manager at SPARC, underscored the alarming prevalence of tobacco use in Pakistan.

CHICAGO -- Chicago voters have rejected a one-time real estate tax on properties over $1 million to pay for services for homeless people.

It's a loss for first-term Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who championed the so-called ""mansion tax.""

The proposal would have incrementally raised the city's real estate transfer tax on properties valued at more than $1 million. Supporters estimated it would have generated $100 million annually for homeless services, including for mental health care. There are roughly 68,000 homeless people in Chicago on any given night.

The measure also pitched lowering the transfer tax on properties under $1 million, which represents the vast majority of home sales in the nation's third-largest city.

Opponents, including real estate groups, argued the tax unfairly targets commercial properties and business as downtown is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. They initially won their lawsuit targeting the measure on constitutional grounds, but it was overturned by an appeals court. The Illinois Supreme Court declined their motion for an appeal.

The AP called the race at 6 p.m., explaining the proposal was rejected by a margin of 53.2% compared to 46.8%, with 100% of precincts reporting. While a number of vote-by-mail ballots processed on Friday were taken into account, the results were similar to preliminary numbers on Election Night.

As of Wednesday morning, results showed 54% of voters, or 166,285, voting ""no"" on the referendum, while 143,624, or 46%, voted ""yes."" At that point, 98% precincts were reporting.

The measure, which sought to increase the city's real estate transfer tax on all properties over $1 million and use the funding to address homelessness, was referred to by some as a ""mansion tax.""

Rather than taxing property specifically, transfer taxes only apply when a property is sold, whether that be a residential or a commercial property.

As things stand, all real estate transfers in the city are taxed at a rate of $3.75 per $500 of assessed value.

The Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, which has been opposed to the referendum, issued a statement on its defeat.

Now that Mayor Johnson's real estate tax increase has been rejected by voters, we reissue our repeated calls for the City to convene all stakeholders to develop solutions that move Chicago forward,"" said Farzin Parang, BOMA/Chicago Executive Director. ""Not only do we need to address the critical challenge of homelessness, we also need to develop a plan to rebuild our downtown and bolster our neighborhoods. These challenges are closely interconnected, and we must work in concert to solve them.""

Supporters of the measure said the measure would decrease the transfer tax rates for 94% of properties in the city, but opponents warn that it would have had a damaging impact on commercial real estate transfers, causing fewer businesses to relocate into the city.

The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, which supported the proposal, said the results of the election don't end its fight.

""And so, while we are disappointed in the results, we continue to stay focused on what matters most: the building of a long-term movement for housing justice, with, for, and by the 68,000 Chicagoans experiencing homelessness in one of the richest cities in the world,"" the group said.

Map shows every state's grade,"(NEXSTAR) - Tax season isn't really fun for anyone, but some states' residents have it harder than others this time of year.

As families around the country collect their paperwork and get ready to file, people in Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa and New Jersey may find themselves with a heftier tax bill than their neighbors in other states.

An updated analysis by MoneyGeek, a personal finance site, evaluates how ""tax friendly"" each state is by calculating the tax burden on the average citizen. States with low tax burdens earned an A, while those with the highest tax burden earned Fs.

The state that scored worst overall was Illinois, where taxes represent about 13% of a median family's income.

Unsurprisingly, the states with no state income taxes at all ended up scoring pretty highly. Those eight states are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.

But in some of those states, higher sales tax rates or property tax rates are in place to make up for the lower income tax revenue. Tennessee and Washington have some of the highest sales tax rates in the country, the Tax Foundation says.

According to the updated MoneyGeek analysis, the most ""tax friendly"" state overall was Nevada, where the median family owes about 4% of its income in taxes.

Meanwhile, 13 states earned either a D or F grade for tax burdens. For some of those states, like Oregon, high personal income tax rates are to blame. In others, like Illinois, high property taxes are a major factor. New Jersey, which earned an F from MoneyGeek, residents have a double whammy of high income and property taxes.

The states with the highest top personal income tax rates are California, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon and Minnesota, TurboTax reports, but that doesn't necessarily mean people in those states are getting hit hardest in the end. Each of those states has its own complex set of rules of tax credits, deductions and income floors to pay any state taxes at all.

To conduct the study, MoneyGeek looked at how much a hypothetical family would pay in taxes if they were a married couple with one dependent, a gross income of $94,003 (the median national income at the time of research), and a home worth about $320,900 (the median price of a new home). The lower the taxes on this hypothetical average family, the better the grade.

MoneyGeek's system of grading states on tax burden only holds true for that hypothetical family. A family who just bought a $1.5 million house in California would probably be paying a lot more in taxes, while a single person who earns $40,000 and is a renter in Texas would pay less.

Lai Wei Sieng of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said those who would purchase luxury goods were high-income earners, namely some of those in the middle-income M40 group and a majority of the high-income T20.

""Those who can afford to buy luxury goods would not be turned off by the additional 5% or 10% increase in the price,"" he told FMT.

Earlier this week, the finance ministry said it was finalising several policies related to the high-value goods tax, including the type of items which would be levied. The ministry is also looking at the price threshold that would determine what is a high value item.

The luxury tax is expected to apply on items such as jewellery and watches that exceeded a certain price threshold. It is expected to earn the government RM700 million annually.

Lai also said the proposed rate of between 5% and 10% was reasonable, when compared to other countries like China and Indonesia.

China's luxury tax is reported to be between 30% and 40% on imported high-end goods, with the Chinese government considering lowering it by 10%. In Indonesia, the tax ranges from 10% to 95%.

Lai said the expected revenue from the tax meant that the government could channel the funds for development and help reduce the national debt, which had ballooned to RM1.08 trillion in 2022.

""The HVGT can help the government without affecting the cost of living for many,"" Lai said, adding that the government's plans to allow tourists to claim relevant tax refunds before departure would not discourage them from buying luxury goods.

Yeah Kim Leng of Sunway University said the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio has been declining steadily over the decades and now ranks lower than some of Malaysia's regional peers.

In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that Malaysia's tax revenue-to-GDP ratio stood at just 11.8%, lower than Thailand (16.4%), the Philippines (18.1%) and Vietnam (18.2%).

Yeah, who sits on a special advisory body to assist Anwar Ibrahim as finance minister, said higher tax revenue is needed to restore the government's fiscal position that has been in deficit since 1998.

""Expanding the tax base (including via the HVGT) will strengthen the government's fiscal resilience, allowing for better response to economic downturns,"" he said.

A broadening of the tax base will also increase the government's fiscal resilience and enhance its ability to mount counter-cyclical spending in the event of an economic downturn caused by external factors.

It is one of the sectors of activity ""targeted"" by the services of Urssaf Languedoc Roussillon. MAXPPP - Vanessa MEYER

The construction sector remains the most affected by hidden work, with more than 19 million euros in adjustments last year. All that remains is to make the companies that commit fraud pay.

The twenty specialized inspectors from Urssaf Languedoc Roussillon broke a record in 2023. They totaled 29.4 million euros in recovery, as part of the fight against work concealed.

A record since in 2022, the level of adjustments reached 21 million euros and in 2021, it was 13 million. The doubling, two years ago, of the number of inspectors has something to do with it.

""This fight ensures good competition between companies, between those who pay their social security contributions and those who do not , explains François Hiebel, regional director. It also ensures the rights of employees, who are subject to the attitude of those who employ them.

Last year, Urssaf Languedoc Roussillon initiated 1,233 actions to combat hidden work. Nearly a thousand of them consisted of prevention actions. ""At the start of summer, for example, we will check with cafes, hotels and restaurants that they have correctly declared their employees as part of the season&quot ;, says Elidie Mentrel, director of control.

Nearly 30% of these prevention actions were carried out in the construction sector and 20.23% in the hotel industry. The security sector is also particularly targeted. ""The fight against hidden work in this sector has led us to commit nearly 6 million euros in adjustments"". But it' is the building which remains the most affected, with 19 million euros.

Urssaf Languedoc Roussillon inspectors are targeting the behavior of sectors accustomed to practicing social fraud. ""We have targeted actions on types of businesses, where we know that we will have a good chance of finding work illegal"", confides François Hiebel.

Fraud does not only affect businesses, self-employed businesses are also in the sights of the institution's inspectors. Of the 233 targeted actions, 133 concerned self-employed businesses. And here again, it is in the construction sector that ""fraud is the most significant"".

It remains for the regional services of Urssaf to ensure that these adjustments are followed by effects. That companies caught committing fraud pay the sums claimed. ""When recoveries concern contributions, in 99% of cases, penalties are paid. But for illegal work, it's more complicated"", recognizes the regional director.

Thus, in 2023, its services were able to recover around 2 million euros from actions undertaken in previous years. It's a little and a lot at the same time, knowing that ""very often, fraudsters disappear without a trace"".

The examples of controls carried out by Urssaf inspectors in the region often highlight the problem. day of practices that are costly to offenders. Thus, in Aude, they sanctioned of a recovery of 1.9 million euros a construction company ""having falsely implementedé its headquarters in the Paris region. It did not declare "" any employeesé ;quot;. In Hérault, it'is a ""fraudulent set-up involving a Portuguese company"", which was é sanctioned a recovery of 1.8 million euros. The company, ""which had no activity' in Portugal"", had ""falsely"" seconded to employees in France. In the Pyrénées-Orientales, following à of the reports received, the inspectors took action day a system of false invoices, which made it possible to ""conceal an activityé significant salary"". His actions earned à the companyé a recovery of 900,000 euros.

The sanction is financial, but also criminal. ""We seize the public prosecutor's office as soon as a case is registered"", specifies François Hiebel, who has already set a financial objective of adjustments for the coming years: ""150 million euros by 2027"".",bobrtimes.com,news,bobrtimes.com,,-0.1764705882352942,448851441,1,,eng-9413843

An Ontario man has been given a three-year prison sentence for his role in a fraud case involving more than $34 million in false charitable donations.

The Canada Revenue Agency says Festus Bayden, of Brampton, Ont., was a partner in a tax preparation business known as E & F Tax Associates or as Bankay Financial Services Inc. in Toronto and later in Brampton.

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

""These promoters deliberately make false statements to assist their clients in avoiding or evading tax,"" the Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement.

""As a result, they obtain a financial benefit from the fees they receive from their clients.

The top-seed Tar Heels punched their ticket with a resounding 90-62 win over No. 16 seed Wagner, while the Spartans used their three-point attack to defeat No. 8 Mississippi State 69-51.

This is the first meeting between the two programs in the NCAA Tournament since North Carolina's 89-72 win in the 2009 National Championship Game.

Their last regular season matchup took place on Nov. 26, 2017 in the PK80 Tournament in Portland, OR, where the Spartans secured a 63-45 win.

As the two schools go head-to-head for the 17th time, the Tar Heels will look to improve to 23-1 in their last 24 games against NCAA Tournament opponents seeded nine or lower.

With a dynamic backcourt in Tyson Walker, A.J. Hoggard, and Jaden Akins, three of Michigan State's top four scorers, the North Carolina defense will have its hands full.

The trio averages a combined 39.5 points per game, while committing just 4.2 turnovers per contest.

Ahead of the Saturday matinee, Hubert Davis and the Tar Heels spoke to the media, providing thoughts on their second round opponent.

Q. Hubert, with the retirements of a bunch of legendary college basketball coaches in the last few years Coach Izzo is the elder statesman of college basketball, or one of them. How cool is it for you to go up against someone like that for the first time?

HUBERT DAVIS: It's just really cool to be a part of college basketball and specifically be a coach alongside Coach Izzo. I, for the longest of times, have been one of his biggest fans. As a player, I would have loved to play for him because it's not only his commitment to his players on the court but his commitment to his players off the court to the university and the community. I think he teaches life through basketball, and that's something that I experienced at Carolina through Coach Smith. When I see Coach Izzo, it reminds me a lot of Coach Smith. So it really is -- I say this a lot, but it is. It's an honor and a privilege to be on the sideline alongside with him, and for both of our teams to have an opportunity and a chance to compete tomorrow is a really big deal.

Q. When you watch Michigan State on film, what stands out?

CORMAC RYAN: They're a physical team. They're good defensively. They've got a really good half-court defense. They like to push the pace in transition. We did some scouting personnel obviously last night. So we're ready to go out and compete and play against a good team on Saturday.""

HARRISON INGRAM: ""To add on to what he said, they're a physical team. They've got a pretty good guard in Walker, who's been averaging 20 points a game. He's tough, makes shots off the dribble, makes three-point shots. Four big men they rotate through, so they have a lot of depth and a lot of strength. They play Big Ten basketball, which is more physical.

Q. North Carolina has been an elite program forever. Michigan State more so in the last 25 years or so with Coach Izzo. I wonder how you guys think when you hear Michigan State.

HARRISON INGRAM: It's kind of a surreal moment to think about for the right to go to [the] Sweet 16 you've got to face Tom Izzo and Michigan State. They're a great team. They've had an up-and-down year. But they're a preseason top five, and they earned their right to play in the tournament. They're a really good team, and we're ready to go.

CORMAC RYAN: Two, like you said, really historic programs. Obviously really well-known in college basketball, especially over the last 25 years. So you can't ask for anything better in March Madness to go up against great teams, great programs, and come away with a great win.""

Q: What do you think of when you think of Tom Izzo basketball?

INGRAM: ""I think of rugged. I think of football type of style. Big bigs, offensive rebounding, and (getting out in) transition. He's one of the great coaches. He can coach a different style and adjust to his players and not a system. He's a great coach.""

Q. I'd like both players to address this. How much is toughness going to play into tomorrow's game, and how much do you two factor into that?

CORMAC RYAN: I think it starts and ends with toughness for us. That's something we've prided ourself on all year is living in the trenches, being tough, playing gritty, doing the dirty work, doing the little things. That's when we're at our best, and that's what fuels us. So tomorrow's no different. We've got to bring the toughness. We've got to bring the edge, bring the fight. Michigan State's a tough team and the Big Ten's a tough conference. But we're a tough team. We've shown that all year, and that's really what gets us going.""

HARRISON INGRAM: 100 percent to add on to what he said. A lot of small lineups, people playing down in their position. A lot of teams come in with the intent to try to bully us. They've done that throughout the year, they felt that was the scouting report or whatever. I feel like we've always stepped up to the challenge, and I feel like we're ready to go for tomorrow too.""

Part of stepping up to that challenge is that toughness and physicality, something that Jae'Lyn Withers believes the Tar Heels are prepared for.

WITHERS: ""At the end of the day, (physicality) is something that the ACC has been instilling and enforcing into our style of play, living in the trenches and doing the dirty work. 50/50 balls, we have to be the first ones to get to them.""

For North Carolina, an emphasis of their gameplan will be to stop Tyson Walker, who leads Michigan State in scoring at 18.2 points per game.

Elliot Cadeau on Tyson Walker:

""He looks like he's really talented. [He's] probably one of the best guards we've played so far and I learned just through film that he's really talented. We gotta play really hard to stop him. We can't let him get hot. We feel like he's probably the engine of the team and they go as far as he goes. We gotta do our best defensively from tipoff.""

RJ Davis on how to stop Walker:

""I would probably say as a team just make it tough for him to catch [the ball] and kind of just corral him on pick-and-rolls. If he gets a little bit of separation, he's able to knock it down, either from the midrange or from three. [We can] pressure him a little bit, whether that's double-teaming or off the staggers.""

""We're gonna need a lot of toughness throughout everyone, from the starting five all the way to the bench. We're gonna have to bring it. It's the second round of March Madness. It's a win or go home opportunity. We gotta be ready to play our brand of basketball.""

For RJ Davis and Armando Bacot, this isn't their first time facing off against the All-Conference guard, as Walker scored a game-high 27 points against the Tar Heels in an 82-62 loss at the Smith Center in 2021 as a member of the Northeastern program.

""It gives me and RJ some perspective because we know how much he killed us when we played him (at Northeastern),"" said Bacot. ""We know it's going to take a lot to stop him. That's going to be a great matchup with him and RJ. That's box office right there.""",northcarolina.rivals.com,news,Carolina Blue,Bryant Baucom,0.2,448851286,1,"https://images.rivals.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_large/nq8oxhw30s3k6pxh9ntc",eng-9412763

State tax revenue fell last year by 4 percent, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28 percent, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18 percent in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4 percent last year but remains 32 percent higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8 percent, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26 percent from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50 percent, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32 percent higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2 percent drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1 percent in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43 percent of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5 percent as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50 percent during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",sentinelsource.com,news,SentinelSource.com,,-0.06666666666666665,448851095,1,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7819b5a8-f0c2-11ec-85c6-cff09f7b972a.jpg?resize=600%2C315,

Here is how,"Income tax e-filing: Inoperative PAN? Still possible to file an income tax return without Aadhaar OTP verification

Income tax e-filing: If you missed linking your PAN with Aadhaar by the June 2023 deadline and your PAN is inactive, don't worry, you can still file your income tax return. The income tax department had previously clarified that an inoperative PAN remains active. The deadline for individuals not requiring an audit for the Financial Year 2023-24 (Assessment Year 2024-25) to file their Income Tax Returns (ITR) is July 31, 2024.

Abhishek Soni, CEO and Co-founder of Tax2win, explains that if you fail to link your PAN with your Aadhaar by the deadline in June 2023 and your PAN is inoperative, you can still file your income tax return.

However, Soni clarifies that the verification process won't involve Aadhaar OTP. Instead, you can utilise alternative methods such as generating an Electronic Verification Code (EVC) through net banking, ATM, or other approved means.

What is an inoperative PAN?

The PAN is said to be inoperative when it is not linked with the taxpayer's Aadhaar number.

How to file an ITR if your PAN is inoperative?

""One may pay the income taxes due and file the Income Tax Return (ITR) irrespective of PAN becoming inoperative,"" said Vijay Bharech, Director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP.

It's essential to note that the process of filing income tax returns remains the same even if your PAN is inoperative.

""You can simply log in to your account on the income tax e-filing portal and follow the steps outlined for filing income tax returns. This typically involves navigating to the e-file section, selecting the option for income tax return filing, and proceeding with the necessary details and documentation,"" explained Abhishek Soni.

Processing of Income Tax Refund

Nonetheless, an inactive PAN will lead to various repercussions. If you file an Income Tax Return (ITR) with an inactive PAN, you won't be able to claim a refund or interest on any refunds. Linking Aadhaar and PAN is compulsory for refund claims.

""The refund, if any is due, will not be issued to the taxpayer, and the interest on the refund shall be paid only from the date the PAN becomes operative,"" stated Vijay Bharech.

March 31 deadline for updated income tax returns

If you failed to submit your original income tax return (ITR), you still have the opportunity to file an updated return before March 31, 2024. Taxpayers have the option to file updated returns for any of the assessment years 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24.

However, it is important to emphasise that any additional tax owed must be paid along with the updated return.

The PCMC directed the housing society committees to snap the water connections of defaulters if they did not pay up their dues within three days. Furthermore, the PCMC asked the housing societies to post the details of the members' pending dues on WhatsApp groups and the notice board of the society. However, the Chikhali-Moshi Pimpri-Chinchwad Housing Societies' Federation (CMPCHSF), in a letter to the PCMC commissioner, said it will not cooperate in snapping individual water connections on behalf of the civic body.

Sanjeevan Sangale, chairman, CMPCHSF, said that water is a fundamental right and the PCMC cannot cut water supply for tax dues. ""The housing societies will not support the civic body in cutting tap connections. The society will not snap water connections for the PCMC and the civic body has to do it at its own expense. Also, the supply should be restored by the civic body at its own expense,"" Sangale said.

Sangale said that housing societies will not put up the pending tax dues of society members on WhatsApp groups and society notice boards as that amounts to defamation. ""The PCMC should refrain from cutting the water supply of housing societies for the tax dues of a few members. However, we won't stop the PCMC from cutting the water supply at its own expense,"" he said.

Dattatraya Deshmukh, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad Cooperative Housing Societies' Federation, said that they are against the decision taken by the PCMC. ""We will not support the civic body in its drive. Water is a basic need for a human being to survive. Just because someone is unable to pay the tax money due to some financial issue, the corporation cannot snap the water connection. We will discuss the issue with our lawyer and challenge the decision in court.""

A senior officer from the PCMC on condition of anonymity said, ""We are following the rules according to which, the civic body has the power to snap water connections, seal property and auction it for pending tax dues. We will discuss the issue with the housing society members.""

There are 1.77 lakh tax defaulters in Pimpri-Chinchwad who owe a total ₹580 crore in property tax to the PCMC. Out of the total tax dues, ₹400 crore is owed by residential properties, which is a cause for concern. Over ₹300 crore in property tax dues is owed by property owners residing in housing societies, individual houses and bungalows while ₹100 crore in property tax dues is owed by slumdwellers and the urban poor.

Advocate Mahendra Dalalkar said that water is among the fundamental rights of citizens, and the PCMC cannot snap water connections for pending tax dues. ""This can be challenged in a court of law and even the Judiciary will not support such decisions to keep any individual deprived of fundamental rights. The civic body can penalise taxpayers for the delay in payment or seek other options to clear the dues.""",hindustantimes.com,news,Hindustan Times,,0.0117647058823529,448850916,1,https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/22/1600x900/A-senior-officer-from-the-PCMC-on-condition-of-ano_1711133412232.jpg,

The indictment filed Thursday in Los Angeles federal court charges Grimes with one count of attempted tax evasion and four counts of willful failure to pay taxes. He is expected to be arraigned in downtown Los Angeles on April 10.

According to federal prosecutors, Grimes owed the Internal Revenue Service more than $1.7 million in taxes for tax years 2010 and 2014. The IRS tried to collect the unpaid taxes from Grimes by, among other things, levying his personal bank accounts.

In response to IRS collection efforts, from 2014 through 2020, Grimes allegedly engaged in a scheme to thwart the tax levies by keeping his personal bank account balances low, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Grimes deposited the money he earned from representing clients into his law firm's business bank accounts, and then he routinely purchased cashier's checks and withdrew cash from those business bank accounts, the indictment alleges. By not depositing income earned into his personal accounts, Grimes allegedly avoided IRS collection efforts, according to prosecutors.

With the alleged scheme, prosecutors say, Grimes withdrew about $16 million in funds from the business accounts in cashier's checks during those years, rather than paying the amount owed to the IRS.

Grimes also allegedly filed individual income tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021 reporting that he owed about $700,000 in taxes. Grimes allegedly did not, and has not, paid the taxes that he self-reported he owes, according to the indictment.

In total, Grimes is alleged to have caused a tax loss of over $2.4 million to the IRS.

If convicted, Grimes faces up to five years in prison for the tax evasion count and up to one year in prison for each count of willful failure to pay taxes, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.",mynewsla.com,news,My News LA,,-0.3568627450980392,448850796,1,https://i0.wp.com/mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MNLA-Facebook.jpg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1,

The revision follows nearly a year of warnings by offshore wind companies that their projects may not move forward without access to certain subsidies in U.S. President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Offshore wind is a critical part of Biden's plan to decarbonize the U.S. power grid and combat climate change.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said it would now allow an offshore wind project to claim a tax credit for siting in low-income communities if its supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment is located in such an area. SCADA systems are used to control critical infrastructure.

The energy communities tax credit is worth 10% of a project's cost and can be claimed on top of the IRA's base 30% credit for renewable energy projects.

The credit for siting projects in ""energy communities,"" defined as areas that have significant employment or tax revenues from fossil fuel industries and high unemployment, had been dictated by where a project connects to an onshore substation.

""This change reflects the fact that onshore SCADA equipment at ports is critical to offshore wind projects and that offshore wind projects make significant investments and create jobs at these ports over the duration of projects, which is the goal of the energy communities bonus,"" Treasury said in a statement.

The rules also clarify that projects with multiple points of interconnection may include any land-based power conditioning equipment to determine their eligibility for the energy communities bonus.

The Bankruptcy of Donald Trump

The so-called billionaire's inability to pay his tax fraud fines exposes his career of bombast and lies

Steven Beschloss Mar 22

He's a very, very successful businessman, a multi-billionaire, an incredible winner, he told America, with a net worth of ""well over $10 billion."" He'd been touting his winning ways for decades, well before publishing The Art of the Deal in 1987, not just when he pretended to be that capable guy on The Apprentice with the editorial trickery of TV producer Mark Burnett.

In a news interview in 2011, when he was ostensibly mulling a run for president, Donald Trump said that ""part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich. So if I need $600 million, I can put $600 million myself. That's a huge advantage. I must tell you, that's a huge advantage over the other candidates.""

Four years later, on June 16, 2015, when he descended a golden escalator and declared himself a candidate for president, he is best remembered for telling America that Mexico was sending rapists and criminals, that they were using our country as ""a dumping ground.""

But he also took plenty of time in his announcement to emphasize how rich and successful he was (even while relying on other peoples' money). He told the story of a big bank that came to him and said, ""Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion""? I said, ""I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it. But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.""

To the applause of hired extras that day, he said he has ""the greatest assets"" worth billions, including Trump Tower (725 5th Avenue), the Neuberger Berman building (1290 Avenue of the Americas) and the Trump Building (40 Wall Street) in New York City and the Bank of America building (555 California Street) in San Francisco. ""I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not,"" Trump said. ""I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.""

And what is that opposite thinking? ""We have losers. We have losers,"" Trump said. ""We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.""

Oh, the bombast, the scapegoating, the self-assurance from the nation's top confidence man (con man, that is), who, to no surprise, refused to release his tax returns.

This Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James may begin to seize some of those great assets in order to cover fines of $464 million and counting that he owes (and apparently is not rich enough to pay) after losing his tax fraud case. Some financial and legal experts suggest his best option to secure the necessary bond while he appeals -- now that over 30 surety companies that could cover his bond refused -- is to declare bankruptcy.

It's a strategy Trump knows well with six previous bankruptcies, including three Atlantic City casinos buried in debt he couldn't manage. Yet somehow those bankruptcies failed to register with enough voters when they were assessing the quality of this self-described success story.

But The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Trump is loath to declare bankruptcy this time since it might send the wrong message to voters assessing his business acumen and financial worth. ""Even though bankruptcy could alleviate his immediate cash crunch,"" the Post noted, ""it also carries risks for a candidate who has marketed himself as a winning businessman -- and whose greatest appeal to voters, some advisers say, is his financial success.""

In other words, declaring bankruptcy would not be simply a legal and financial strategy to buy him time, it would be a loud and clear message of the bankruptcy of the bill of goods he's been dishing out all these years. A winner, a top businessman, a multi-billionaire can't come up with half a billion to avoid financial disaster? Is his penthouse apartment -- including the toilet -- not really covered in gold? Might some of his followers comprehend, heaven forbid, that he's been lying to them? Could a few even begin to wonder why they have to keep sending him money to pay his legal bills?

As one of those close to Trump told the Post, ""He'd rather have Letitia James show up with the sheriff at 40 Wall and make a huge stink about it than say he's bankrupt...Bankruptcy doesn't play well for him, but having her try to take his properties might.""

In a 2017 Economist/Yougov poll, 55 percent of Americans said they believed Trump was a successful businessman, including a third of Democrats. By 2019, in a Politico/Morning Consult poll, that view had changed little, as 54 percent still said they thought he was successful in business, including 85 percent of Republicans.

But after respondents in that same 2019 poll learned that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses from 1985 to 1994 -- thanks to an exhaustive investigation by The New York Times armed with Internal Revenue Service documents -- the percentage who believed in his business success dropped 11 points to 43 percent.

Exit polls from the GOP primaries have found that roughy a third of Republican voters say they think Trump is not fit to be president if he's convicted of a crime. For many of us who think a man with 91 felony charges should not be nominated for president, that has made the possibility of trial delays that extend beyond the November election that much more maddening.

But perhaps in the coming weeks, if AG James begins padlocking some buildings or otherwise demonstrating that the so-called billionaire is not such a winner after all, some of the pro-Trump crowd (albeit not the impenetrable cultists) might begin to reset their gaze. Maybe, just maybe, the cries of political persecution will strike a few Republicans and a growing number of independents as the sad whines of a bankrupt man. Because, in America, people like winners -- and when the odor of loser grows thicker, the crowds turn away.

A rural farmer once visited his banker brother in the city. The man had heard about his younger brother's new house and wanted to see it for himself. He also had another agenda.

With mouth agape, he marvelled at the beautifully crafted POP ceilings, mighty chandeliers, and expensive-looking leather furniture. His feet sank deep into the lush Turkish carpets, and for an instant, he wondered if it was possible for the rug to fit into his ghana-must-go travelling bag. No one would miss it, he was sure. There was plenty more where it came from.

The brothers greeted each other, and the older farmer started by thanking the younger brother for his generosity. Their parents were well taken care of. Their sister's new hairdressing saloon. His children's school fees. Had he heard about his wife's illness? She was diagnosed with something called 'goitre'. She would require money for the surgery. Additionally, the sickness had made her fat and gloomy and averse towards her wifely duties. Was it possible that his brother could sponsor his marriage to a second wife? That should not be a big deal considering all he (the banker) had spent on his new house. Remember Umar? My second son? -yes! he sends his regards. He also wants you to send him to Malaysia for his master's degree. That is where your son is, ko? Yauwa, they will be together and keep an eye on each other. These children! But please, don't forget the issue of my marriage. You know it is not healthy for a man to stay without a wife, abi? Yauwa!

The banker tells his brother that he does not have money to give him. While they are talking, lamb pepper soup is served. The farmer looks at the huge meat parts and argues with his banker brother. How can he say that he does not have money, when just this morning, a ram was slaughtered in the house?

The banker looks his older brother dead in the eye and replies: 'I did not say I do not have money. I said I do not have money to give you to add another wife.'

The farmer leaves the next day. But not without begging his brother's wife for the carpet in the living room. The banker gives him transport fare, bids him farewell and from then on, stops picking his calls.

Growing up, many Nigerians witnessed their parents helping out their relatives. Whether it was their grand-parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins and even far-fetched relatives whose relationship was so weak, it could be described as simply sharing a compound with his father's brother's uncle.

We grew up watching these financial exchanges of one person renovating the family home, caring for parents, paying school fess for siblings and later their children, supporting a n'er do well brother who has refused to get a job and has become a nuisance to the family or a sister whose husband has refused to take responsibility for his children.

Every African knows these stories. It's called 'black tax'.

The Black tax, a term that originated in South Africa, is the financial responsibility placed on family members who experience upward mobility to help out their less fortunate relatives. The successful person is often the first in a poor family to graduate from college or attain a high-paying job. A deep-seated sense of responsibility towards familial obligations often drives this financial assistance.

This type of tax refers to the financial burden borne by Black people who have achieved a level of success and who provide support to less financially secure family members. These monetary transfers are generally made between middle-class and well-to-do Black people and relatives who are struggling to make ends meet.

In the actual sense, black tax was supposed to be a positive thing, initially meant to propel African families out of poverty. However, most Africans would argue that it has become a burden weighing on their happiness and livelihood.

As we grow older, most of us will inherit the black tax of our parents. However, it is becoming clearer everyday, due to hyperinflation and the unstable economy that we may not have the financial, mental, and physical capacity to live up to our parents' burden.

The calls for rent, school fees, a wife in labour, a child in hospital, marriage rites and capital for a business start-up are responsibilities that this generation can simply not bear.

Hear me out.

In a recent interview, John Mikel Obi, the former captain of the Nigerian Super Eagles, discussed various aspects of his football career, comprising his time at Chelsea, a thwarted transfer to Manchester United, and his experiences playing for the Nigerian senior national team. Mikel's discourse on the ""black tax"" phenomenon resonated deeply with a cross-section of the Nigerian middle class and has ignited a debate.

Mikel Obi discussed the challenges associated with the black tax, highlighting the burden of finding the balance between pursuing personal ambitions and satisfying financial demands that often come with a disturbing sense of entitlement. He describes instances where extended family members, who are previously unknown, often leverage familial connections for personal gain and selfish interests and even threaten the 'payer' when such tries to deny those requests. He explained how some relatives feel their lives are sorted because of their affiliation with him, highlighting how some of them with large families implicitly designate him as the caretaker for their offspring.

There are many reasons why this generation cannot continue with these financial obligations.

First of all, in these times of poverty, it is cruel to assume that other people should shoulder your responsibility. Worldwide, people are complaining of the financial crisis and therefore it would be foolhardy to think that somebody else will shoulder your responsibility. High cost of school fees? Change schools. Rent? Change house. Marriage, shelve the idea. Hospital bills? Invest in your state contributory health insurance scheme. It caters to both civil servants and unskilled workers.

Secondly, while black tax is seemingly beneficial to those who are struggling, it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the individual to not only maintain their status financially, but to grow it with very few resources which can increase financial stress or financial anxiety. A typical example is the story of the man in Kogi who erroneously received money in his account. Instead of seeking an explanation from the bank, the guy went ahead to start raining money on his relatives to the point of paying for lesser Hajj for them.

The pressure to do more for relatives is a contributing factor to fraud. Because like one politician confessed- 'How can I help all my relatives with only my salary? These are people who look up to me. How will they believe me when I tell them I don't have the resources?'

The 'Black Tax' can be particularly overwhelming when you add in financial trauma to the mix. A high income doesn't necessarily equate to a strong understanding of money management or financial psychology. The pressure to demonstrate wealth, hide wealth, or simply give it all away can lead those who have achieved a level of financial success down a path to financial ruin. This not only has an impact on the individual but on dependants and future generations through the disruption of intergenerational wealth transfer, contributing to an already wide wealth gap.

Pfluger spoke on the House Floor in advance of the vote.

""I rise in support of H.R. 1023, the Cutting Green Corruption and Taxes Act. I am proud that H.R. 1023 includes my legislation, H.R. 1141, to repeal the IRA's natural gas tax.

""The natural gas tax is inappropriate and highly unworkable. This tax was included despite never being considered in a hearing, receiving expert testimony, and, instead of looking at emissions holistically, the natural gas tax was based on the simple premise that if reliable energy is taxed, less of it will be produced.

""Especially as the EPA rolls out proposed rules to implement the natural gas tax, it is clear that Congress must take action to repeal this looming regulatory morass that targets all operators, no matter the size or actual emissions.

""I was pleased to host Speaker Johnson out to the Permian Basin to kick off Energy Week. The Speaker had the opportunity to meet with independent oil and gas producers who have worked proactively to reduce emissions.

""They haven't invested millions in emissions reduction technologies because of government penalties -- they have done it because it makes economic and environmental sense for them to do so. In fact, methane emissions intensity in the Permian dropped nearly 70 percent between 2011 and 2020, even as production rose by over 320 percent. Permian producers are diligently and responsibly leading the way.

""If implemented, the ill-conceived natural gas tax will handicap technological innovation, reduce supplies of affordable energy, and increase both costs and emissions. In fact, this tax alone will drive up the cost of household energy bills for the 180 million Americans and 5.5 million businesses that rely on natural gas.

""The underpinnings of our national security and economic prosperity rest on the abundant natural resources the United States boasts. Now more than ever, it is critical to prioritize our energy security and dominance by repealing the IRA's natural gas tax.",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.1686274509803922,448848712,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,eng-9419475

(WKRN) -- Tennessee's franchise tax on businesses is based on their property in the state.

But a new bill from Governor Bill Lee's office is set to do two things - refund businesses back three years who have paid a franchise tax and then also cut the tax moving forward.

It's over a billion dollars for the refund and about $400 million each year after that.

""This is the right solution for the problem that was presented to us as a state,"" Gov. Bill Lee (R-Tennessee) said. ""This solution that we have put out there as a framework is the right way forward.""

Thursday, the Senate passed the initiative.

The move incensed Senate Democrats, saying they don't understand how this is a conservative fiscal decision.

""What happened today was a departure from long-standing practice and norms in this body to be fiscally responsible, to ensure that we're being fully deliberate and have a sound basis for how we allocate taxpayer dollars,"" Sen. Jeff Yarbro (D-Nashville) said.

But Senate Republicans say paying a lot upfront now will protect the state from fees from future potential lawsuits.

""Nobody likes it. Nobody likes having to vote for this, nobody likes having to do this,"" Sen. Bo Watson (R-Hixson) said. ""But in terms of being the best remedy that courts would look at, this is a reasonable solution anybody moving forward really doesn't have any kind of basis for a challenge to the state on this.""

The bill has yet to even begin the committee process in the House. In fact, the House has a different version of the same bill.

""The similar part will be the $400 million tax cut,"" Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton (R-Crossville) said. ""The other part will not be similar.""

It's the latest inconsistency between the two chambers, as they are facing different versions or disagreements on the education voucher scholarship bill, several LGBTQ+ bills, and Tennessee State University.

When Senate leaders were asked about the House's ideas around the franchise tax, they seemed frustrated by a lack of communication.

""We don't speak for the House,"" Watson said.

Inverclyde was the one of the last council areas in Scotland to agree to the council tax freeze, with an agreement being reached earlier this week.

Along with Argyll and Bute, the local authority initially sought to defy the Scottish Government's bid to freeze the levy but an agreement was reached earlier this week.

Inverclyde Council leader, Labour's Stephen McCabe, said the decision to go along with the Government's policy was made reluctantly.

The policy of maintaining council tax at current levels was made by Mr Yousaf at the SNP conference last October.

It led to months of negotiations between the government and councils on how much they should be compensated.

Poverty campaigners have said the freeze offers little to low-income families but the First Minister has said it will help households with the cost of living.

Ahead of the visit to Inverclyde, Mr Yousaf said: ""In October last year I promised a national council tax freeze for households across Scotland and that is what the SNP is delivering.

""Despite Labour's attempts to stop people in Inverclyde from receiving this support, I am delighted that we are succeeding in delivering it.

""Council tax bills will be effectively frozen in all 32 local authorities next year.

""Council tax bills in Scotland are already hundreds of pounds a year lower than they are in England and this fully-funded council tax freeze gives people even more relief whilst they grapple with increased costs.""

He added: ""So while Westminster is forcing people to pay the price of broken Brexit Britain and economic mismanagement, the SNP is taking action where we can to protect household budgets.

""In stark contrast to the Tories and Labour Party, the SNP is tackling the cost-of-living crisis, investing in our public services and mitigating against the worst of Westminster's cuts.""",heraldscotland.com,news,The Herald,Kathleen Nutt,0.2627450980392156,448848378,1,https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/16621277/,eng-9407074

Now, engineers from the University of Michigan have made a big leap in how we might make plastics, adhesives, and even rubber gloves in the future.

They've designed a new type of chemical reactor that could significantly lower the cost of making propylene, a crucial ingredient in a wide range of products, by using natural gas instead of oil.

Today, propylene is mostly obtained as a byproduct when crude oil is refined into gasoline. It's a key component not just in plastics and household cleaners, but also in making the nitrile rubber used in car parts and the blue protective gloves you might see doctors wearing.

However, as the world moves away from oil and gasoline in favor of cleaner energy sources like natural gas, wind, and solar power, there's a concern that we won't have enough propylene to meet demand.

Natural gas, especially the type extracted from shale, is a promising alternative source because it contains propane, which is very similar to propylene.

But until now, turning propane into propylene wasn't efficient or cost-effective due to technical challenges.

High temperatures were needed for the conversion, which not only produced unwanted byproducts but also solid carbon deposits that clogged up the catalysts used in the reaction.

Cleaning these out regularly made the process too inefficient to be worth it.

The University of Michigan team's breakthrough comes with a reactor that cleverly separates propane into propylene and hydrogen gas.

This not only increases the amount of propylene produced but also solves the problem of the unwanted byproducts and carbon build-up.

The reactor uses a special design with nested, hollow-fiber membranes that allow the hydrogen gas to escape and be burned separately, providing the necessary heat for the reaction without the downsides of the old methods.

This innovative setup means that plants could produce propylene directly from natural gas without the need for additional heating equipment.

The researchers estimate that a plant producing 500,000 metric tons of propylene yearly could save as much as $23.5 million by switching to this new method.

Plus, the hydrogen that's produced and burned off in the process is a cleaner fuel than other options, adding another environmental benefit.

In summary, this new reactor technology not only makes it cheaper and more efficient to produce an important chemical used in a vast array of everyday products but also offers a more environmentally friendly alternative to current methods.

As we continue to look for sustainable solutions in all areas of production, innovations like this are crucial steps toward a cleaner, more cost-effective future.",knowridge.com,news,Knowridge Science Report,,0.1764705882352942,448848148,1,https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/A-new-reactor-turns-natural-gas-into-key-ingredient-and-saves-millions.jpg,eng-9419210

The gift card industry in India will continue to grow over the forecast period and is expected to record a CAGR of 15.3% during 2024-2028. Gift card market in the country will increase from US$7.6 billion in 2023 to reach US$15.7 billion by 2028.

The gift card market is poised to record strong growth in India over the medium term. The rising adoption of the payment tool, especially among consumers from Tier II and III cities, is aiding the industry growth. Consumers in Tier II cities and beyond are increasingly adopting gift cards as a gifting and payment tool. In India, digital gift cards are more popular compared to physical ones among consumers.

To tap into the high-growth market, more digital platforms are launching gift card solutions to meet the demand among Indian consumers. E-commerce platforms have also reported strong gift card sales in 2023. This trend is expected to continue further in 2024 in the Indian market. Overall, the publisher maintains a positive growth outlook for the Indian gift card sector over the next three to four years.

Amid rising adoption more digital platforms are launching gift card solutions for consumers and corporations

The rising preference for gift cards is evident in the fast-growing competitive landscape in the Indian market. More players have started to offer gift card solutions to consumers and corporates over the last 12 months and this trend is projected to continue further over the medium term.

The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), in September 2023, launched the ONDC Network Gift Card. The network-level gift card is targeted towards corporates as well as consumers. Unlike traditional brand-specific gift cards, the ONDC Network Gift Card provides consumers with a choice to choose from a vast range of products and brands, spanning different categories such as fashion, electronics, food, and others.

The gift card solution was launched just before the Indian festive season, which is one of the biggest contributors towards total gift card sales over the 12 months. The Network Gift Card also aligns well with the ONDC's ambition of democratizing digital commerce in India. The gift cards are powered by the RuPay Network and can be loaded with a maximum of INR 10,000.

ONDC, in November 2023, recorded 1.2 million transactions during the festive season. This shows the growing popularity of the platform among Indian consumers. In 2024, ONDC is poised to expand in more Indian cities. This will aid the penetration of gift cards in Tier II and beyond cities over the next three to four years in the Indian market, thereby supporting the market growth too.

Gift card is still a small portion of a multi-billion-dollar gifting industry in India

The gifting industry in India is one of the largest globally. From weddings to festivals, gift-giving is the traditional process followed across the nation. Gift cards still represent a tiny portion of the multi-billion-dollar gifting industry. This is also seen in the revenue generated through gift card sales by providers in India.

IGP, an online multi-category gifting platform, revealed that gift cards constituted only 10% of its total business during the 2023 festive season. The firm has further revealed that corporate and personalized gifting sectors have been growing at a significant rate in India. IGP reported a 20% year-on-year expansion in the corporate gifting segment during the 2023 Indian festive season. The personalized gifting market, on the other hand, reported 25% growth year-on-year.

The fact that gift cards only constituted 10% of IGP's total revenue during the festival season shows that there is plenty of headroom for growth for providers in the Indian market. With adoption still growing at a significant pace, the growth opportunity will drive more global players into the Indian market, thereby aiding the competitive landscape over the medium term.

The Indian government is considering some relief from GST on gift cards and vouchers

The government, in India, is considering offering relief from goods and services tax (GST) on gift cards and vouchers provided by businesses and merchants. The relief aims to solve the problem of double taxation in certain cases. The decision is expected to provide clear guidelines on how these widely-used payment tools are taxed.

To address this issue, the proposed clarification suggests exempting vouchers and gift cards from sales tax. Additionally, the government also seeks to establish how companies' vouchers, traded or sold to distributors or dealers, should be taxed. Another issue under consideration, by the Indian government, is the levy of tax on the entire face value of the vouchers rather than simply the commission, as is the practice in the industry when vouchers are transferred.

""If you look at the way states are growing, the states that are really thriving are the eight or ten states, whatever it is, that have no personal income, income tax,"" Former Indiana State Representative Mike Murphy (R) said.

The SALTR (State and Local Tax Reform) Task Force will submit its final recommendations to the General Assembly before the next session (the committee's deadline this year's end). However, it's unclear if those will include eliminating the State Income Tax and if lawmakers will even agree with those proposals.

""When I was in the legislature for 16 years, I never once voted for a bill because it was recommended by a summer study committee,"" Murphy said.

""A lot of times, those study committees end up sitting on a shelf during the legislative period -- that is not a surprise,"" Former Indiana State Rep. Terri Austin (D) said. ""It's not like people take those recommendations and run to the bank with them, so...that's a waste of taxpayer dollars and legislator time, quite honestly.""

As for bills surrounding marijuana legalization, ballot initiatives, and gun control, Austin said she does not expect any to get a hearing next session.

""Never under this supermajority,"" Austin said. ""Never.""

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",canoncitydailyrecord.com,news,Canon City Daily Record,,0.05882352941176472,448847297,1,https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

The group, founded and led by former New York Times journalist Julie Scelfo, is called MAMA -- Mothers Against Media Addiction. They wore neon green beanies and held signs that said ""#KidsBeforeTech."" Many of its members, some of whom lost children after being exposed to harms through social media, had demonstrated in January during the U.S. Senate hearings around Big Tech and child safety. During the hearing, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg turned to them and said, ""I'm sorry for everything you've all gone through.""

""He actually looked me in the eyes for a few minutes and I thought 'You have no idea who I am,'"" Scelfo told NBC News in an interview after the rally, referring to Zuckerberg's acknowledgement of grieving parents during the Senate hearings. ""And who I am is someone who has for years been asking people to think more critically about how all these technologies are wreaking havoc with basic institutions in our democracy.""

The issues discussed by parents and child safety advocates at the Friday rally extended far beyond the aims of the New York state bills, with actress and author Sheetal Sheth, a MAMA member and event speaker, calling them the ""bare minimum"" of regulating Big Tech.

One parent, Mary Rodee, was holding a picture of her late son Riley, who died by suicide at age 15 in 2021 after being targeted with online sextortion on Facebook, she said.

""Nothing has changed in nearly three years since Riley's death,"" Rodee said.

Meta referred NBC News to its participation with the ""Take It Down"" initiative, introduced in 2023 alongside the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which provides aid to children who are being sexually extorted or have had intimate material featuring them posted online. Meta also pointed to its guidance for kids and parents around sextortion, its stricter standards for minors on Facebook Messenger and its Safety Notices within Instagram direct messages.

The two New York Senate bills were introduced by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who spoke at the protest. The bills are still waiting to advance from Senate committee. One is called the ""Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act"" and the other is called the New York child data protection act.

The ""SAFE"" act would require social media platforms to opt children out of algorithmic-driven feeds -- which it calls ""addictive"" -- and instead present chronological feeds of posts from accounts children follow, minus algorithm-suggested content. It would also prevent social media platforms from sending children notifications between midnight and 6 a.m. The New York child data protection act would prohibit online sites from ""collecting, using, sharing, or otherwise processing any personal data of individuals under the age of 18 without informed consent.""

Both bills would limit how social media companies can administer their products to children in New York state, as well as how those companies can profit from child users. The ""SAFE'' act would require social media companies to ""provide age verification methods all New Yorkers can use"" that do not collect biometric data or require government identification ""that many New Yorkers do not possess."" The child data protection act would not require age verification, but would instead require companies to rely on ""browser or device signals"" that indicate a user is a minor.

""This country is so far behind other countries in ensuring basic regulations,"" Scelfo said, referring to various laws that have been passed in Europe regulating social media platforms.

In the U.S., various pieces of proposed regulation on social media companies have failed or languished in Congress.

MAMA and the New York state bills the group is advocating for are part of a movement of proposed and enacted social media regulation at the state level, where advocates of Big Tech regulation have seen more success. For example, in Florida, a controversial state bill that would ban social media for kids under 16 even if they had their parents' permission passed the House in February. That bill contains similar language to the less restrictive New York bills, as well as similar proposals and laws in states like Arkansas, Texas, Ohio, New Jersey and California.

The Washington Post reported that MAMA is financially backed by the Center for Humane Technology nonprofit, which was behind the 2020 documentary ""The Social Dilemma."" The nonprofit has also advocated for the Kids Online Safety Act, federal legislation that proposes new obligations for social media companies to prevent children from being exposed to content deemed harmful. Critics say this bill threatens kids' First Amendment rights and puts the power to censor the internet in the hands of partisan state officials.

Big Tech companies and researchers have also challenged the idea that social media can be addictive, which is at the heart of the proposed ""SAFE"" act in New York City. While addiction is in MAMA's name, Scelfo said the group isn't making medical claims.

""I'm not a doctor, and MAMA is not using the word addiction in a clinical sense. However, we are using it to communicate the overarching problem in our society's addiction to media and technology,"" she said.

""We have screens everywhere now. And because of the internet and 24-hour, endless streams of content, we are inundating people's minds and hearts with more information than they can possibly process. We have screens in elevators, we have screens in waiting rooms, in restaurants, at gas pumps, and it is not good for human health.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,Kat Tenbarge,-0.0980392156862745,448846833,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hGoCRN9m6.9gFZdXg1itvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/4678bdca891c6edee6c0badf1dbbe291,

Katie Porter doesn't rule out running for office again, calls TikTok legislation 'hasty'","(Inside California Politics) -- Rep. Katie Porter (D) may have lost her race for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by the late Dianne Feinstein, but she said she is not done with this election cycle.

The Orange County representative spoke with Inside California Politics about the reaction to her concession statement and her plans for the rest of her time in Congress.

The text of the interview below has been slightly adjusted for clarity.

Nikki Laurenzo: Congresswoman Porter, I want to start by asking you about the news that you made this week, clarifying some comments that you posted on Twitter post-election a couple of weeks ago. It was the use of the word ""rigged,"" and obviously, that caused a lot of blowback. There were some comparisons made to former President Donald Trump because that's the word he used in terms of his 2020 election loss. You said on the podcast ""Pod Save America"" for our viewers who didn't see that or hear it that you wish you would have used a different word. Why is that? And did you anticipate the response to it?

Rep. Katie Porter: Well, clearly the response kind of obscured, I think, the point I was making which is that outside election spending, particularly spending that is not disclosed before the election and super PAC spending to the tune of millions does manipulate and distort and affect our election system.

As I said in my statements immediately following the election, and as I said, following every election, I have never doubted and do not doubt the incredible integrity and hard work of our election officials. I have gratitude for them, for their work to count every vote. Although the outcome wasn't what I wanted here, every Californian should have complete confidence in our election officials. But that can be true at the same time another thing is true, which is that big money in our politics is a big problem.

Laurenzo: I want to point out too that you and other progressive Democrats have used words like rigged in the past to describe the economy, your mentor Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders.

So you know, words like that aren't uncommon, but in our current environment, they can cause a sparked reaction like we saw here. But I want to ask you too, now that you've had some time -- a few weeks to decompress -- and look back at your race. What's your takeaway? Any regrets that you have?

Rep. Porter: Well, look, we got outspent three to one, particularly by super PAC money. I suffered with $10 million of negative spending against me and was the only candidate who had negative attacks (against) them on air. That's always tough. I think it's tough to overcome. I'm glad that I ran the race. I did focus on issues like affordable housing bringing down costs for California families, and the need to shake up how we do things in Washington.

Look, when I started this race, I was the first candidate to launch, and I had a track record of never taking corporate PAC money. I think that helped move the other candidates in the race, including our Democratic nominee, Adam Schiff, to make the decision to also not take corporate PAC money. That's a good decision he's made and I commend him for it.

Laurenzo: Will you be helping him campaign or putting out an endorsement of any kind?

Rep. Porter: Well, I had a very pleasant exchange with Representative Schiff, and of course, I've seen him in Washington since. But I called and congratulated him. He sent me a lovely text message back. We've been colleagues, Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and I throughout this race. And so I'm excited to see the race continue. I'm very concerned about the policies that Steve Garvey expressed. Clearly, Adam Schiff is the right choice for California. Right now I've been focusing a lot on trying to help some of our other California candidates, raising money also for Joe Biden, but also for candidates like Dave Min, who's running in the seat that I'm currently in. Will Rollins, who's running against Ken Calvert, making sure that we're winning the House of Representatives back for Democrats.

Laurenzo: So there are a lot of questions surrounding your political future. You know the political consultant class likes to play the game of ""maybe this could happen"" and throw out those scenarios. One proposal was -- it even happened on our show a couple of weeks ago -- that you could potentially be a candidate for governor here in California. Are you interested in that?

Rep. Porter: Well, what I'm focusing on right now is continuing to do my job. I have lots of months left of serving Californians, and I've been working hard this week, having hearings about the oversight of foreign aid that we give to other countries, and a hearing about influence peddling in Congress. So I'm working to put together, hopefully, what will be a bipartisan piece of legislation that can help address those issues. I've also been doing a lot of planning for things that I'm gonna be able to do in my district to continue to represent my constituents. So that's where my focus is now, as well as on my three children.

Laurenzo: OK, so that's not a no. Let's say a Republican takes your Congressional seat and Dave Min is not successful... Would you rule out running for that seat again?

Rep. Porter: Well, I'm going to be out there knocking on doors all summer to make sure that Dave Min wins the seat. He had a strong win in the primary and look, Orange County has more registered Democrats than Republicans. This is a seat that we can hold.

Scott Bob's track record as a lobbyist lawbreaker is well known. California voters and Orange County voters had the chance to learn about that last cycle.

So my job is really to continue to help Democrats win up and down the ballot. That was going be what I was going to be doing if I had been successful in the Senate race, that's what I'm gonna be doing, even given that I wasn't successful.

Laurenzo: I want to ask you about TikTok, because this has been in the news. Legislation introduced made it out of the House and into the Senate right now where it seems to be stalled, and you are not for an outright ban of TikTok. Why is that?

Rep. Porter: Well, to be clear, the legislation that the House considered would have given TikTok a choice: either divest and sell from the Chinese owner ByteDance to an American-owned entity or cease to operate. So it wasn't a ban, it was a choice and if they didn't choose to sell to a U.S. subsidiary then they wouldn't have been able to operate.

Part of the reason I voted no on the legislation is that it was very, very hasty and we have not taken the time as representatives of the American people, to explain to our constituents what are the concerns about foreign ownership of media, including social media. Those are very, very real concerns.

I anticipate that there will be more legislation in this area going forward and I think we have to take both the national security concerns as well as the concerns about the influence of our democracy very, very seriously.

But we have to bring the American people along in that conversation and make sure that we're designing a bill that can actually work to achieve its intended outcome, which is to reduce the potential for foreign interference in our social media while preserving the ability for people to use a product in an app that they find useful.

Laurenzo: Congresswoman Katie Porter, as always, we appreciate your time here on Inside California Politics.",ktla.com,news,KTLA 5,Jacque Porter,0.03529411764705892,448846346,1,https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/03/GettyImages-1659530903.jpg?strip=1&w=640,

The scheme, which was run out of a prison in California, federal officials said, attempted to fraudulently claim more than half a billion dollars in tax refunds.

The method was a familiar one: erroneous claims of the Employee Retention Tax Credit.

The IRS said on Friday that it was intensifying its efforts to root out such cases of fraud and attempted fraud as it tried to safeguard taxpayer money, but it acknowledged that without an intervention by Congress, the agency would continue to be flooded with potentially improper claims.

One of the most brazen cases connected to the program emerged in February, when federal agents announced charges against a man they called the ringleader of a fraud operation, Kristopher Thomas, a former gang member who was already serving prison time for murder. He was charged along with seven co-conspirators outside prison, including his mother, who were helping to carry out the plan, authorities said.

The joint investigation by the FBI and the criminal investigation unit of the IRS was called ""Operation Fraud Street Mafia."" It involved intercepted calls and text messages exchanging information about fake businesses while using the money they made to live luxuriously - even flying on a private jet to a party in Las Vegas.

The alleged plot is perhaps the most egregious example of the abuse of a tax benefit that was created during the throes of the pandemic to keep businesses and their workers afloat. Since the program's inception in 2020, a new industry of tax preparation firms has popped up just to process claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which allows businesses to collect up to $26,000 for each employee on its payroll.

But the program has been rife with fraud, with many of the wrongdoers being tax prep firms luring businesses to apply for tax credits that they are not qualified to receive. As a result, the program has cost the federal government billions more than originally estimated.

Taxpayers can continue to apply for the tax credit through 2025, but the IRS paused the program last September so that it could sift through a backlog of claims and step up audits. Lawmakers in Congress have been negotiating over tax legislation that would shut the program down early, potentially saving the federal government approximately $80 billion, but an agreement has yet to be reached.

The IRS said Friday since it temporarily stopped accepting applications for the credits last fall and offered taxpayers the chance to withdraw their claims, it has protected more than $1 billion in federal tax revenue. However, the agency warned the program remains a problem and that it still had about 1 million unprocessed claims.

""We remain deeply concerned about widespread abuse involving these claims that have harmed small businesses,"" Daniel Werfel, the IRS commissioner, said in a statement.

Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers on Friday to end the tax credit program.

""Congress must act to protect the interests of U.S. taxpayers and honest small businesses and give the IRS the tools it needs to tackle fraud,"" he said.

Since last September, 1,800 businesses withdrew claims totaling $251 million. The IRS said that during the last six months it has also caught 12,000 businesses filing more than 22,000 claims that were improper, resulting in $572 million in penalties.

The pot of a seemingly limitless amount of pandemic relief money led tax preparation firms to embark on a blitz of advertising to persuade businesses to apply for the credits, yielding them lucrative commissions.

In the case of Thomas, the court documents showed that he and his associates filed approximately 300 payroll tax returns that claimed over $550 million in refunds that were largely associated with the Employee Retention Tax Credit.

Officials said that the returns were for ""fake business entities, actual businesses with overstated wages and numbers of employees, and businesses that were defunct at the time the payroll tax returns were filed."" Much of the money that they sought was not refunded because the IRS suspected fraud.

The case demonstrated a striking level of recklessness. At one point in 2023, Thomas was heard speaking on a recorded jail line with his mother about her concerns that the federal government would catch on to what they were doing, officials have said.",nytlicensing.com,news,Spokesman.com,,-0.3333333333333334,448846296,1,https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,

The gift card industry in Saudi Arabia will continue to grow over the forecast period and is expected to record a CAGR of 7.4% during 2024-2028. Gift card market in the country will increase from US$1.5 billion in 2023 to reach US$2.2 billion by 2028.

The gift card market is poised to record strong growth over the medium term in Saudi Arabia. Improved digital payments infrastructure and the thriving e-commerce market are among the factors aiding gift card industry growth in the Kingdom. The publisher expects the adoption of gift cards to increase further in 2024, supporting the growth of the industry over the medium term.

In 2024, new players are also expected to enter the market, as the demand continues to grow, especially in the digital gift card segment. Retailers are also partnering with gift card providers to launch innovative programs. This will aid the competitive landscape in the sector over the medium term. Overall, the publisher maintains a positive growth outlook for the gift card market over the next three to four years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Retailers are entering into strategic collaboration with providers to launch gift card solutions

The demand for gift cards is poised to grow even further among consumers in the Kingdom over the medium term. To tap into this growing demand, retailers are forging strategic alliances with gift card providers to launch their own solutions.

eXtra, the leading consumer electronics and home appliance maker in the Kingdom, partnered with YouGotaGift in September 2023. As part of the collaboration, eXtra is using YOUProcess, a new omnichannel gift card processing solution, to launch a branded gift card program in Saudi Arabia. The YOUProcess gift card program will enable consumers to buy and use gift cards across all eXtra stores.

The strategic collaboration will enable YouGotaGift to further strengthen its position in the fast-growing gift card market in the Kingdom. Going forward, the publisher expects more retailers to partner with YouGotaGift. This will support the growth of the broader gift card market in Saudi Arabia from the short to medium-term perspective.

Online gifting platforms are foraying into the gift card sector to diversify revenue growth in 2024

The demand for gift cards, especially digital ones, is set to rise significantly over the medium term in the Kingdom. Consequently, online gifting platforms are entering the gift card market to diversify their revenue stream.

FNP.ae, one of the leading online gifting solutions providers, entered into a strategic partnership with Merit Incentives, a global firm specializing in engagement technology and solutions. This partnership, announced in October 2023, is a big step for FNP as it diversifies its product offerings and revenue stream, bringing FNP gift cards to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Alongside the Kingdom, FNP also launched the gift card service in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The FNP gift cards are made available in various denominations through the Merit Incentives gift card platform.

Going forward, the publisher expects more gifting platforms to foray into the gift card category. The entry of new players in the sector is driving innovation and a competitive landscape in the market. This will subsequently support the growth of the gift card market over the next three to four years.

Katie Porter doesn't rule out running for office again, calls TikTok legislation 'hasty'","(Inside California Politics) -- Rep. Katie Porter (D) may have lost her race for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by the late Dianne Feinstein, but she said she is not done with this election cycle.

The Orange County representative spoke with Inside California Politics about the reaction to her concession statement and her plans for the rest of her time in Congress.

The text of the interview below has been slightly adjusted for clarity.

Nikki Laurenzo: Congresswoman Porter, I want to start by asking you about the news that you made this week, clarifying some comments that you posted on Twitter post-election a couple of weeks ago. It was the use of the word ""rigged,"" and obviously, that caused a lot of blowback. There were some comparisons made to former President Donald Trump because that's the word he used in terms of his 2020 election loss. You said on the podcast ""Pod Save America"" for our viewers who didn't see that or hear it that you wish you would have used a different word. Why is that? And did you anticipate the response to it?

Rep. Katie Porter: Well, clearly the response kind of obscured, I think, the point I was making which is that outside election spending, particularly spending that is not disclosed before the election and super PAC spending to the tune of millions does manipulate and distort and affect our election system.

As I said in my statements immediately following the election, and as I said, following every election, I have never doubted and do not doubt the incredible integrity and hard work of our election officials. I have gratitude for them, for their work to count every vote. Although the outcome wasn't what I wanted here, every Californian should have complete confidence in our election officials. But that can be true at the same time another thing is true, which is that big money in our politics is a big problem.

Laurenzo: I want to point out too that you and other progressive Democrats have used words like rigged in the past to describe the economy, your mentor Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders.

So you know, words like that aren't uncommon, but in our current environment, they can cause a sparked reaction like we saw here. But I want to ask you too, now that you've had some time -- a few weeks to decompress -- and look back at your race. What's your takeaway? Any regrets that you have?

Rep. Porter: Well, look, we got outspent three to one, particularly by super PAC money. I suffered with $10 million of negative spending against me and was the only candidate who had negative attacks (against) them on air. That's always tough. I think it's tough to overcome. I'm glad that I ran the race. I did focus on issues like affordable housing bringing down costs for California families, and the need to shake up how we do things in Washington.

Look, when I started this race, I was the first candidate to launch, and I had a track record of never taking corporate PAC money. I think that helped move the other candidates in the race, including our Democratic nominee, Adam Schiff, to make the decision to also not take corporate PAC money. That's a good decision he's made and I commend him for it.

Laurenzo: Will you be helping him campaign or putting out an endorsement of any kind?

Rep. Porter: Well, I had a very pleasant exchange with Representative Schiff, and of course, I've seen him in Washington since. But I called and congratulated him. He sent me a lovely text message back. We've been colleagues, Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and I throughout this race. And so I'm excited to see the race continue. I'm very concerned about the policies that Steve Garvey expressed. Clearly, Adam Schiff is the right choice for California. Right now I've been focusing a lot on trying to help some of our other California candidates, raising money also for Joe Biden, but also for candidates like Dave Min, who's running in the seat that I'm currently in. Will Rollins, who's running against Ken Calvert, making sure that we're winning the House of Representatives back for Democrats.

Laurenzo: So there are a lot of questions surrounding your political future. You know the political consultant class likes to play the game of ""maybe this could happen"" and throw out those scenarios. One proposal was -- it even happened on our show a couple of weeks ago -- that you could potentially be a candidate for governor here in California. Are you interested in that?

Rep. Porter: Well, what I'm focusing on right now is continuing to do my job. I have lots of months left of serving Californians, and I've been working hard this week, having hearings about the oversight of foreign aid that we give to other countries, and a hearing about influence peddling in Congress. So I'm working to put together, hopefully, what will be a bipartisan piece of legislation that can help address those issues. I've also been doing a lot of planning for things that I'm gonna be able to do in my district to continue to represent my constituents. So that's where my focus is now, as well as on my three children.

Laurenzo: OK, so that's not a no. Let's say a Republican takes your Congressional seat and Dave Min is not successful... Would you rule out running for that seat again?

Rep. Porter: Well, I'm going to be out there knocking on doors all summer to make sure that Dave Min wins the seat. He had a strong win in the primary and look, Orange County has more registered Democrats than Republicans. This is a seat that we can hold.

Scott Bob's track record as a lobbyist lawbreaker is well known. California voters and Orange County voters had the chance to learn about that last cycle.

So my job is really to continue to help Democrats win up and down the ballot. That was going be what I was going to be doing if I had been successful in the Senate race, that's what I'm gonna be doing, even given that I wasn't successful.

Laurenzo: I want to ask you about TikTok, because this has been in the news. Legislation introduced made it out of the House and into the Senate right now where it seems to be stalled, and you are not for an outright ban of TikTok. Why is that?

Rep. Porter: Well, to be clear, the legislation that the House considered would have given TikTok a choice: either divest and sell from the Chinese owner ByteDance to an American-owned entity or cease to operate. So it wasn't a ban, it was a choice and if they didn't choose to sell to a U.S. subsidiary then they wouldn't have been able to operate.

Part of the reason I voted no on the legislation is that it was very, very hasty and we have not taken the time as representatives of the American people, to explain to our constituents what are the concerns about foreign ownership of media, including social media. Those are very, very real concerns.

I anticipate that there will be more legislation in this area going forward and I think we have to take both the national security concerns as well as the concerns about the influence of our democracy very, very seriously.

But we have to bring the American people along in that conversation and make sure that we're designing a bill that can actually work to achieve its intended outcome, which is to reduce the potential for foreign interference in our social media while preserving the ability for people to use a product in an app that they find useful.

Laurenzo: Congresswoman Katie Porter, as always, we appreciate your time here on Inside California Politics.",fox40.com,news,Fox40 KTXL,Jacque Porter,0.03529411764705892,448846092,1,https://fox40.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/03/GettyImages-1659530903.jpg?strip=1&w=640,eng-9408423

Penalties worth Rs 14 lakh have been imposed on the violators, an official said.

However, despite imposing penalties, construction waste has not been lifted from roadsides and vacant plots. MCG officials claimed they seized vehicles which were found to be dumping construction and septage waste. The civic body issued 45 challans in Jan, 55 in Feb and 38 in March.

The penalties for construction waste dumping ranged from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 and for septage waste dumping was Rs 25,000 each.

""We have been imposing penalties on people for illegally dumping construction and septage waste at public places, roadsides and other public places. We have constituted teams to keep a check on illegal dumping,"" said MCG commissioner Narhari Singh Banger.

Officials said that dumping of C&D waste is still going on unabated at Sector 29, Gurgaon-Faridabad road, Saraswati Kunj besides other parts in the city. The residents said that despite complaints, the waste is not lifted by the agency. MCG had initiated the tender process to hire a private agency for C&D waste collection, transportation and enforcement.

However, the process has been put on hold due to the implementation of model code of conduct.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",eptrail.com,news,Estes Park Trail-Gazette,,0.05882352941176472,448845486,1,https://www.eptrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

Businesses with a regular fiscal year (Jan. 1-Dec. 31) have until May 31, 2024, to prepare their accounts and declare their corporation tax on their 2023 profits.

""Our experience shows that one out of two companies does not take advantage of the tax base reduction and tax reliefs to which they are legally entitled, and this can create a serious financial, competitive disadvantage in today's economic environment,"" warns Csaba Szabó, accounting and tax director of ICT Európa Finance Zrt.

Corporate tax relief is based on three pillars: tax deferral, tax base reduction, and tax incentives.

The best-known example of tax deferral is allocating a development reserve. This method involves setting aside funds for anticipated development projects or investments. Typically, these funds must be used within a designated timeframe, with exceptions in certain circumstances. Failure to utilize the development reserve within the specified period may result in the repayment of previously deferred corporation tax, along with penalties. Some companies facing liquidity issues opt to delay the payment of corporation tax by utilizing this method.

Hungary's range of tax base reduction options and tax incentives is extensive. They are mostly linked to small- to large-scale investments but also include R&D tax deductions, the possibility of sponsoring team sports, and regional and other incentives for SMEs. The significant difference is that while tax deferral options defer tax, and tax is paid over time, tax relief and specific tax base reduction options save actual tax revenue.

In recent years, in addition to the SME investment loan interest rate relief, development tax relief has also become available in the SME sector, offering significant savings if a business has major investment plans.

What is a development tax credit? It's a tax relief available for businesses to claim against their corporate tax, with a maximum benefit of 80% of the corporate tax amount in a given year. This tax credit can be claimed for up to 13 tax years following the year in which the investment is put into service or, alternatively, in the tax year when the investment is put into service, along with the subsequent 12 tax years. The maximum claim period extends up to 16 tax years after the submission of the declaration or application. Additionally, there are stipulations regarding the minimum investment amount and limits on tax relief and aid intensity as a percentage of the investment's value.

Tax relief for energy improvements has also become available in recent years, providing potential savings for businesses. It's important to note that incentives such as the company car tax credit also apply to company vehicles.

Szabó highlights that ICT Európa Finance's tax due diligence on more than 100 companies in recent years has revealed a significant trend: nearly every second company examined has overlooked substantial tax benefits, amounting to millions of forints.

On average, our audits have uncovered HUF 2.6 mln of overpaid taxes that could have been avoided if these deductions had been utilized. In today's challenging economic climate, neglecting available tax deductions can result in a considerable liquidity disadvantage for businesses. Therefore, seeking guidance from an experienced tax advisor before finalizing the corporate tax return is strongly advised.",bbj.hu,news,Budapest Business Journal,,0.1215686274509804,448845328,1,https://bbj.hu/uploads/banners/20243/ICT Europa-5479-014 (3)-SMALLER-CUT.jpg,eng-9411982

Chicago voters rejected an increase to the city's transfer tax on high-value properties in a Tuesday referendum, The Associated Press said, leaving unfulfilled a longtime goal of Mayor Brandon Johnson and progressive Democrats who wanted to use new revenue to address homelessness in the country's third-largest city.

The result came after days of counting ballots, including mail-in votes, that were not able to be reported on Election Day.

Real estate groups had warned that the new rates would have been a potentially catastrophic blow to the downtown office market, which was already losing value and struggling with vacancies.

The vote came at an uncertain political moment in Chicago, a Democrat-dominated city where homelessness has become more visible since the pandemic and an influx of migrants has strained resources. And the result raised questions about the strength of the city's progressive movement, led by Mr. Johnson, which has become the dominant force in City Hall over the last decade and which mobilized its army of volunteers to knock on doors in support of the tax change.

""yes, it is a loss for Mayor Johnson and is a loss for the progressive movement,"" said Dick W. Simpson, a former Chicago City Council member and an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who campaigned for the tax change.

The referendum called for raising transfer taxes on properties that sell for more than $1 million while lowering that rate on properties that sell for less. Supporters described it as a chance to level the playing field and help the city's most vulnerable residents.

The eVAT system started at the beginning of the year, the detailed domestic rules of the global minimum tax came into force, the introduction of the compulsory recollection system further complicates the regulation of domestic waste management, and importers already have to provide data under CBam (carbon border adjustment mechanism). It is also important that, as of Jan. 1, Hungary does not have a valid double taxation treaty with the United States.

Péter Hajnal: Several small changes affect the state budget, but I would mention introducing the global minimum tax and the tax amnesty after reported shares.

András Szalai: I would mention two major changes: 1) In line with the EU GloBE Directive 2022/2523, Hungary implemented the Global Minimum Tax regime. The interpretation and application of the new law will be challenging both for the companies involved and for professionals. 2) As a next step towards digitalization, eVAT was implemented from the start of this year as an optional solution besides traditional manual tax returns.

Helga Kiss: One of the most significant changes affects fiduciary trusts' personal income tax liability. Instead of the so-called input taxation in force until 2023, the tax changes introduce output taxation. In practice, from 2024, the taxation point shifts from the revaluation of assets to the current market value when the private individual beneficiary receives revenue. For the PIT liability calculation, the dividend rules are applied if the asset transfer is carried out within five years and the asset value has increased due to the revaluation. The trustor must keep records about the increase in the asset value.

Companies will have the opportunity for a tax amnesty in 2024 by retrospectively declaring participation in acquisitions previously not reported to the Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration (NAV). This will allow corporate income taxpayers who have previously failed to declare their participation in other companies to be exempt from paying Corporate Income Tax. The deadline for the retrospective declaration is the submission period for the 2023 CIT return. The biggest beneficiaries of this could be those companies expecting significant market value growth in their subsidiary. There are several conditions to consider; for example, the market value of the participation has to be supported by an independent expert company.

Gyöngyi Ferencz: The global minimum tax will open a new chapter in the taxation of multinational corporations, especially in Hungary, where the new rules could make a particularly huge difference due to the currently low corporate tax rate. Further important changes are the eVAT system that will modernize and digitalize the VAT return process, the introduction of the e-receipt and e-cash register system, and the termination of the U.S.-Hungary Double Tax Treaty. It is also worth preparing to face increased transfer pricing external audits in 2024.

Zoltán Lambert: The introduction of the global minimum tax is a milestone for those subject to it, and they should have started to think about the effects in Hungary by modeling and calculating future tax liabilities. The start of the eVAT return is also a significant change, but it will not make accountants redundant now.

BBJ: What are the biggest accountancy changes for 2024?

Judit Jancsa-Pék: One of the most challenging tasks for companies to adjust is the new GLoBE system. To ensure a better position for GloBE-affected companies, deferred taxation has been introduced into the Hungarian accounting standards as an option. The issue affects 2023 as well, from tax and accounting points of view, as this year's decisions will affect the taxation of the period starting from 2024.

P H: We do not see substantial regulation changes for 2024. NAV is better involved in the procedures and tries to support accountancy, improve transparency and set up checkpoints.

A Sz: By far, the biggest change of recent years is implementing the deferred tax concept. The aim is to mitigate the disadvantageous effect of Hungarian tax relief on GloBE calculation; the application is optional.

Gy F: One of the most significant accountancy changes for 2024 is the recognition of deferred tax in the annual accounts, regardless of whether a company prepares IFRS reports or not. This option will likely be used primarily by Hungarian subsidiaries of foreign companies with reporting obligations under other accounting standards (IFRS, GAAP, etc.) It will often allow easier convergence between the Hungarian and international accounting reporting systems.

The other significant new element affecting several larger companies is the introduction of ESG reporting obligations in the financial statements from the 2024 fiscal year. Businesses falling within the scope of the CSRD Directive are required to prepare a sustainability report. Preparation in good time will be advisable, as the reporting tasks are pretty time-consuming, and the report will be subject to an auditor review.

Z L: The new deferred tax accounting rules, which may affect the global minimum tax, need to be reviewed in more detail. Decision-makers should also consider that these rules can be applied for 2023 as well.

BBJ: What tax changes would you most like to see introduced, and is there any likelihood of that happening?

KR: Companies and investors identify several risks associated with the Hungarian tax system. These include sector-specific taxation, special taxes and retroactive legislative practices. Another complicating factor is that one tax is regulated by several bodies of legislation simultaneously, often at different levels of the hierarchy. Changing how legislators think in this area would be a significant step forward in simplifying the tax system.

J J-P: It would be nice if not only major team sports could be supported by corporate income tax but also foundations supporting health institutions and environmental protection. This decision not only depends on the Hungarian decision-makers but would also require EU negotiations, meaning that even if there was an intention to do so, and the budget situation allowed it, it would take longer to get through.

P H: Canceling or reducing special taxes would be a popular decision.

A Sz: There have been improvements in digitalization and paperless administration; however, certain areas seem to be behind this trend. Social security administration has examples where a paper-based format is still used.

Gy F: An essential step in taxation would be acting against over-regulation and unnecessary administration. VGD Hungary will share its professional suggestions through chamber committees.

Z L: We continuously emphasize that wage and investment costs should be considered when calculating the local business tax. However, we do not see that this will change in the near future or at all.

BBJ: What accountancy changes would you most like to see introduced, and is there any likelihood of that happening?

P H: Administrative and bureaucratic burdens should be further decreased. There are promising initiatives to move forward, but the actions come slowly.

A Sz: We would like a more up-to-date accounting law that follows business and technology trends. For example, the need to handle cryptocurrency transactions arises more often, but our law still offers no guidance.

Anita Perge: We advocate for tax and accountancy reforms that promote competitiveness, simplify compliance, and stimulate investment. Regarding accountancy reforms, a closer alignment with IFRS is desirable. This would facilitate global business operations and financial reporting.

BBJ: What is coming down the line in the next few years that businesses should prepare for now?

KR: The eVAT system allows companies to submit their VAT return faster, more securely and accurately. This development is especially important because, in the coming years, all company tax returns, such as corporate or local business tax, may or must be submitted electronically. The system is based on the SAF-T standard developed by the OECD, which describes the data provision in XML data format, designed to specify and transfer digitalized accounting data related to taxation.

J J-P: Many things are changing in international taxation. For example, VIDA is coming into VAT as a European-based digital solution that will raise Digital Regulatory Reporting, a transaction-based approach. It will enable all multinationals in EU member states to implement regulatory reporting rules consistently. DRR could impose new challenges for multinational enterprises and hand new weapons to tax authorities. In summary, EU-level data provision will be developed, which will partly help reduce the companies' administrative burdens and, on the other hand, whiten the economy.

The other clear highlights of international taxation are provided by another EU Commission package that consists of three legislative proposals: the framework for income taxation (""Befit"") directive, a proposal establishing a head office tax system for SMEs (""HOT""), and a transfer pricing directive (TPD). While they bring different challenges, and their adoption is still unclear (both timing-wise and in final format), these proposals will be on the agenda of 2024 and should be monitored closely.

P H: The rise of AI is increasingly likely in accounting; however, using the new technologies assumes sweeping changes in the procedures and company managers' mentality. There are many automations to increase efficiency and avoid manual work, but AI could also bring new dimensions to our profession.

A Sz: In line with the ViDA reform of the EU, the mandatory e-invoicing of intra-community B2B transactions is coming in the next few years. Although it may not seem difficult to issue e-invoices, it may be challenging to comply with the legal requirements for storage.

H K: The eVAT system introduced this year will revolutionize VAT reporting with a data-centric approach. It aims to enhance VAT submission accuracy and efficiency by leveraging real-time invoice reports, cash registers, and customs declarations, reducing administrative burdens for businesses and NAV. The potential to reduce tax audits is significant.

Allowing businesses to correct errors preemptively lowers the likelihood of audits due to inaccuracies. Adopting eVAT promises streamlined reporting, fewer audits, and standardized VAT analytics submission, enhancing consistency and reducing NAV's administrative load. Businesses should focus on the quality of their real-time invoice data submissions, partner master data, tax codes, and reporting processes. As NAV's inspection and data analysis methods evolve, the importance of data quality will increase.

A P: Businesses should prepare for changes and trends such as regulatory shifts, technological innovations, AI, and evolving consumer behaviors. NAV's ongoing initiatives, such as expanding online invoice systems to include eVAT and e-receipts, are pivotal. These steps towards digital transformation underscore the need for businesses to adapt swiftly to technological advancements. Also, the expanding influence of AI across our industry and client workflows promises to be transformative, necessitating a proactive and prepared approach that prioritizes data protection.

Z L: We believe major changes will occur from compliance and advisory perspectives. From a compliance point of view, the reporting process will be more complex, based on the EU rules (TP reports, GMT reporting, DAC7 reporting, etc.). Data reporting may also substitute the traditional tax reporting methods in which taxpayers submit tax returns. To do so, the ability to handle mass data will be crucial. This will happen with AI but controlled by human experts. On the other hand, tax advisors will have a vital role in interpreting and translating the fast-evolving global tax changes to in-house tax experts.

BBJ: Are you concerned about finding enough graduates of the right caliber for your business?

P H: This has been a continuous concern for years, not only in our business sector.

There are an increasing number of investments and international companies in Hungary, but on the other hand, the number of graduates is decreasing. Due to this competition, your company must be very attractive (professionally, environmentally, and humanly) to those you want to hire or retain.

A Sz: No, we are hiring fresh graduates and experienced colleagues. Despite the recent economic slowdown, the competition in the labor market remains intense, so we need to keep focus on improving our career proposition to maintain success in employee recruitment and retention.

A P: Concerns persist within the industry about finding graduates with the right caliber of skills and expertise. This situation underscores the need for a strategic approach in hiring, focusing on identifying those with the right attitude and skill set and who align with our organizational culture and values. The other pillar of this strategy ensures our employees' ongoing development and education. Our robust talent development program fosters a supportive environment across the company. This is one way to mitigate any talent challenges.

""There's so much misinformation out there that it really, sometimes, makes the job very challenging,"" Burnette said.

One thing many people think about during tax season is the possibility of a refund.

Burnette recommends that you don't spend your money on during a shopping spree.

""Have a plan for a refund. I almost don't care what the plan is, as long as you have one short of, we're just going to go blow it,"" Burnette said.

For many, it's a chance to catch up on a few things.

""Maybe if he's got credit cards, pay down some credit cards with part of it, maybe increase your retirement savings with part of it,"" Burnette said.

But, he said as long as you have a plan, it's okay to have some fun.

""I don't have a problem with keeping part of it for having fun. Okay, you earned it,"" Burnette said.

If you have a large refund, Burnette said you should do some homework and understand what a tax refund is.

""What you have essentially done is given the federal government an interest-free loan for a year, and then you have to file and beg for it back. I don't like that,"" Burnette said.

If you are constantly using your refund to catch up on areas you're behind, Burnette said you should take a look at your deductions.

Provisions that continue to be included in the contract are complimentary solid waste containers at village facilities and at community events.

""Waste Management has indicated to us that, across the board, waste hauling would go up 3% this year, for the first year of the contract. For the remaining four years of the contract, it would fall back,"" said Sfondilis. ""This is a big deal and a win for the community as waste hauling expenses have skyrocketed over the last few years. Our clause in our franchise that keeps that cap at 3% is really protection against the economic environments both short term and long term.""

Five years ago, Wheeling joined Waste Management's AYD Special Collection program, which specializes in the removal of household waste directly from the front door. Sfondilis has said that, based on the metrics, the program's success has not been reaching its peak. Fees for this have been paid for in local taxes.

""On average, there are 460 pickups annually, which makes this not beneficial to the village of Wheeling. So, that service has been removed from this extension. However, I should mention that the idea of collecting household hazardous remains a priority for staff and I believe for the community,"" Sfondilis said.

Wheeling is a member of the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC). Sfondilis said that they are discussing a consortium contract with Clean Harbors based in Chicago. Clean Harbors will provide the same AYD collection service curbside for a rate that is less than what Waste Management was charging.

""I will be working with SWANCC over the next six months to bring that program to the organization as a whole. Should the timing not work out, I will bring back a one-year contract with Clean Harbors to you all to consider whether the village of Wheeling should, on its own, join their program for household hazardous waste,"" said Sfondilis.

Hazardous household waste includes old or used motor oil, cleaning products, fluorescent lamp bulbs, batteries, and several other chemical-based products that have been used or expired.",journal-topics.com,news,Journal Online,,-0.06666666666666665,448844999,1,https://www.journal-topics.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2017-08-12/f309c6a5bf3a445fe12c6605e9b34c79.jpg,

The scheme, which was run out of a prison in California, federal officials said, attempted to fraudulently claim more than half a billion dollars in tax refunds.

The method was a familiar one: erroneous claims of the Employee Retention Tax Credit.

The IRS said on Friday that it was intensifying its efforts to root out such cases of fraud and attempted fraud as it tried to safeguard taxpayer money, but it acknowledged that without an intervention by Congress, the agency would continue to be flooded with potentially improper claims.

One of the most brazen cases connected to the program emerged in February, when federal agents announced charges against a man they called the ringleader of a fraud operation, Kristopher Thomas, a former gang member who was already serving prison time for murder. He was charged along with seven co-conspirators outside prison, including his mother, who were helping to carry out the plan, authorities said.

The joint investigation by the FBI and the criminal investigation unit of the IRS was called ""Operation Fraud Street Mafia."" It involved intercepted calls and text messages exchanging information about fake businesses while using the money they made to live luxuriously -- even flying on a private jet to a party in Las Vegas.

The alleged plot is perhaps the most egregious example of the abuse of a tax benefit that was created during the throes of the pandemic to keep businesses and their workers afloat. Since the program's inception in 2020, a new industry of tax preparation firms has popped up just to process claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which allows businesses to collect up to $26,000 for each employee on its payroll.

But the program has been rife with fraud, with many of the wrongdoers being tax prep firms luring businesses to apply for tax credits that they are not qualified to receive. As a result, the program has cost the federal government billions more than originally estimated.

Taxpayers can continue to apply for the tax credit through 2025, but the IRS paused the program last September so that it could sift through a backlog of claims and step up audits. Lawmakers in Congress have been negotiating over tax legislation that would shut the program down early, potentially saving the federal government approximately $80 billion, but an agreement has yet to be reached.

The IRS said on Friday that since it temporarily stopped accepting new applications for the credits last fall and offered taxpayers the chance to withdraw their claims, it has protected more than $1 billion in federal tax revenue. However, the agency warned the program remains a problem and that it still had about 1 million unprocessed claims.

""We remain deeply concerned about widespread abuse involving these claims that have harmed small businesses,"" Daniel Werfel, the IRS commissioner, said in a statement.

Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers on Friday to end the tax credit program.

""Congress must act to protect the interests of U.S. taxpayers and honest small businesses and give the IRS the tools it needs to tackle fraud,"" he said.

Since last September, 1,800 businesses withdrew claims totaling $251 million. The IRS said that during the last six months it has also caught 12,000 businesses filing more than 22,000 claims that were improper, resulting in $572 million in penalties.

The pot of a seemingly limitless amount of pandemic relief money led tax preparation firms to embark on a blitz of advertising to persuade businesses to apply for the credits, yielding them lucrative commissions.

In the case of Thomas, the court documents showed that he and his associates filed approximately 300 payroll tax returns that claimed over $550 million in refunds that were largely associated with the Employee Retention Tax Credit.

Officials said that the returns were for ""fake business entities, actual businesses with overstated wages and numbers of employees, and businesses that were defunct at the time the payroll tax returns were filed."" Much of the money that they sought was not refunded because the IRS suspected fraud.

The case demonstrated a striking level of recklessness. At one point in 2023, Thomas was heard speaking on a recorded jail line with his mother about her concerns that the federal government would catch on to what they were doing, officials have said.

Thomas, according to the complaint, downplayed those concerns, saying they would likely be told ""you owe us this back and you have to pay it back whenever y'all can,"" which would be the ""33rd of Neveruary.""",spokesman.com,news,The Spokesman Review,,-0.3725490196078431,448844819,1,,

It will give lump sum payments of $5,000 to new and returning frontline crews this year.

The promise of a big one-time cheque to wildfire crews hopes to bring in new fire rangers and keep existing ones from leaving.

MNRF Minister Graydon Smith said it's a solid incentive.

""I don't think there's anybody that would shy away from having an extra $5,000 in their pocket,"" Smith said.

But critics said it's hardly enough to entice people to risk their lives tackling increasingly severe fire seasons. Pushing for wage increases and workplace safety coverage, OPSEU scoffed at the program in a statement:

""Instead of ... recognizing wildland fire workers for the work they do and compensating them properly or ensuring they have the coverage they need for the risks they face, this government is choosing PR stunts. They're more concerned about suppressing criticism than protecting our air quality and human life.""

Backing OPSEU, Northern New Democrat MPP Guy Bourgouin said if last year's record fire season is any indication, the province will need a full complement of fire rangers.

He said a one-time pay bump won't get the job done.

""It's already a competitive world out there when it comes to labour, and leaving the wages at $18 and just giving lump sums ... doesn't address it,"" Bourgouin said.

""We need to fix this thing once and for all, long term, that we have the crews necessary (to) fight these fires. Because it will only get worse.""

Smith replied that the incentive is only for 2024 and that wage negotiations will happen later. He noted that the province moved around 100 temporary workers into full-time positions and said recruiting more fire rangers is a priority.

""We want to have a robust crew complement, here, in Ontario,"" he said.

""Not only to help our communities, but also to help others.""

Bourgouin said there will be a meeting with the labour minister on Monday to discuss fire ranger protections.

You can sign-up to get Tax Breaks in your inbox here.

With about a month to go before Tax Day (don't shoot the messenger), the most recent tax data suggests that taxpayers still aren't rushing to file.

The IRS has received 54,030,000 individual income tax returns as of March 1, 2024, a 1.7% decline from the previous year. And while the IRS points to the current tax season beginning about a week later than it did in 2023, the due date is earlier in 2024 -- April 15 in 2024 compared to April 18 in 2023. A more compressed season (78 days in 2024, compared to 86 days in 2023) should mean taxpayers would be motivated to file early, since there are far fewer days to procrastinate. That is clearly not the case in 2024. (☆)

More likely? Taxpayers are waiting to file until the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act becomes law. The legislation, which would, among other things, expand the child tax credit retroactively to the 2023 tax year, was announced in mid-January and passed the House at the end of the month. However, the bill has stalled in the Senate -- as of now, no vote has been scheduled. Yes, still. (☆)

President Joe Biden took the opportunity during his State of the Union address to call on Congress to restore the expanded child tax credit. But Mark W. Everson, vice chairman of alliantgroup, and IRS commissioner from 2003-2007, noted a glaring omission: no mention of the research and development (R&D) credit. Restoring the R&D credit has broad bipartisan support -- and is particularly popular with corporations who might not be excited about other parts of Biden's plan. The corporate-friendly provision made some of the more family-friendly parts of the bill more appealing for some members of Congress. Not mentioning it in the speech was, Everson says, ""A missed opportunity."" (☆)

Biden also took the opportunity to tout parts of his economic plan. The President claimed that 1,000 American billionaires pay an average tax rate of 8.2%. He wants to boost that to a minimum tax rate of 25% while reiterating a promise that under his Administration, ""nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in federal taxes -- nobody -- not one penny."" That's consistent with the messaging we've been hearing from the U.S. Treasury and the IRS.

The White House also wants to eliminate tax loopholes, such as those associated with carried interest, estate and gift taxes, and life insurance. There are no clear winners or losers yet, but the ongoing debate highlights the complex and multi-faceted nature of tax policy discussions in the U.S.

Maybe the most controversial aspect of Biden's plan is to boost the corporate tax rate to at least 21% and end tax breaks for ""Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay."" He reminded the country that he had previously represented corporate-friendly Delaware for 36 years, adding, ""I'm not anti-corporation.""

If you have interest, you can read the entire Green Book. The Green Book outlines the revenue proposals included in the President's budget, including tax proposals. Settle in -- at 248 pages, it's not a quick read.

Speaking of corporations, the Department of Justice and Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have formally notified the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama that they will appeal the ruling in favor of the National Small Business Association (NSBA), striking down the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke of the Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division, found the CTA unconstitutional ""because it exceeds the Constitution's limits on Congress' power."" (☆)

On March 11, 2024, the government formally filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which has jurisdiction over federal cases in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. In civil cases like this one, an appeal doesn't typically put a stop to the original judgment -- that means that the enjoinder barring Treasury from enforcing the CTA against the NSBA remains in place while the matter is pending. After the filing, Treasury confirmed it was their position that only members of the NSBA as of March 1, 2024, are included in the ruling. (☆)

Companies are also making news for hiring -- the unemployment rate has been below 4% for two years running, the best record since the 1960s. Wages are also edging up -- but is it sustainable? Employers are thinking about strategies for attracting and retaining workers without dipping into their cash, and they're reaching back into their late 1990s/(very) early 2000s bag of compensation tricks. In some sectors, equity compensation awards are all the rage again -- and no wonder, since it's a chance to offer employees a stake in the company without writing a check. Equity compensation is typically tied to periods of time or employee performance -- the company's goal is to keep you employed and vested in the health and growth of the company. While these plans can be lucrative, they can also be tricky. From stock options to RSUs to phantom stock, here's a quick look at some of the most common types of equity compensation. (☆)

Also tricky? Cryptocurrency. A question about cryptocurrency can be found on Forms 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1041, 1065, 1120, 1120, and 1120S. Taxpayers must check a box answering either ""Yes"" or ""No"" to a question about crypto ownership. Does the question really matter? A simple yes or no can turn out to be important -- the question feels similar to the offshore assets question (now found on Schedule B) that ensnared a number of taxpayers who were not reporting those assets.

Understanding the tax consequences of crypto and digital currency transactions is crucial. Beyond the immediate issues, like recognition of income and capital gains, it's also important to recognize that tax obligations can vary significantly depending on where you live (fortunately, some countries have agreements in place to prevent double taxation on the same income).

A record 1.2 million U.S. vehicle buyers opted to go fully electric last year, according to estimates from Kelley Blue Book. That represents 7.6% of the total U.S. vehicle market, up from 5.9% in 2022.

Congress hopes tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) further boost those numbers. It may be working: A new studysuggests that owning an electric vehicle is cheaper than owning a comparably sized and equipped gas-powered one. (☆) The rules are far from settled -- they changed again in 2024 to allow for money in hand at the dealer -- causing confusion.

So, it's not surprising that this week's question focuses on EVs. Specifically, a reader asks:

Buying my son an EV for graduation (he will make small payments on a loan I will have to co-sign for). Can he get the Federal incentive (his income will be about $30k for partial year 2024 salary) if I co-sign the loan and gift a down payment.First of all, what a great dad!

Second, the rules for the EV credit revolve around ownership and use -- the source of the funds is not part of the qualification (although income level may be, see below).

It's worth noting that the credit is nonrefundable, so you can't get back more credit than you owe in taxes, and you can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.

Keep in mind that your lender's financing requirements may be different from the tax rules, just as with a mortgage.

And from one college parent to another, happy graduation to you both!

ZIP Code data tables for the 2021 tax year are now available on the IRS website. The data offers selected income and tax return items for approximately 43,000 ZIP Codes across the U.S.

Here's a look at how that translates to total tax liability by county. For a more in-depth look, click on the individual counties on the map below (it's addictive -- you've been warned).

Of course, tax liability doesn't paint a complete picture. Wallet Hub put together a comparison based on three metrics: the return on taxes paid to the federal government, the share of federal jobs, and federal funding as a share of state revenue.

The most federally dependent states, using that metric, are:

We still don't have guidance for implementing the energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, but some practitioners are already looking ahead to next year when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions will expire. That confluence of events will likely raise a host of questions. Should Congress let the TCJA expire? Extend? Cancel the IRA energy tax credit? Or do something new altogether, like tacking on a carbon tax? Policy-making -- especially on the tax front -- has focused on the tax code more and more. Much of that was evidenced by the IRA, which ""turbocharged"" tax benefits, turning the IRS into the agency primarily responsible for implementing climate policy. That's likely to continue into next year -- and it's worth watching for taxpayers and tax professionals alike.

The state of New York is also focusing on energy policy through the tax code. New York State Senate Bill S3596B, if passed, would expand the existing state solar energy system equipment credit from 25% of qualified system installation costs with a cap of $5,000, to a cap of $10,000. The bill is expensive (credits usually are), but supporters argue that the benefit outweighs the cost. And, there's a social policy twist: the credit would be refundable for low to moderate-income taxpayers or those residing in a disadvantaged community -- taxpayers traditionally priced out of alternative energy solutions. The bill is currently winding its way through committee and must still pass the House and Senate. There's no doubt that other states will be watching.

In the movie Brokedown Palace (another flashback to the 1990s), two friends -- played by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale -- find themselves surrounded by police at the airport after heroin was found in their luggage. The film -- said to be based on a true story -- offered a glimpse of the danger of operating as a ""drug mule."" The term typically refers to someone who personally transports illegal drugs on behalf of another person, even if they do so without knowing they're committing a crime. The same principle is used in other crimes -- people who move illicit funds between bank accounts, currencies, and blockchains to avoid detection on behalf of a criminal enterprise are also mules. According to IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), these individuals are called money mules. (☆)

This month, IRS-CI partnered with other federal agencies in an effort deemed The Money Mule Initiative. Now in its sixth year, the initiative aims to identify and prosecute facilitators of money mule schemes.

The IRS has announced that Guy Ficco will become the new IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) chief as of April 1, 2024. Ficco will succeed Chief Jim Lee, who announced his retirement from federal service in February. Before the move, Ficco served as Deputy Chief. He was named to that post in 2022, taking over from Jim Robnett, who retired after 36 years of IRS service. Before being appointed Deputy Chief, Ficco was the executive director of Global Operations Policy and Support at CI. Ficco first joined the IRS in July 1995. (☆)

The survey found that 29% are currently using gen AI, while an additional 26% are taking action to explore its capabilities. A significant percentage of respondents (30%) also expressed their intention to increase technology investments over the next 12 months. The survey was based on insights from 300 CTOs at large public and private U.S. companies.

In 2006, Professor Erik Lie testified before Congress about his research into stock options. What percentage of firms that granted options to top executives between the years 1996 and 2005 manipulated one or more option grants in some fashion?

I hope you'll get to know some of our staff and contributors. Since it feels like everything old is new again, I asked: Which pop culture trend would you want to see return?

Kelly Phillips Erb (Senior Writer, Tax): I'm a fan of Cyndi Lauper-esque skirts and bracelets -- I wouldn't mind seeing them come back into fashion.

Andrew Leahey (Contributor, Tax): Pogs! In the mid- to late-1990s kids in my area (the Jersey Shore) were all about them. Regular pogs, slammers (which were hefty little metal versions), and bombers ... I think they were called ... which were these little hunks of metal. I think there was a game to be played with pogs, but no one I know bothered to do anything more than collect the little things.

Amber Gray-Fenner (Contributor, Tax): The knitting craze (well, for us knitters it amounted to a craze) in the early aughts.

Brandon Kochkodin (Writer, Money Team): Rock music. I can't remember the last time I heard guitars on the radio and not just autotuned music.

That's the number of eligible taxpayers in the 12 states which are a part of the IRS Direct File program who can now use the system. The IRS announced the full-scale launch of the pilot on March 12, 2024.

The answer is (D) 29%.

Professor Lie's research indicated that a whopping 29% of firms that granted options to top executives between 1996 and 2005 manipulated one or more option grants in some fashion. Often, the grant dates were retroactively changed so the executives could benefit from a lower exercise price.

The Canada Revenue Agency says Festus Bayden, of Brampton, Ont., was a partner in a tax preparation business known as E & F Tax Associates or as Bankay Financial Services Inc. in Toronto and later in Brampton.

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

""These promoters deliberately make false statements to assist their clients in avoiding or evading tax,"" the Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement.

""As a result, they obtain a financial benefit from the fees they receive from their clients. To maintain the fairness of our tax system, the CRA holds both those promoters who facilitate tax evasion, as well as those who use their services to evade taxes, accountable for their actions.""

The company is currently in the process of selling a stake previously owned by the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

Anthropic is at a pivotal juncture, seeking to sell an 8% stake that FTX once acquired for $500 million. This stake, worth more than $1 billion today, is one of the components of Anthropic's approach to assets management during FTX's bankruptcy settlements.

The sale is designed to recover the losses of FTX users who suffered losses when the exchange ceased to operate. The valuation of Anthropic at $18.4 billion underlines the geopolitical and security dilemmas tech companies deal with, especially with regard to artificial intelligence, and the company's choice to exclude Saudi Arabian investors from the transaction.

The transaction is expected to be close within the next few weeks and has involved complex negotiations and planning. The investment bank of Perella Weinberg has been selected to conduct the sale so that the disposal of the share to the new investors is well structured and strategic. Despite the fact that this change has only influenced Anthropic's financial environment, it is also reflective of the general tendencies in the AI industry regarding growth and investment trends.

Security-related issues are the underlying cause of Anthropic's refusal of Saudi Arabian investors. The company is a direct rival of OpenAI's ChatGPT and operates in a sphere of technology that has a great influence on both civilian and military markets.

This sensitivity necessitates a careful approach to investor relations, especially with a country like Saudi Arabia, which has been very proactive in diversifying its economy through investments in technology and AI.

However, this exclusion is not broad as all sovereign wealth funds are still out, leaving UAE-based Mubadala Investment Company as a potential investor. This strategic approach is indicative of Anthropic's approach towards partnerships and investments, which makes it possible to balance financial and ethical considerations of national security.

The emergence of AI technologies will most likely strengthen the impact of the sources of funding and their consequences for both security and corporate governance.

The AI sector is drawing a lot of interest from investors from all over the world, including sovereign wealth funds, who want to reap the growth potential that it offers. Investment trends in AI, where geopolitical, security, and ethical concerns are growing, are mirrored by the stake sale of Anthropic and the low-key choice of investors.

Apart from other sovereign wealth fund interests, Mubadala also illustrates the cross-border character of AI investments, going beyond the traditional tech hubs and penetrating emerging economies and markets seeking diversification.

The exclusion, in addition, of Saudi Arabia from Anthropic's investment pool, despite its ambitious Vision 2030 initiative and impressive investment in technology and AI, is indicative of the many forces at play. These are not only financial decisions but also are influenced by geopolitical, international relations, and strategic directions of the developing technologies.

But after three years, a VA doctor determined Elliott no longer qualified for the assistive mobility device and told her to use a wheelchair again.

""Forcing veterans to stay in wheelchairs when assistive mobility devices are available is not acceptable,"" Elliott, 34, told lawmakers Thursday in support of the STAND Act during a hearing of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee's subpanel on health.

The STAND Act, or the Spinal Trauma Access to New Devices Act, is legislation sponsored by Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general.

""We are systematically failing our veterans by not providing them with rapid access to this technology,"" he said at the hearing.

The exoskeleton is available through a prescription at the VA, though Bergman and other lawmakers said veterans often are not informed about the devices by their doctors or evaluated for their eligibility to receive them.

Some lawmakers said reporting requirements and other paperwork that doctors must complete to offer and train patients on the device has discouraged some facilities from offering it.

The STAND Act would mandate annual physicals for paralyzed veterans that would include assessments to receive the exoskeleton, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

""In my view, this bill is critical to codify what the VA already should be doing at annual medical assessments for veterans. I can tell you firsthand that they are not,"" Elliott said.

VA regulations now allow for ""powered exoskeletons"" as a prescribed medical device that is ""placed over a person's paralyzed or weakened limbs for the purpose of providing ambulation,"" according to the department's clinical protocol issued in 2018.

But Bergman said the legislation is needed to ensure that qualifying veterans can access the devices through their VA providers. A companion bill was introduced Thursday by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.

Elliott was paralyzed in 2015 when a vehicle operated by a drunken driver ran a red light and hit the car that Elliott was driving near her Tennessee home.

She was a medically discharged veteran at the time, recovering from a broken right femur that she had suffered in basic training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island, S.C., and preparing to re-enlist.

Roscoe Butler, associate legislative director for the nonprofit veterans group Paralyzed Veterans of America, testified in support of the bill.

He described exoskeletons as ""life-changing options for improving functionality and independence.""

The computerized devices are wearable suits equipped with motorized joints, sensors and rechargeable batteries. They range in price from roughly $75,000 to $100,000 with veterans enrolled in VA health care receiving coverage for most of the cost.

Worn over clothes, the exoskeleton suit wraps around an individual's legs, chest and back.

In Elliott's case, she initially enrolled in a clinical trial in 2015 to try an exoskeleton. She traveled from her Tennessee home to participate in an eight-week trial at a VA facility in St. Louis, where she was fitted with the device and learned how to use it.

""I took the device home and used it everywhere,"" she said.

But when she returned to the St. Louis facility in 2018 for a reassessment, her doctor informed her that she could no longer use the device, Elliott said.

""I was returned to my wheelchair and told to get used to it,"" she told lawmakers.

Elliott testified that for the next four years, she - with the help of her father - worked to overturn the decision to take the exoskeleton device away from her.

""I engaged in local and regional battles to get the device back that transformed my life,"" she said.

Elliott now advocates and speaks on the behalf of other paralyzed veterans. She said it often is a challenge for veterans who are paralyzed to receive physical exams in a timely manner at local and regional facilities.

In 2022, Elliott and her father traveled to a VA health clinic in Mississippi, where a VA physician agreed to evaluate and equip her with a new exoskeleton.

""It is appalling to me that Brittany Elliott was told to just get used to returning to her wheelchair,"" said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, a doctor and chairwoman of the House VA subcommittee on health.

Miller-Meeks said she has patients with paralysis and sees the potential and benefits with assistive mobility devices.

""Exoskeletons need to have much more serious consideration and use at the VA to help our veterans become ambulatory,"" she said.

Butler said the STAND Act would require the VA to provide annual medical exams for paralyzed veterans. As it is now, access is inconsistent across the nation's VA clinics and hospitals.

He said the annual check-ups are critical for identifying health problems -- such as urinary tract infections and pressure sores -- before they worsen and cause more serious problems.

""Some VA facilities do an excellent job but not all of them. There is room for improvement,"" Butler said.",stripes.com,news,Stars and Stripes,Linda F.

In an effort to ease the housing market's tight inventory and support homeowners looking to upgrade, Biden announced a proposal on Thursday aimed at incentivizing the sale of starter homes.

""For homeowners looking for a new place but worried about giving up their lower mortgage rate, I'm proposing a $10,000 tax credit if they sell their starter homes,"" Biden tweeted. The initiative seeks to make more homes available to first-time buyers and allow current homeowners to transition to residences that ""better suit their needs"" with the $10,000 tax credit serving to ease the financial strain.

But doing so would see the homeowner who had the low mortgage rate actually pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more in interest than they would have if they just remained in that home. ""I understand the intention behind Biden's proposal, but frankly, the math doesn't add up for me,"" Kipp told Newsweek via phone call on Friday afternoon.

For example, consider a homeowner who took advantage of the average mortgage rate of 2.96 percent in 2021, securing a 10 percent down payment on a $450,000 home with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Over the life of the loan, they would pay a total of $611,557.81, including interest of $206,557.81.

In contrast, say that same homeowner sold their home, and purchased a similarly priced home in March 2024 at the current interest rate of 6.91 percent. The homeowner would face total payments of $961,214.41, with interest amounting to $556,214.41.

The difference is clear. ""Losing out on hundreds of thousands in interest savings for a $10,000 tax credit is just not worth it,"" Kipp said.

Opting for Biden's tax credit and selling the home to secure a new mortgage at a higher rate would result in an additional $339,656.60 in interest payments, far overshadowing the offered $10,000 incentive.

This is the ""lock-in"" effect, and according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the number of homeowners experiencing it is rising.

The effect, defined as a situation where rising mortgage rates discourage homeowners from selling due to the prospect of forfeiting that low-rate mortgage for significantly higher rates, has tangible impacts on housing mobility, market supply, and ultimately, home affordability, the FHFA said in a report issued earlier this week.

The report found that nearly all active mortgages in the U.S. are fixed-rate, with most of the loans featuring interest rates considerably lower than current market rates. The disparity creates a strong disincentive for selling, according to the agency's findings. ""For every percentage point that market mortgage rates exceed the origination interest rate, the probability of sale decreases by 18.1 percent.""

Consequently, the lock-in effect has led to a 57 percent reduction in home sales involving fixed-rate mortgages in the last quarter of 2023 alone, according to the FHFA, preventing over 1.3 million sales between the second quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023.

The supply constraint, fueled by the reluctance to sell, has inflated home prices by 5.7 percent, the FHFA said, overshadowing the direct impact of higher rates, which would typically depress prices.

However, there are still buyers, even with high rates and prices. Last month's existing- home sales jumped by 9.5 percent, marking the largest monthly increase of existing- home sales in a year, according to a National Association of Realtors report issued Thursday.

PwC, the trustee overseeing disgraced mortgage broker Greg Martel's bankruptcy, has gone to bat for investors with the Canada Revenue Agency to try to relieve some of the pressure investors have been feeling.

In an email to investors sent this week, PwC said it had heard back from the federal agency which has provided some guidance ""for investors who wish to pause collection activities that may be currently underway.""

Several of Martel's investors had complained they were facing tax bills and then collection proceedings initiated by the CRA.

A number of them shared with the Times Colonist that their T-5 forms, used to report interest and investment income from non-registered investments, stated they had income from investments made with ­Martel, even though Martel had stopped sending cheques.

Essentially, they were being taxed on investment money they don't have and that has gone missing along with Martel.

The Canada Revenue Agency suggested investors have two options.

First off they can file an objection which will preserve their right to an impartial review by the CRA that will consider underlying facts and circumstances. When an objection is filed the CRA normally postpones collection action on the amount in dispute, though interest will still accrue on unpaid balances owed.

The other option is for an investor to request an adjustment to their tax return to change amounts entered on specific lines. Those requests do not result in the CRA postponing collection activity.

Many investors are hoping the funds-flow analysis the trustee is undertaking will show where all of the money Martel took from investors went.

The analysis is being done to determine if the bridge loans Martel claimed to have arranged ever existed and if there is money sitting in an account somewhere that could offset investors' losses.

On the other hand, the analysis may prove that Martel was operating a Ponzi scheme -- a fraud where existing investors are paid with money from new investors -- which many investors believe will give the CRA official licence to re-evaluate the taxable income.

PwC has told investors and creditors, who claim Martel owes them in excess of $300 million, that it has made significant progress on the funds-flow analysis.

PwC wrote this week it expects that analysis will determine the cash invested by and cash distributed to each investor.

The analysis will track more than 50,000 transactions through 40-plus accounts at various financial institutions.

Those transactions represent more than $295 million in short‑term loan investments Martel had been offering through his company My Mortgage Auction.

To date the receiver has found no proof the loans ever existed.

PwC believes there are other investors who have not yet come forward and anticipates more than 1,300 investors could be tied up in the scheme, which it estimates involves nearly $300 million.

To date, the receiver has recovered only a small fraction of that.

Martel's whereabouts are unknown. Warrants for Martel's arrest have been issued in Canada and the U.S.

The B.C. Securities Commission is also investigating.

Grimes, a native of South Carolina, became a significant legal figure handling civil rights cases.

The US Attorney press release on the case is shown below -

LOS ANGELES - A federal grand jury has indicted Los Angeles attorney Milton C. Grimes with the evasion of payment of his individual income taxes and willful failure to pay taxes, the Justice Department announced today.

The indictment filed Thursday afternoon charges Grimes with one count of attempted tax evasion and four counts of willful failure to pay taxes. He is expected to be arraigned in United States District Court on April 10.

According to the indictment, Grimes owed the IRS more than $1.7 million in taxes for tax years 2010 and 2014. The IRS tried to collect the unpaid taxes from Grimes by, among other things, levying his personal bank accounts. In response to IRS collection efforts, from 2014 through 2020, Grimes allegedly engaged in a scheme to thwart the tax levies by keeping his personal bank account balances low. Grimes deposited the money he earned from representing clients into his law firm's business bank accounts, and then he routinely purchased cashier's checks and withdrew cash from those business bank accounts, the indictment states. By not depositing income earned into his personal accounts, Grimes allegedly avoided IRS collection efforts. With this scheme, Grimes allegedly withdrew approximately $16 million in funds from the business accounts in cashier's checks during those years, rather than paying the amount owed to the IRS.

Grimes also allegedly filed individual income tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021 reporting that he owed approximately $700,000 in taxes. Grimes allegedly did not, and has not, paid the taxes that he self-reported he owes.

In total, Grimes is alleged to have caused a tax loss of approximately $2,418,050 to the IRS.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

If convicted, Grimes faces up to five years in prison for the tax evasion count and up to one year in prison for each count of willful failure to pay taxes. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the United States Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

IRS Criminal Investigation is investigating this matter.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",timescall.com,news,Longmont Times-Call,,0.05882352941176472,448842769,1,https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

A 2023 story detailed how this led to pay going from about $75,000 to $173,000 for council members and from roughly $100,000 to $231,000 for the mayor. Backers said this would lead to better candidates and thus better governance. This theory held appeal to voters after 2016's $100 million-plus debacle in which Mayor Kevin Faulconer and the City Council (including current Mayor Todd Gloria) agreed without an appraisal to buy an Ash Street office tower -- a decrepit 19-story building that a previous owner had determined to be unusable.

But on March 12, San Diego's leaders again confirmed their oblivousness. That's when seven council members, at Gloria's behest, made the incomprehensible decision to spend up to $4.5 million to get recommendations on what to charge for trash pickup and recycling services. These issues are not complicated. Having taxpayers fork over millions of dollars to a consultant to address such a mundane topic instead of having city staff tackle the issue is bizarre -- especially in a city with more than 1,600 employees receiving annual total pay and benefits of more than $250,000, per Transparent California. Couldn't some of them be tasked with looking at best practices in other cities? Wouldn't that be obvious to most politicians -- and to sane people in general? Well, of course.

Which brings us to Wednesday's unanimous vote by a City Council committee to ask residents to approve an increase in the city sales tax rate from 7.75 percent to 8.75 percent in November. Gloria and council members are right when they say city finances are in a difficult spot. But when they ascribe this to the public's demand for services -- and ignore decades of city mismanagement -- they invite and deserve hoots of derision.

The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board will wait for now before taking a specific stand on the sales tax hike. This view is driven in particular by the profound shortcomings of the city's stormwater infrastructure and the likelihood it will lead to encores of January's storm-driven misery in southeast San Diego unless it is addressed.

But if voters refused to vote for the tax hike unless the trash consulting contract is canceled, they would be justified. If they voted no because City Hall still can't be trusted to protect taxpayers instead of public employee unions when it comes to pension costs, they would be justified. If they voted no because of their perception that the city spends money without caring if it actually is having the intended positive effect, they would be justified. An editorial board member who heads to Mira Mesa many weekends to enjoy the area's eclectic restaurants has gone more than a year without seeing a bike lane being used on Mira Mesa Boulevard.

In short, city leaders have a credibility gap as yawning as the Grand Canyon and as big as Ayers Rock. If the sales tax hike fails, it's on them.",sandiegouniontribune.com,news,San Diego Union-Tribune,,0.2156862745098038,448842712,1,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5df88f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6510x3662+0+294/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fde%2F9ea1dcae45bfb5337c166111a484%2F975664-sd-me-ash-st-settlement-009.jpg,

Lawmakers are offering tax incentives to restaurants and bars to buy from local breweries.

But the Georgia Craft Brewers' Guild told Channel 2's Richard Elliot that those incentives may not help here.

The guild said they appreciate any help they can get but insists they're still struggling because the Georgia legislature didn't help them this year.

The taps are open at Glover Park Brewery in Marietta. Kevin McNerney is the owner and brewmaster.

He says they're doing well but recognizes a lot of small breweries aren't.

""It's affecting small breweries, breweries that are recovering after COVID because clearly, we're all still recovering from that, trying to put the pieces together,"" McNerney said.

Now the United States Congress is considering legislation called the CHEERS Act. It would expand tax incentives to restaurants and bars if they invest in energy-efficient draft lines and keg equipment and encourage them to buy products from local small breweries.

""Every little bit helps,"" said Joseph Cortes, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers' Guild.

Cortes told Elliot that he appreciates the federal help, but he said it may not do much good in Georgia even if passed.

They worked this legislative session to get a bill passed that would have allowed local breweries to sell directly to local restaurants and retailers, bypassing the traditional large distributors. But that bill never made it out of committee.

So even if Congress is giving incentives to restaurants and retailers to buy local craft beer, state law, he said, isn't letting them sell it to them.

""This CHEERS Act in Congress seems like a small step forward, but we're looking for real relief and reform here in Georgia that will be meaningful,"" Cortes said.

Four years after a brush with bankruptcy, the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia may become part of the Smithsonian Institution.

While the Weitzman already has an affiliation with the Smithsonian, becoming one of the nearly 20 museums under the Washington, DC-based organisation's umbrella would make it eligible for federal appropriations, and bring heightened visibility and prestige. On 20 March, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in both chambers of the US Congress introduced legislation to review the Weitzman's potential as a Smithsonian outpost. The bill would create a commission of nine people to study the move's feasibility, reporting to congress on their findings within two years of the commission's launch.

""Educating all Americans, from all over the country, about these amazing Jewish impacts on our nation's history, not only raises awareness but helps dispel harmful prejudices about our community,"" representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents an area north of Miami, said in a press release.

Other sponsors of the bill include senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and representative Brendan Doyle, all Democrats from Pennsylvania; representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican; senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican; senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and senator Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada.

At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the museum filed for bankruptcy protection to offset a $30m construction debt. It was bailed out in 2021 by a donation from footwear magnate Stuart Weitzman. The Weitzman, which, like Smithsonian museums, offers free admission, is now financially stable.

The museum's chief executive, Misha Galperin, announced last November that he would be stepping down in 2024. In a statement, he said: ""A Smithsonian museum representing the American Jewish experience would serve as a resounding public endorsement that Jews belong in and are embraced by this nation.""

Museums operating under the Smithsonian trust's umbrella use a combination of federal appropriations and fundraising to remain free and open to the public. While most reside in Washington, DC, some, like the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, function beyond the National Mall.

A new generation of Smithsonian institutions at various stages of development are focused on chronicling the experiences and achievements of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the US, from the National Museum of African American History and Culture that was inaugurated in 2016, to museums devoted to American Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific islanders, LGBTQ+ individuals and women.

The proposed legislation comes at an exceptionally fraught moment for American Jews, many of whom were deeply affected by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, in which around 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage. Israel's military response to that attack, which has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians in the Gaza strip according to local health officials and pushed the devastated enclave to the brink of famine, has been very divisive for Jews in the US, with some supporting Israel's attacks while others call for a ceasefire.",theartnewspaper.com,news,The Art Newspaper,Torey Akers,0.192156862745098,448842271,1,"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/357125b9a83319bcba14de234190dc6b3677bd4b-2000x2000.jpg?rect=0,400,2000,1200&w=1200&h=720&q=85&fit=crop&auto=format",eng-9414571

This need is reflected in the considerable evidence of our failure to meet SDG target 15.2 -- to halt deforestation by 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, the world lost forests equivalent to the land area of Spain, totaling 50 million hectares (ha).

The scale of forest conversion to agricultural land is evident, with cattle, palm oil, and soy estimated to account for about 80% of tropical deforestation worldwide. The EUDR focuses on the seven most destructive agricultural commodities in terms of deforestation: cattle, coffee, cocoa, palm oil, rubber, soy, and wood. This conversion often incurs costs for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

The Regulation, effective from June 2023, will mandate EU importers to verify starting 31 December 2024, that covered agricultural commodities are legally sourced and not from post-2020 deforested land. This entails due diligence for compliance proof and disclosing production geolocation.

Deforestation in Thailand is less severe than in the past, with the country's forest area remaining stable at around 31.6% over the last decade. Nevertheless, many parts of the country still experience pressures, as seen in the loss of over 49,000 ha in 2021, compared to over 350,000 ha annually from 1973 to 1998. This progress reflects the important government efforts, supported by various partners, particularly civil society.

Thailand, a major producer of commodities like rubber (the world's largest) and palm oil (third largest globally), exported approximately $1.83 billion worth of EUDR commodities to the EU in 2022. Rubber accounted for the largest share, totaling $1.7 billion, constituting 11.5% of Thailand's total rubber exports. However, the country's export of the other EUDR commodities to the EU are all a small share of the total exports of these commodities.

Smallholders, essential in agricultural production in Southeast Asia, face challenges in generating sustainable income due to factors such as climate change, fluctuating prices, costs, and demand. With approximately 1.7 million rubber and 364,000 palm oil smallholders in Thailand, covering roughly 4 million ha and 1 million ha of plantations, respectively, their role is vital.

Moreover, nearly 800,000 households cultivate agricultural commodities in state-designated forest land (National Reserved Forests), which is theoretically illegal. Consequently, these households may struggle to export to the EU if their products fall under the regulated commodities.

Thailand also faces a critical deforestation risk in imports of EUDR commodities, including $3.2 billion of soy imported from Brazil in 2022. Additionally, it imports a large amount of non-EUDR commodities linked to deforestation. For example, in 2022, Thailand imported nearly $415 million of maize from Myanmar and over $283 million of cassava from Cambodia -- both commodities are major drivers of forest loss in these countries. According to the FAO, Cambodia lost 8.8% of its forests between 2015 and 2020, while Myanmar lost 4.8% in the same period.

Thailand's deforestation footprint overseas is important not only due to the EUDR's requirements for importers to ensure deforestation-free supply chains, but also because of the expected expansion of commodities covered by the EUDR beyond its current seven.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,-0.08235294117647063,448842200,1,,

State Representative Bob Merski says they have made a big first step, but they still have a long way to go.

The Pennsylvania Environmental and Renewable Energy Committee passed a bill Tuesday sponsored by Merski.

The idea is to enable the state to lease land for water, solar, or wind energy on Lake Erie.

""As the technology advances and we can move toward renewables, we can then decrease some of the fossil fuels that are polluting the environment, but I think this is a step that they are doing in other places,"" said Merski.

This bill was originally championed by State Representative Curt Sonney and then continued by Merski after Sonney's retirement.

""Everybody was at the table putting in their input and taking things out that they thought were bad things, so we feel that this bill protects the environment in a way that strengthens it from the original bill,"" said Merski.

""This action, if adopted, would help advance Pennsylvania's clean energy goals,"" said Matt Walker, advocacy director for the Clean Air Council. ""It can benefit the health of Pennsylvanians and provide good paying jobs.""

One Ohio-based foundation supports renewable energy but raised some environmental concerns after studying a previous wind turbine project.

""The cables that are laid on the floor of the lake from the wind turbines to the city, all those impacts have to be assessed on what the result will be to those different parts of the environment,"" said Matt Fisher, Lake Erie Foundation.

Fisher also brought up concerns with temporary jobs, cost and the lake's overall beauty.

""We love Lake Erie, and this is going to turn Lake Erie into an industrial park and I don't think that's what we want to do,"" said Fisher.

""These are government institutions, they'll do what the government wants. This raises the question of whether in a democracy, institutions operate as instruments and are working as instruments to please the BJP. They are creating false cases to make records globally. They are not only making records globally but also creating records of false cases. The BJP is setting records in creating false cases worldwide,"" said Akhilesh Yadav.

The Enforcement Directorate arrested Kejriwal in connection with the Delhi excise policy case on Thursday night, in which two senior AAP leaders are already in judicial custody.

He raised concerns about the extent to which institutions are being manipulated to serve the interests of the ruling party, asserting that whoever holds power utilizes these institutions.

""Previously, whoever was in power used these institutions, and now the BJP is doing it ten times more. What remains of the credibility of these institutions? In a democracy, whoever comes to power has the responsibility to improve institutions. Today, the common people know very well that the ED, CBI, and income tax are working for the BJP. And ever since the revelation of electoral bonds, the public has understood how they have extorted through intimidation. It's not donations; it's extortion. Companies are giving thousands of crores. Ultimately, those in power are benefiting. Political opposition parties are not receiving funds because they are in opposition. The opposition receives donations, while those in power have extorted,"" said Akhilesh Yadav.

""To hide what the BJP has done with electoral bonds, these institutions--CBI, ED, and income tax--are being pushed forward,"" he added.

Regarding concerns over alliances ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Yadav remained steadfast in prioritizing the fight against the BJP.

He remarked, ""Many people want many things. Samajwadis have the responsibility to fight the BJP. This is not the time to please anyone,"" said Akhilesh Yadav.

Earlier on Thursday the Samajwadi Party called off its ties with Apna Dal (Kameravadi) amid the differences between the alliance partners that had been playing out in public for a long time.

Responding to a media inquiry on Thursday, SP president Akhilesh Yadav said, ""We were in alliance with Apna Dal (Kameravadi) in the 2022 Assembly polls but it is not in 2024.""

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",akronnewsreporter.com,news,Akron News-Reporter,,0.05882352941176472,448841746,1,https://www.akronnewsreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

With the approval of House Bill 3, primary residence homeowners (or their spouses) who are age 65 or over and have paid Wyoming property taxes for 25 years or more are eligible for an exemption of 50% of a property's value. It will go into effect Jan. 1, 2025, and last until July of 2027.

House Bill 45 imposes a 4% cap on year-to-year property tax increases for residential buildings and parcels, effective immediately.

Senate File 89 will increase an existing veterans tax exemption from $3,000 to $6,000 of assessed value, and allocates $8.2 million to the state treasurer to provide reimbursements to county treasurers.

Gordon also signed HB0004 - Property tax refund program, but vetoed one line item in the bill, abolishing the highest income bracket for the program. He explained in his announcement that the allocated $20 million would be ""insufficient"" to fund the program with the highest income category included.

""I want to thank the Legislature for answering the call and funding an expansion of this program, which helped more than 9,000 Wyoming families last year,"" Gordon said in a statement.

Gordon did not approve every property tax bill. He vetoed SF0054 - Homeowner tax exemption, noting in his explanation that it might harm the ""financial stability of the state and counties...

The government has approved a bill to regulate cryptocurrency service providers, a significant development for Estonia's cryptocurrency landscape. This decision marks a crucial step towards comprehensive oversight of the burgeoning crypto sector within the country. However, the bill's journey to becoming law hinges on a successful parliamentary vote.

Supervision by the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA)

Under the proposed legislation, cryptocurrency service providers would fall under the supervision of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA), a move designed to bolster regulatory oversight and enhance accountability within the industry. Currently, these providers operate under the purview of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and must adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

If the bill receives parliamentary approval and is enacted into law, the FSA will commence issuing licenses to cryptocurrency service providers starting in 2025. Existing FIU license holders will face a transition period, being required to apply for FSA licensing by the end of that year. Estonian Finance Minister Mart Võrklaev expressed confidence in the licensing process, emphasizing that serious service providers can obtain the requisite licenses from the Financial Supervisory Authority.

Heightened penalties for AML violations

One notable aspect of the proposed legislation is the introduction of substantially increased fines for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations. While the current national law allows fines of up to 40,000 euros ($43,450), the new bill could see penalties soar to as high as 5 million euros ($5.2 million). This significant escalation underscores Estonia's commitment to combating financial crimes and ensuring strict adherence to cryptocurrency regulations.

The bill aims to align Estonia with the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, a move that seeks to harmonize regulatory frameworks across member states. Furthermore, the proposed legislation would modify the securities prospectus requirement, reflecting Estonia's proactive approach towards regulatory evolution in line with broader European directives.

Estonia's crypto-friendly evolution

Estonia first positioned itself as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction in 2017, enacting legislation that facilitated the establishment and operation of cryptocurrency companies while streamlining registration processes, including introducing e-residency. However, the country implemented tighter regulations in 2020 following a non-crypto-related corruption scandal, signaling a shift towards a more cautious regulatory stance.

As Estonia progresses towards implementing comprehensive regulation for cryptocurrency service providers, stakeholders across the industry await the outcome of the forthcoming parliamentary vote with keen interest. With the potential for heightened penalties and closer supervision by the Financial Supervision Authority, the proposed legislation underscores Estonia's commitment to fostering a robust and compliant cryptocurrency ecosystem while aligning with evolving European regulatory standards.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,James Kinoti,0.3803921568627451,448841443,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Default_cryptocurrency_regulation_bill_1.jpg,eng-9416483

The SEC Chairman's remarks, made during an event at Columbia Law School, underscored the regulatory challenges posed by digital asset businesses that seek to operate outside the SEC's disclosure regime.

SEC Chairman doubles down on the need for crypto regulation

One of the key points raised by the SEC Chairman was the issue of certain participants in crypto securities markets attempting to avoid registration requirements, which are essential for ensuring mandatory disclosure to investors. This lack of registration, according to Gensler, results in a lack of necessary information being provided to investors, creating potential risks within the crypto markets.

The SEC Chairman noted that many would agree that the crypto markets could benefit from increased transparency and oversight. The SEC has been actively pursuing enforcement actions against companies in the crypto space that fail to register as exchanges or list unregistered securities. Notable cases include actions taken against major platforms like Coinbase Inc. and Binance.

Ongoing enforcement actions and regulatory challenges

These enforcement efforts reflect the SEC's commitment to upholding regulatory standards and protecting investors in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Of particular interest is the ongoing investigation into Ethereum (ETH) by the SEC, with discussions around potentially classifying ETH as a security, a classification that differs from Bitcoin's status.

This distinction highlights the complexities and nuances involved in regulating various digital assets within the broader crypto ecosystem. Looking ahead, Gensler's stance on the necessity of registration and mandatory disclosure in crypto markets is likely to face practical tests. Prometheum, a firm aiming to become an approved special-purpose crypto broker-dealer, is preparing to launch its business, indicating a willingness to navigate regulatory requirements.

Additionally, Coinbase has taken legal action, seeking a court mandate for the SEC to engage in crypto-specific rulemaking, showcasing industry efforts to address regulatory clarity and compliance challenges. Gensler's recent speech underscores the SEC's focus on addressing regulatory gaps and ensuring adequate investor protection within the crypto industry.

Ukraine aims to secure the purchase of two nuclear reactors from Bulgaria to bolster its energy capacity, with hopes of finalizing the agreement as early as June.

The head of Ukraine's nuclear company, Energoatom, revealed to Reuters the pressing necessity for supplementary power generation in light of the shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear facility housing six reactors.

The proposed deal entails installing the acquired reactors at Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant in the western region, equipped with Russian-designed components sourced from Bulgaria. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, underscored the significance of expediting negotiations, emphasizing the impending energy crisis and the vital role these reactors would play in mitigating it.

While negotiations between the Ukrainian and Bulgarian governments continue, Kotin expressed optimism regarding the likelihood of reaching a consensus by June. He outlined plans for the swift installation of the first reactor, setting a demanding timeline for its completion to address the pressing energy demands.

In addition to the procurement of reactors, Energoatom is also exploring collaborations with General Electric for the construction of essential turbine components, essential for reactor operation. The ambitious endeavor aims to bolster Ukraine's energy independence and resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges.

However, the negotiations have encountered hurdles, with Bulgaria initially seeking to revise the pricing terms for the reactors. Despite the price adjustments proposed by Bulgaria, Ukraine remains steadfast in its pursuit of an equitable agreement, prioritizing affordability amidst escalating energy demands.

The genesis of the proposed deal can be traced back to Bulgaria's earlier acquisition of the reactors for the planned Belene Nuclear Power Plant. In a strategic move, Bulgaria authorized the potential sale of these reactors to Ukraine, recognizing the imperative of bolstering regional energy security and cooperation.

Meanwhile, amidst the ongoing energy crisis exacerbated by the closure of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Ukraine remains resolute in its determination to restore the facility to operational status.

It keeps getting worse - Conservative Angle,"A plethora of federal agencies have spent well over $200 million attempting to alleviate homelessness in Washington state over the past 17 years, only for the number of people living on the streets to keep rising.

Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), among others, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since 2007 on grants to third parties intended to mitigate homelessness in Washington, federal spending data shows. Despite the nine-figure sum of taxpayer dollars spent, the number of homeless people in Washington grew by about 20% between 2007 and 2023, according to a report produced by HUD.

Washington had the third highest raw increase in its homeless population between 2007 and 2023, according to HUD. California and New York were the first and second highest, respectively.

An estimated 20,036 individuals were living in Washington without permanent shelter as of 2023, according to HUD. Washington's rate of homelessness was among the highest in the nation in 2023.

The federal government has over the years attempted to assist Washington state with its mounting homelessness problem, with little to show for it.

The federal government spent heavily in Washington state during the COVID-19 pandemic, only for the number of homeless individuals in the state to grow by 15.6% between 2020 and 2022, according to HUD.

For instance, the VA has given nearly $120 million to third-party organizations to assist homeless veterans since 2007, much of which was paid out during the pandemic, according to federal spending records. Despite this injection of cash, Washington had the fifth-highest rate of veterans experiencing unsheltered homelessness as of 2023, according to HUD.

Unsheltered homelessness refers to people who primarily spend their nights at ""a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for people,"" according to HUD.

In a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation, a spokesperson for the VA acknowledged that the number of homeless veterans increased in Washington between 2022 and 2023.

In response to the increase, ""VA health care systems covering Washington State (Puget Sound, Spokane, Walla Walla and Portland) housed a combined total of 2,238 homeless Veterans,"" the spokesperson told the DCNF.

""This was possible, in part, due to nearly $15.6 million in grants and contracts awarded to local organizations.""

Some states, like Texas and Florida, reduced their homeless populations during the pandemic, according to HUD. Florida saw homelessness drop by 5.6% and Texas reduced its homeless population by 10.3%.

In addition to growing, Washington's homeless population also lacks access to temporary shelters at higher rates than most the country.

Washington had the ninth-highest rate of homeless people lacking temporary shelter, according to HUD. High rates of unsheltered homelessness in Washington persist despite considerable federal spending aimed at providing them with places to stay.

HUD has spent over $70 million in Washington on its emergency shelter grant program for the homeless since 2007, federal spending records show. HUD spent a further $60 million in Washington implementing its supportive housing program for the homeless.

""In the most recent System Performance Measures, communities across the country have seen reduced lengths of stay in homelessness and low rates of returns to homelessness,"" HUD told the DCNF when asked about its grant spending.

""By and large, the recent rise in homelessness in most communities is more attributable to the rise in the number of people who are becoming newly homeless, than any challenges with system performance.""

Officials have cited rising rents and the end of pandemic-era housing assistance and protections as contributing to the recent rise in homelessness, The Associated Press reported.

Many vulnerable people are living on the streets in Washington, despite federal funds being allocated to provide them with permanent housing.

Washington has a sizable population of young people living on the street, according to HUD. There were 2,026 homeless people under the age of 25 unaccompanied by a parent or guardian in Washington as of 2023.

The number of unaccompanied homeless youths in Washington grew by 12.4% between 2022 and 2023, according to HUD. The Seattle area had the third-highest number of unaccompanied homeless youths in the country in 2023.

Between 2022 and 2023, HUD spent more than $7 million in Washington through its youth homelessness demonstration program, which was intended to alleviate homelessness among young people by providing the population with assistance in acquiring housing or shelter.

Homelessness in Washington is not distributed uniformly across the state.

Roughly half of Washington's homeless reside in the Seattle area, according to HUD. The federal government has, in recent years, targeted the region in an attempt to quell homelessness.

HUD approved over $40 million in funding for the King County Regional Homeless Authority between 2022 and 2023, according to federal spending records. The King County Regional Homeless Authority is an independent government agency that relies on ""data, proven practices, and principles of social justice and racial equity"" to ""significantly decrease homelessness throughout King County,"" according to its website.

""Homelessness disproportionately harms people of color,"" the agency's website reads. ""We use an equity-based decision making framework to proactively dismantle structural racism and advance equity.""

The King County Regional Homeless Authority' total budget was $253.3 million in 2023, according to a document produced by the agency. The Seattle region had the third most homeless people of any area in the United States as of 2023, per HUD.

The influx of migrants and asylum seekers into Washington, rising living costs, a lack of shelter services and the end of pandemic aid are all contributing factors to rising homelessness in the state, University of Washington associate professor Gregg Colburn told the Seattle Times.

Despite recent setbacks, the majority of Seattle residents are optimistic that the city will make progress toward reducing homelessness over the next couple of years, according to a Seattle Times/Suffolk University poll conducted in June 2023.

The King County Regional Homeless Authority and HHS did not immediately respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.

Legislators voted 204-116 to defeat the motion introduced by Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who says the tax imposes too great a cost on Canadians.

Canada is aiming to cut emissions 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a steadily rising carbon price is a key part of the Liberals' climate plan. It is due to increase again on April 1 to C$80 ($59.13) a ton from C$65 a ton currently.

Trudeau's signature climate policy was introduced in 2019, but it has been opposed by most Canadian provinces. Last year, the government offered a three-year carbon tax exemption for home heating oil and higher carbon tax rebates for people in rural areas, to bring relief amid soaring costs of living.

The next federal election must be held by October 2025 and recent surveys of public opinion show the Conservatives will easily defeat the Liberals, who have been in office since November 2015.

""Justin Trudeau has created the worst economic conditions since the great depression and Canadians have lost faith in his government,"" the Conservative party said in a statement. ""Only Common Sense Conservatives will axe the tax and bring home lower prices for everyone,"" it added.

The Liberals only have a minority of seats in the House of Commons elected chamber and rely on support from the smaller left-leaning New Democrats, who voted to back the government.

The tax on fossil fuels is intended to accelerate a switch to clean energy. The government last month announced a new branding strategy to underscore that the policy means most people receive quarterly rebates.

""Pierre Poilievre and his Conservatives just tried to cut hundreds of dollars from Canadian families and roll back Canada's climate plan. We stopped them,"" the Liberal Party said in a tweet.

The funnyman told us trying to get his Middle Class Tax Refund was no joke.

His debit card, loaded with $350, never came. He eventually learned a scammer had stolen the card and drained the funds at a nearby ATM.

""I just don't like people getting away with things like this, or companies getting away with it,"" said George.

The same thing happened to Jay Ryan.

""It was stolen out of the mail, of course it was used. That's why criminals steal cards,"" he said.

The I-Team heard from dozens of consumers with the same problem. And they say trying to reach someone at Money Network, the company hired to run the program, was nearly impossible.

""I think one time I waited an hour and a half,"" said George.

And hundreds of thousands of consumers may have had the same problem.

The state auditor released a report saying Money Network failed to answer 900,000 of the two million calls from residents who wanted to speak with an agent about the program or problems with their cards.

And because of that, the auditor said it's impossible to track how much fraud occurred, even though, per its $25 million contract with the state, Money Network was supposed to limit the rate of fraud to one-percent.

Assemblymember Tom Lackey isn't happy with the audit results.

""Well it's clearly a failure. It's not a good grade,"" he said.

Lackey wants more accountability, especially since the state just signed another $32 million contract with Money Network to handle unemployment, or EDD, benefits.

""We should have an accountability piece in the contract that says they're going to respond better than they did in the past. These are accountability measures aren't rocket science,"" he said.

EDD told the I-Team things are different under this new contract. For starters, it's requiring Money Network to operate call centers 24/7, and 80% of the calls must be answered within 30 seconds.

The debit cards will also all contain a chip, something that hasn't been done in the past, which will make them harder for scammers to hack, and therefore, should reduce fraud.

""Total fraud is hard to eliminate. But we should clearly do a more responsible job in reacting to the problem,"" said Lackey.

In response to the audit, Money Network noted the auditor said it generally followed certain best practices for fraud management. Money Network also said it absorbed the cost of fraud.

The Franchise Tax Board, the agency in charge of the Middle Class Tax Refund, said this, in part, about the audit: ""We concur there are important lessons to be learned for any future large-scale financial relief programs.""

Most viewers who reached out to the I-Team about problems with their Middle Class Tax Refund did get their money back after we got involved.

But not everyone has used their cards. According to the audit report, more than one million debit cards, worth approximately $611 million, haven't been activated yet.

The audit did point out that the state and Money Network did a good job distributing the money quickly.

The Iowa Economic Development Authority board approved the tax abatements for the $576 million project, which has the potential to be the city's largest on record, and revealed that Google was the previously unnamed company behind it. Cedar Rapids approved a development agreement with the entity last month, the Gazette reported, for the construction of one or more data centers on the city's far north side near the Eastern Iowa Airport.

But in an email to the Des Moines Register on Friday, a Google spokesperson said plans have yet to be finalized.

""We are always planning for future capacity needs,"" it said. ""These are complex projects and development of the site is subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to competitive energy rates along with a sustainable and sufficient energy supply.""

The project would create 31 jobs paying at least $31.44 per hour. The IEDA granted Cedar Rapids the ability to leverage the High Quality Jobs program -- which provides tax credits and refunds to businesses that move to or expand in Iowa -- to give Google a break on property taxes that would otherwise increase with the completed data center's assessed value.

The company's exemption would last for a period of 20 years, an IEDA report said. The state has yet to dole out any funds for the center.

If Google does proceed, construction could begin this summer, with hiring expected to take place in 2025. The center would be fully functional by 2026.

""We're very excited about the project today, but also for what has occurred and what will occur in Cedar Rapids over the coming years,"" City Manager Jeff Pomeranz told the IEDA board. ""We're really, from an economic development perspective, (going) in a very, very positive direction.""

Google first came to Iowa in 2007 with a multimillion-dollar data center in Council Bluffs. In 2022, the company invested another $600 million in its already $5 billion, 1,000-acre complex, bringing its total workforce to 281.

Microsoft and Meta have joined it in Iowa, building data centers in locations including Altoona and West Des Moines. Apple began preparing for construction of a 400,000-square-foot data center in Waukee in 2021.

Factors that make the state attractive to tech companies include an abundance of inexpensive, environmentally friendly wind energy, access to high-speed fiber optic connections and tax incentives.

The IEDA noted that Google's infrastructure requirements have increased as its customer base and demand for services have grown. The company announced earlier in March that it would be investing $1 billion in a new data center in Kansas City, Missouri, with Google executive Monique Picou saying it will play an essential role in supporting the company's artificials intelligence innovations.

Korby Gilbertson of Lincoln outlined the ""EPIC Option"" plan's likely consequences Thursday at a forum sponsored by the Lincoln County Board of Realtors.

""Make this decision for yourself. Do the math yourself,"" she told about 35 people at Harbor Lights, near Lake Maloney south of North Platte. ""Think not just of yourself but of the state as a whole.""

Gilbertson is a leader of No New Taxes Nebraska, formed by more than 40 statewide groups and leaders to persuade people not to put a pair of constitutional amendments on the Nov. 5 general election ballot.

One would outlaw all taxes except ""retail consumption taxes"" or excise taxes. Property taxes, personal and corporate income taxes, current state and local sales taxes and county inheritance taxes all would be abolished as of Jan. 1, 2026.

The second says Nebraska ""shall impose a retail consumption tax or an excise tax on all new goods and services"" as of that date, except for used goods and ""grocery items purchased for off-premises consumption.""

The Legislature could let local governments adopt their own consumption taxes under the second constitutional amendment.

State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, a key petition-drive leader, has introduced consumption-tax plans in the Legislature four times since 2020.

He introduced both of the current petition drive's amendments in 2023, along with a more detailed ""enabling bill"" (Legislative Bill 79). None has advanced to the Unicameral floor, and all will die if not acted upon before the 108th Legislature adjourns April 18.

Gilbertson, a partner in veteran lobbyist Walter Radcliffe's Lincoln law firm, stressed that the consumption tax amendments would force the Legislature to impose at least a state consumption tax and apply it to ""all new goods and services.""

""The (Nebraska) Supreme Court has determined that if the language is plain on its face, you have to use that language"" and obey it, she said. ""It's not open to interpretation.""

She presented a lengthy list of affected people and groups that inevitably would find themselves paying higher-than-advertised consumption taxes.

Nebraskans would be taxed on their health care and medication and assisted-living and long-term care, Gilbertson said. Renters would be taxed on their rent; homeowners on mortgage services and new-home purchases; and families on their credit-card and child-care use and home and motor vehicle repairs.

College students, she added, would have to pay consumption taxes on tuition, books, housing and dormitory and cafeteria food. Even nonprofits and ""government entities"" would be charged consumption taxes, although it's unclear how the state could tax itself or the federal government, she said.

On the other hand, ""this is going to be the best thing ever for nonresident property owners,"" she said. ""They won't pay one dime of taxes in Nebraska.""

The amendments' effective date would leave state senators with only the 2025 regular Unicameral session to implement the consumption tax and retool state and local governments accordingly, Gilbertson said.

Erdman has said county assessors, the state Property Assessment Division and state and local employees involved with property taxes would no longer be needed with consumption taxes.

But Gilbertson said much of local governments' debt financing -- including bonds for construction projects and tax increment financing arrangements -- is tied to property or local sales taxes.

""The risk is that the minute this passes, we will default on all bonds, because the current stream of revenue is gone,"" she said.

A new study by the independent Tax Foundation agrees with a Nebraska-based research group that consumption-tax advocates have seriously underestimated the tax rate Nebraskans would need to face, Gilbertson said.

Erdman and other supporters regularly cite a February 2023 ""dynamic study"" by the Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research that calculated a consumption tax rate based on surges in economic activity it expects with the other taxes abolished.

The Beacon Hill study contends that the state could impose a single ""revenue-neutral"" 7.23% rate to replace ""current state and local taxes by a state consumption tax.""

That might take care of state government's functions, Gilbertson said. But the Tax Foundation study holds that Nebraska would need a combined state and local consumption tax rate of 21.6%, roughly the rate offered last year by Lincoln's OpenSky Policy Institute.

Because the proposed amendments would let local governments adopt their own consumption taxes, ""the total rate could be much higher than advertised"" by the idea's backers, said study authors Jared Walczak and Manish Bhatt.

Instead of newly robust economic activity, they added, EPIC likely would lead Nebraskans living near state lines to cross them to pay lower sales taxes in nearby states. Residents in the state's interior couldn't do so as easily.

While the Legislature could decide the mechanics of consumption taxes, Gilbertson said, LB 79 shows that supporters would prefer to impose them at the expense of local control.

An amendment to the bill that Erdman proposed in February 2023 would set up five statewide districts, tied to a pair of statewide boards to review approved local government budgets. One board would oversee K-12 schools and the other the remaining local governments.

Existing county boards in each district would elect a ""district representative"" to each statewide board, who ""shall have authority to make any necessary revisions to the (approved) budget proposal"" if it doesn't satisfy a manual governing consumption taxes to be written by the state boards.

""Proponents will tell you that this does not eliminate local control,"" Gilbertson said. ""The closest I can come to (understanding) this is they don't think there's any local control right now.""

The 2023 Measure A Annual Report from the Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) is now available to the public.

The 2023 Annual Report celebrates the 15-year anniversary of the Measure A approval by voters - the region's ½-cent transportation sales tax.

The report provides an in-depth look into the progress and milestones achieved over the past year within Santa Barbara County under the Measure A program.

Measure A has been instrumental in funding transportation projects aimed at improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting sustainable transportation options for all county residents.

The 2023 report shares information on the use of funds across various projects, including road improvements, public transit enhancements, and bicycle and pedestrian pathways.

Highlights from the report include:

* $132.4 million Senate Bill 1, Cycle 3 award for the Santa Barbara U.S. 101 Multimodal Corridor project.

* Groundbreaking partnership paving the way for Guadalupe's safer roads.

* Ventura County resident who finds a stress-free commute with the Coastal Express bus service.

* Santa Barbara MTD launches 19x: new express bus service to alleviate congestion.

* Introducing a new way to think about incentivizing commuters.

The report also introduces a stand-alone infographic insert to visually represent the fiscal profile revenues and expenditures for a clearer understanding of the Measure A impact.

""This year's report underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability in the stewardship of Measure A funds,"" said Marjie KIRN, executive director of SBCAG. ""As we reflect on 15-years since the vote for Measure A, we look to the future with optimism and confidence in continuing our collaborative work to make our community more connected and sustainable.""

And if you're a pet-free household, then you've definitely cooked a dinner or two - or had a takeout - and the smell also lingers.

Thankfully though, a common kitchen waste item can effectively eliminate these foul-smelling odours, according to an expert. So if you have coffee in your home, you're in luck.

According to Terry Fisher of Sold.co.uk: ""Coffee grounds are a fantastic natural deodoriser. They not only absorb odours but also emit a pleasant coffee aroma that can mask any lingering smells.""

How exactly do you put these coffee grounds to work? Sharing the simple method, Terry explained: ""Start by spreading a thin layer of used coffee grounds onto a baking sheet and allow them to dry out completely.

""Once done, transfer the coffee grounds into small bowls or sachets made from breathable fabric, like muslin or cheesecloth. Next, strategically place these coffee ground sachets around your home - focusing on areas prone to odours, such as the kitchen, living room, or pet beds.

""As the coffee grounds absorb the odours, they'll also release their own delightful scent, leaving your home smelling fresh and inviting.""

Potent smells can often cling stubbornly to furniture upholstery, curtains, cushions and other household surfaces. This not only makes it tough for homeowners but also puts them at risk of getting used to the smells, leading to a condition known as nose-blindness.

The secret behind coffee grounds' odour-fighting power lies in their chemical composition. Terry said: ""Coffee grounds contain nitrogen, which helps break down and neutralise odorous compounds. Additionally, their porous texture allows them to trap and absorb unpleasant smells, leaving behind a cleaner and fresher environment.""

But it's not just about a pleasant home environment. Terry points out that this hack is also a game-changer for those looking to sell their homes as odd smells can deter potential buyers.

Stressing that first impressions are everything, the expert says that a home that smells fresh and inviting immediately sets a positive tone for potential buyers.

He concluded: ""By taking simple steps to eliminate bad smells using natural methods like coffee grounds, sellers can significantly enhance their home's appeal and stand out in a competitive market.

While deciding three of the seven writ petitions filed by Congress on Friday, Justices Yashwant Varma and Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav factored in tax department's contention that over Rs 520 crore may have escaped assessment.

The opposition party had filed seven writ petitions against tax department, which is seeking to conclude the ongoing reassessment for seven financial years - 2013-14 to 2020-21 - by March 31, an exercise which can result in I-T demand on the assesse being raised if evasion is established. The highest amount of around Rs 349 crore relates to financial year 2019-20.

Details of I-T department's 'satisfaction note', running into 300 pages, have not been revealed, there are several references to cash transactions that were undertaken, with funds allegedly delivered to 24, Akbar Road, which houses Congress headquarters.

For instance, searches on Megha Engineering revealed 10 diary entries showing cash payments of close to Rs 26 crore to Akbar Road between Feb 28, 2019, and Oct 1, 2019. According to details in court order, in his statement, one P V Sunil ""accepted"" that he had paid amounts at 24, Akbar Road.

Similarly, a scrap sales diary seized from office of Western UP Power Transmission Co Ltd, a Megha Engineering subsidiary, also allegedly showed payments of Rs 10.5 crore. Loose papers are said to have contained details of unaccounted cash from the transmission company.

The court order also provides a list of alleged transactions recovered during raids on Kakkar-Miglani group, who are said to be key aides of ex-MP CM Kamal Nath. Evidence collected shows that ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, public works department allegedly contributed funds to Congress. There are some entries related to energy department too.

Efforts of an income tax team, which was pursuing cash couriers, to search Congress office just before last Lok Sabha elections had touched off a political controversy, with the then party treasurer rushing to 24, Akbar Road to argue with tax officials who were keen on questioning one S M Moin. HC order showing satisfaction with I-T department's findings can intensify the fight on political contributions to parties.

Besides, documents submitted by I-T department in court showed payments of Rs 17 crore to AICC and an alleged transfer of Rs 20 crore from residence of Kamal Nath to AICC head office.

There is mention of 'payments' to various MLAs as well as a payment of Rs 90 lakh to another ex-MP CM.

Further, before 2018 assembly polls in MP, files found on laptop of one Lalit Chhallani contained an Excel sheet mentioning that AICC had allegedly been given Rs 33 crore.",timesofindia.indiatimes.com,news,The Times of India,,0.1058823529411765,448839826,1,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108717924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35524,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",eng-9419018

Major uranium producer Kazatomprom (LSE:KAP,OTC Pink:NATKY) released its financial results for 2023 this past Friday (March 15), showing a strong response to much-improved uranium market dynanics.

The company's consolidated revenue grew by KZT 1,434,635 million (US$3.19 billion), up 43 percent from 2022.

This robust performance was influenced by various factors. Firstly, the uranium sector experienced an overall improvement, with the average annual price increasing by slightly over 20 percent in 2023. The year was significant for the industry as a whole, with the commodity hitting 15 year highs and closing the year at US$90 per pound.

While Kazatomprom's U3O8 production experienced a slight 2 percent decline from 2022, its sales volume rose 10 percent. The company attributes this discrepancy to buyers choosing to ""flex up"" their purchases.

Kazatomprom CEO Meirzhan Yussupov also said that changes in energy security sentiment have led to increased demand for uranium as a stable, low-carbon energy source.

""The Company appreciates being a part of the energy security agenda. With the continuing global geopolitical uncertainty and risks, and continuous talks on the bifurcation of the market, Kazatomprom is located in an ESG-compliant and low-risk jurisdiction is fully capable of keeping its leadership position as a reliable supplier of natural uranium and is ready to secure utilities' needs in diversifying their supply sources,"" he said in a press release.

Kazatomprom's current market position also remains stable -- it said it is hedging the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict by receiving its revenue and financing in US dollars, mitigating currency risks.

However, the company is not without its struggles in production. Its 2024 guidance, which stood at 10,900 to 11,900 metric tons for 2024 as compared to last year's 11,169, was cut in February. The reduction in guidance is primarily attributed to difficulties in sourcing sulfuric acid, which plays a key role in uranium extraction through leaching.

Moving forward, Kazatomprom said it is fully committed to pursuing its role as a stakeholder in sustainable energy development. As part of its 2023 to 2030 agenda, the company has approved radioactive waste and water resource management policies to be integrated with its existing processes and operations.

Uranium's recent strong price action comes after a long slump caused by oversupply following the Fukushima nuclear accident. However, with the depletion of excess supply and growing global interest in nuclear energy, prices have improved.

Looking forward, Kazatomprom warned that it has concerns about the ability of uranium producers to meet demand.

""Although some of the producers made decisions to restart idled capacity and launch new production in the mid-2020s, including ourselves, it will not be sufficient to cover uranium requirements post-2030, especially amid current geopolitical uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and supply chain challenges worldwide,"" the firm said.

In anticipation, Yussupove said that Kazatomprom is focusing on launching various exploration programs and strengthening its reserve replenishment infrastructures, ""In the current pricing environment another Kazatomprom-sized supply source will be needed to cover future market needs,"" he said.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",oneidadispatch.com,news,Oneida Dispatch,,0.05882352941176472,448839513,1,https://www.oneidadispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

Locally, Jacksonville City Council members are proposing a resolution in support of that federal legislation, especially in light of crimes that have happened locally.

Hundreds of people marched in downtown Jacksonville earlier this month to bring awareness to how dangerous it's become to deliver mail.

""Our cry is is enough is enough,"" said Jim Thigpenn, representing about 1,200 city letter carriers in northeast Florida as the president of the local branch of the National Association Letter Carriers.

He said mail carriers have become a target for thieves in recent years.

""During COVID, a lot of people started coming up with different schemes, so it seems like there's an organized attack on letter carriers to get the keys that we carry that open up a lot of boxes, blue boxes, things like that,"" he said.

The U.S. Postal Service reported robberies on postal carriers rose nearly 30% last year to 643 with 61 of those leaving carriers hurt.

Robbers are after things like checks and personal information, including in Jacksonville. According to Thigpenn, last year there were a dozen smash and grabs on mail trucks, as well as six postal workers attacked on the job, including some held at gunpoint.

He said the psychological toll on mail carriers is intense.

""We've had two or three carriers that...have not even been able to go back out on the street...really has them second guessing everything, who's coming up to talk to them,"" Thigpenn said. ""That's not a thing that we've really had to deal with before.""

Congress has introduced legislation that aims to protect mail carriers from attacks by replacing the master mailbox keys thieves are after with more secure electronic boxes.

""We won't be a target as far as someone trying to get to all that mail with access to those keys,"" Thigpenn said.

The bill also calls for hiring more prosecutors and imposing harsher sentences on those who target mail carriers. According to the National Association of Letter Carriers, the legislation would provide $7 billion in funding from fiscal years 2025-2029.

To Jacksonville City Councilmember Rahman Johnson, it's a cause worthy of local support.

""This is where it happens,"" Johnson said.

To take action, he introduced a resolution to City Council so local lawmakers can symbolically show support to the letter carriers lobbying for the federal bill. The resolution does not involve any local funding.

""It's simply a resolution saying that the council believes that our letter carriers are important,"" Johnson said.

City Council will vote on the resolution Tuesday. If it passes and the mayor signs it, the resolution will then be sent to members of Jacksonville's Congressional delegation.",news4jax.com,news,News 4 Jax,Anne Maxwell,-0.1372549019607843,448839509,1,"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/4GFVZ5AHAVCSHHK6LKMKYHJZD4.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0",eng-9415716

The Nissan GT-R is an impossibly popular car on the Japanese sports car market. With all-wheel drive, multi-link suspension, and 330-horsepower this car quickly became one of the most popular race cars to hit Japan's roads. Of course, the ride was a bit heavier than most of the competition at the time at just over 3200 lbs (compared to like 2500 lbs), however the extra power and the fact that all that power was being put to the ground by all four wheels made up for that weight. If 3200 lbs doesn't sound like a lot to you, because American cars are known for having a little girth, think of the GT-R like the Japanese version of the Charger/Challenger - lots of power and as a result of a big engine, lots of weight.

Many reasons likely contribute to the GT-R's status, both current and past, but the V-spec II option is especially difficult to find. This is why it is astounding that our friends from Yourcarbro managed to find a G-TR V-spec II just sitting there, abandoned, alone, never to race again. One could only imagine what fun this car had seen before its untimely and unfortunate abandonment.

Could this have been the car of some poor soul longing for the exciting world of racing, an enthusiast who saw the car's potential before everybody else did, or just some kid who had a couple of grand to spend and ended up leaving it to rot for whatever reason? On any other ""normal"" car this story wouldn't be particularly exciting, however, this is one of the most coveted and lusted after cars on the Japanese domestic market. Hopefully, the day will come when this car is no longer left to rot but for now, it remains an old relic in a world that could care less whether it stays and withers away or is resurrected and allowed to tear through the streets once again.",ca.sports.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo Sports Canada,Elizabeth Puckett,0.1686274509803922,448839502,1,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7okOdViS.KvwRDtYJl5j0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motorious_297/e1c676d67f7744a2895cd54fda88923b,

The group, founded and led by former New York Times journalist Julie Scelfo, is called MAMA -- Mothers Against Media Addiction. They wore neon green beanies and held signs that said ""#KidsBeforeTech."" Many of its members, some of whom lost children after being exposed to harms through social media, had demonstrated in January during the U.S. Senate hearings around Big Tech and child safety. During the hearing, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg turned to them and said, ""I'm sorry for everything you've all gone through.""

""He actually looked me in the eyes for a few minutes and I thought 'You have no idea who I am,'"" Scelfo told NBC News in an interview after the rally, referring to Zuckerberg's acknowledgement of grieving parents during the Senate hearings. ""And who I am is someone who has for years been asking people to think more critically about how all these technologies are wreaking havoc with basic institutions in our democracy.""

The issues discussed by parents and child safety advocates at the Friday rally extended far beyond the aims of the New York state bills, with actress and author Sheetal Sheth, a MAMA member and event speaker, calling them the ""bare minimum"" of regulating Big Tech.

One parent, Mary Rodee, was holding a picture of her late son Riley, who died by suicide at age 15 in 2021 after being targeted with online sextortion on Facebook, she said.

""Nothing has changed in nearly three years since Riley's death,"" Rodee said.

Meta referred NBC News to its participation with the ""Take It Down"" initiative, introduced in 2023 alongside the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which provides aid to children who are being sexually extorted or have had intimate material featuring them posted online. Meta also pointed to its guidance for kids and parents around sextortion, its stricter standards for minors on Facebook Messenger and its Safety Notices within Instagram direct messages.

The two New York Senate bills were introduced by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who spoke at the protest. The bills are still waiting to advance from Senate committee. One is called the ""Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act"" and the other is called the New York child data protection act.

The ""SAFE"" act would require social media platforms to opt children out of algorithmic-driven feeds -- which it calls ""addictive"" -- and instead present chronological feeds of posts from accounts children follow, minus algorithm-suggested content. It would also prevent social media platforms from sending children notifications between midnight and 6 a.m. The New York child data protection act would prohibit online sites from ""collecting, using, sharing, or otherwise processing any personal data of individuals under the age of 18 without informed consent.""

Both bills would limit how social media companies can administer their products to children in New York state, as well as how those companies can profit from child users. The ""SAFE'' act would require social media companies to ""provide age verification methods all New Yorkers can use"" that do not collect biometric data or require government identification ""that many New Yorkers do not possess."" The child data protection act would not require age verification, but would instead require companies to rely on ""browser or device signals"" that indicate a user is a minor.

""This country is so far behind other countries in ensuring basic regulations,"" Scelfo said, referring to various laws that have been passed in Europe regulating social media platforms.

In the U.S., various pieces of proposed regulation on social media companies have failed or languished in Congress.

MAMA and the New York state bills the group is advocating for are part of a movement of proposed and enacted social media regulation at the state level, where advocates of Big Tech regulation have seen more success. For example, in Florida, a controversial state bill that would ban social media for kids under 16 even if they had their parents' permission passed the House in February. That bill contains similar language to the less restrictive New York bills, as well as similar proposals and laws in states like Arkansas, Texas, Ohio, New Jersey and California.

The Washington Post reported that MAMA is financially backed by the Center for Humane Technology nonprofit, which was behind the 2020 documentary ""The Social Dilemma."" The nonprofit has also advocated for the Kids Online Safety Act, federal legislation that proposes new obligations for social media companies to prevent children from being exposed to content deemed harmful. Critics say this bill threatens kids' First Amendment rights and puts the power to censor the internet in the hands of partisan state officials.

Big Tech companies and researchers have also challenged the idea that social media can be addictive, which is at the heart of the proposed ""SAFE"" act in New York City. While addiction is in MAMA's name, Scelfo said the group isn't making medical claims.

""I'm not a doctor, and MAMA is not using the word addiction in a clinical sense. However, we are using it to communicate the overarching problem in our society's addiction to media and technology,"" she said.

""We have screens everywhere now. And because of the internet and 24-hour, endless streams of content, we are inundating people's minds and hearts with more information than they can possibly process. We have screens in elevators, we have screens in waiting rooms, in restaurants, at gas pumps, and it is not good for human health.""",nbcnews.com,news,NBC News,,-0.1215686274509804,448839094,1,"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240322-Mothers-Against-Media-Addiction-ew-309p-65a4f2.jpg",

The judge, María Inmaculada Iglesias Sánchez, has accepted the prosecutor's complaint and will investigate the relationship partner of Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the People's Party (PP) president of the Community of Madrid, and will call him to testify. The judge considers that the public prosecutors' text, which asserts that González Amador's company wrote false invoices with the aim of ""reducing tax"", shows ""indicative evidence of participation in the criminal conduct that is the subject of the investigation"". The reaction of the Socialists (PSOE) was not long in coming. Through the social media X, the PSOE called on opposition leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo to ""immediately"" ask the Madrid president to resign: ""The time for turning away is over"".

The origin of all of this is a report from the Spanish tax agency, in which it was stated that González Amador's company had registered ""an increase in activity income "" after acting as an intermediary in ""an operation for the sale of medical equipment"". In addition, the Treasury asserted that the conduct discovered was not ""the result of a mere mistake"", but of ""conscious, deliberate and clearly malicious"" conduct that ""deserves criminal reprimand"". According to the judicial document made public this Friday, the prosecutors assert that, in the face of ""the increase in the volume of business it had experienced"" in 2020 and 2021, the company had ""improperly deducted expenses using invoices that did not correspond with services actually provided"".

The text estimated the alleged tax fraud at 155,000 euros in 2021 and 195,951.41 euros in 2021. In total, 350,000 million euros defrauded over face mask contracts. For this reason, the judge has now agreed to ""initiate preliminary proceedings and carry out the essentials aimed at determining the nature and circumstances of the fact and the people who participated in it"". She also called six other people, including two tax inspectors, to testify.

Just ten days ago, the Madrid provincial prosecutors offered Alberto Gonzáléz Amador a deal to plead guilty to two fiscal crimes and one of forgery: it was proposed that he admit the three crimes in exchange for a fine and a light prison sentence which in practice would not entering a jail. The next day it transpired that González Amador had admitted in a written statement on February 2nd that he had committed ""two crimes against the Treasury"". Despite this, Ayuso has defended him from the first day, repeating on several occasions that it is a ""murky case of all the powers of the state being used against an individual"".

However, the tax agency's report showed that the man who has been Ayuso's partner since 2021 used two companies without workers on the payroll, and without material to work with, only a computer and a printer. Nevertheless, the main company, Maxwell Cremona, which he used to bill 3.7 million euros in two years, had two high-end cars. The second firm, Masterman & Whitaker, was ""a mere intermediary company"" that also never had workers or material means to do the work for which it was commissioned.

With the release of all this information, just two days ago, a thousand people gathered in front of the PP headquarters on Calle Génova in Madrid to demand Ayuso's resignation. The protest combined outrage over these cases of corruption with the grievance over the deaths of 7,291 senior citizens resident in care homes during the pandemic. On Thursday, the Congress of Deputies gave the green light to the commission of inquiry into contracting during the pandemic, an investigation that could address both the Koldo case centred on the PSOE and the case of the partner of the PP politician who leads the Community of Madrid.",elnacional.cat,news,ElNacional.cat,,-0.09019607843137256,448838875,1,https://www.elnacional.cat/en/uploads/s1/46/21/76/19/ayuso-roda-de-premsa-desenfocada-efe_4_1258x630.jpeg,

WASHINGTON, DC -- Friday, Congressman August Pfluger's legislation to repeal the Natural Gas Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives as a part of H.R. 1023, the Cutting Green Corruption and Taxes Act.

Congressman Pfluger spoke on the House Floor in advance of the vote. Watch here or read excerpts of his remarks as prepared below.

""I rise in support of H.R. 1023, the Cutting Green Corruption and Taxes Act. I am proud that H.R. 1023 includes my legislation, H.R. 1141, to repeal the IRA's natural gas tax.

""The natural gas tax is inappropriate and highly unworkable. This tax was included despite never being considered in a hearing, receiving expert testimony, and, instead of looking at emissions holistically, the natural gas tax was based on the simple premise that if reliable energy is taxed, less of it will be produced.

""Especially as the EPA rolls out proposed rules to implement the natural gas tax, it is clear that Congress must take action to repeal this looming regulatory morass that targets all operators, no matter the size or actual emissions.

""I was pleased to host Speaker Johnson out to the Permian Basin to kick off Energy Week. The Speaker had the opportunity to meet with independent oil and gas producers who have worked proactively to reduce emissions.

""They haven't invested millions in emissions reduction technologies because of government penalties -- they have done it because it makes economic and environmental sense for them to do so. In fact, methane emissions intensity in the Permian dropped nearly 70 percent between 2011 and 2020, even as production rose by over 320 percent. Permian producers are diligently and responsibly leading the way.

""If implemented, the ill-conceived natural gas tax will handicap technological innovation, reduce supplies of affordable energy, and increase both costs and emissions. In fact, this tax alone will drive up the cost of household energy bills for the 180 million Americans and 5.5 million businesses that rely on natural gas.

""The underpinnings of our national security and economic prosperity rest on the abundant natural resources the United States boasts. Now more than ever, it is critical to prioritize our energy security and dominance by repealing the IRA's natural gas tax.

""I urge support for American energy production, and H.R. 1023. I yield back.""",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.223529411764706,448838787,1,,eng-9419475

Warner (D-VA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, introduced the Health Care Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2024, legislation that would allow for advance and accelerated payments to health care providers in the event of a cyber incident, as long as they and their vendors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The legislation follows a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare that has paralyzed billing services for providers nationwide, leaving many in danger of becoming financially insolvent.

""I've been sounding the alarm about cybersecurity in the health care sector for some time. It was only a matter of time before we saw a major attack that disrupted the ability to care for patients nationwide,"" said Sen. Warner. ""The recent hack of Change Healthcare is a reminder that the entire health care industry is vulnerable and needs to step up its game. This legislation would provide some important financial incentives for providers and vendors to do so.""

In rare situations, Medicare Part A providers (such as acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other inpatient care facilities) and Part B suppliers (including physicians, nonphysician practitioners, durable medical equipment suppliers, and others who furnish outpatient services) can face cash flow challenges due to specified circumstances beyond their control (for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic.) Since the 1980s, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided temporary financial relief to participants in these programs through Accelerated and Advance Payment (AAP) programs, during which these providers and suppliers receive advance payments from the federal government that are later recovered by withholding payment for subsequent claims.

The Health Care Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2024 would modify the existing Medicare Hospital Accelerated Payment Program and the Medicare Part B Advance Payment Program by:

These provisions would go into effect two years from the date of enactment. A copy of the bill text is available here.

In 2022, Sen. Warner authored ""Cybersecurity is Patient Safety,"" a policy options paper, outlining current cybersecurity threats facing health care providers and systems and offering for discussion a series of policy solutions to improve cybersecurity across the industry. Since publishing, Sen. Warner has launched the Health Care Cybersecurity Working Group with a bipartisan group of colleagues to examine and propose potential legislative solutions to strengthen cybersecurity in the health care and public health sector.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.3254901960784313,448838749,1,,

It keeps getting worse | WND | by Around the Web,"A plethora of federal agencies have spent well over $200 million attempting to alleviate homelessness in Washington state over the past 17 years, only for the number of people living on the streets to keep rising.

Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), among others, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars since 2007 on grants to third parties intended to mitigate homelessness in Washington, federal spending data shows. Despite the nine-figure sum of taxpayer dollars spent, the number of homeless people in Washington grew by about 20% between 2007 and 2023, according to a report produced by HUD.

Washington had the third highest raw increase in its homeless population between 2007 and 2023, according to HUD. California and New York were the first and second highest, respectively.

An estimated 20,036 individuals were living in Washington without permanent shelter as of 2023, according to HUD. Washington's rate of homelessness was among the highest in the nation in 2023.

The federal government has over the years attempted to assist Washington state with its mounting homelessness problem, with little to show for it.

The federal government spent heavily in Washington state during the COVID-19 pandemic, only for the number of homeless individuals in the state to grow by 15.6% between 2020 and 2022, according to HUD.

For instance, the VA has given nearly $120 million to third-party organizations to assist homeless veterans since 2007, much of which was paid out during the pandemic, according to federal spending records. Despite this injection of cash, Washington had the fifth-highest rate of veterans experiencing unsheltered homelessness as of 2023, according to HUD.

Unsheltered homelessness refers to people who primarily spend their nights at ""a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for people,"" according to HUD.

In a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation, a spokesperson for the VA acknowledged that the number of homeless veterans increased in Washington between 2022 and 2023.

In response to the increase, ""VA health care systems covering Washington State (Puget Sound, Spokane, Walla Walla and Portland) housed a combined total of 2,238 homeless Veterans,"" the spokesperson told the DCNF.

""This was possible, in part, due to nearly $15.6 million in grants and contracts awarded to local organizations.""

Some states, like Texas and Florida, reduced their homeless populations during the pandemic, according to HUD. Florida saw homelessness drop by 5.6% and Texas reduced its homeless population by 10.3%.

In addition to growing, Washington's homeless population also lacks access to temporary shelters at higher rates than most the country.

Washington had the ninth-highest rate of homeless people lacking temporary shelter, according to HUD. High rates of unsheltered homelessness in Washington persist despite considerable federal spending aimed at providing them with places to stay.

HUD has spent over $70 million in Washington on its emergency shelter grant program for the homeless since 2007, federal spending records show. HUD spent a further $60 million in Washington implementing its supportive housing program for the homeless.

""In the most recent System Performance Measures, communities across the country have seen reduced lengths of stay in homelessness and low rates of returns to homelessness,"" HUD told the DCNF when asked about its grant spending.

""By and large, the recent rise in homelessness in most communities is more attributable to the rise in the number of people who are becoming newly homeless, than any challenges with system performance.""

Officials have cited rising rents and the end of pandemic-era housing assistance and protections as contributing to the recent rise in homelessness, The Associated Press reported.

Many vulnerable people are living on the streets in Washington, despite federal funds being allocated to provide them with permanent housing.

Washington has a sizable population of young people living on the street, according to HUD. There were 2,026 homeless people under the age of 25 unaccompanied by a parent or guardian in Washington as of 2023.

The number of unaccompanied homeless youths in Washington grew by 12.4% between 2022 and 2023, according to HUD. The Seattle area had the third-highest number of unaccompanied homeless youths in the country in 2023.

Between 2022 and 2023, HUD spent more than $7 million in Washington through its youth homelessness demonstration program, which was intended to alleviate homelessness among young people by providing the population with assistance in acquiring housing or shelter.

Homelessness in Washington is not distributed uniformly across the state.

Roughly half of Washington's homeless reside in the Seattle area, according to HUD. The federal government has, in recent years, targeted the region in an attempt to quell homelessness.

HUD approved over $40 million in funding for the King County Regional Homeless Authority between 2022 and 2023, according to federal spending records. The King County Regional Homeless Authority is an independent government agency that relies on ""data, proven practices, and principles of social justice and racial equity"" to ""significantly decrease homelessness throughout King County,"" according to its website.

""Homelessness disproportionately harms people of color,"" the agency's website reads. ""We use an equity-based decision making framework to proactively dismantle structural racism and advance equity.""

The King County Regional Homeless Authority' total budget was $253.3 million in 2023, according to a document produced by the agency. The Seattle region had the third most homeless people of any area in the United States as of 2023, per HUD.

The influx of migrants and asylum seekers into Washington, rising living costs, a lack of shelter services and the end of pandemic aid are all contributing factors to rising homelessness in the state, University of Washington associate professor Gregg Colburn told the Seattle Times.

Despite recent setbacks, the majority of Seattle residents are optimistic that the city will make progress toward reducing homelessness over the next couple of years, according to a Seattle Times/Suffolk University poll conducted in June 2023.

The King County Regional Homeless Authority and HHS did not immediately respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",coloradohometownweekly.com,news,Colorado Hometown Weekly,,0.05882352941176472,448838661,1,https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

The SEC Chairman's remarks, made during an event at Columbia Law School, underscored the regulatory challenges posed by digital asset businesses that seek to operate outside the SEC's disclosure regime.

One of the key points raised by the SEC Chairman was the issue of certain participants in crypto securities markets attempting to avoid registration requirements, which are essential for ensuring mandatory disclosure to investors. This lack of registration, according to Gensler, results in a lack of necessary information being provided to investors, creating potential risks within the crypto markets.

The SEC Chairman noted that many would agree that the crypto markets could benefit from increased transparency and oversight. The SEC has been actively pursuing enforcement actions against companies in the crypto space that fail to register as exchanges or list unregistered securities. Notable cases include actions taken against major platforms like Coinbase Inc. and Binance.

These enforcement efforts reflect the SEC's commitment to upholding regulatory standards and protecting investors in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Of particular interest is the ongoing investigation into Ethereum (ETH) by the SEC, with discussions around potentially classifying ETH as a security, a classification that differs from Bitcoin's status.

This distinction highlights the complexities and nuances involved in regulating various digital assets within the broader crypto ecosystem. Looking ahead, Gensler's stance on the necessity of registration and mandatory disclosure in crypto markets is likely to face practical tests. Prometheum, a firm aiming to become an approved special-purpose crypto broker-dealer, is preparing to launch its business, indicating a willingness to navigate regulatory requirements.

Additionally, Coinbase has taken legal action, seeking a court mandate for the SEC to engage in crypto-specific rulemaking, showcasing industry efforts to address regulatory clarity and compliance challenges. Gensler's recent speech underscores the SEC's focus on addressing regulatory gaps and ensuring adequate investor protection within the crypto industry.

Cleary in the context of the FTX bankruptcy case. This exploration not only touches on the potential conflicts of interest by a law firm that played a pivotal role in guiding FTX through its bankruptcy but also reflects the broader implications for the legal and cryptocurrency industries.

The appointment of Robert J. Cleary to investigate the potential conflicts of interest involving Sullivan and Cromwell in the FT'X case marks a significant turning point in the legal scrutiny following the cryptocurrency exchange's dramatic downfall. This development, sanctioned by a U.S. bankruptcy judge, underscores the intensified focus on the actions and responsibilities of legal advisers in high-stakes financial collapses.

The central question of Cleary's investigation is what exactly transpired between Sullivan and Cromwell and FT'X leading up to and during the bankruptcy proceedings. With allegations of racketeering and misleading practices, there's a palpable tension within the cryptocurrency and legal communities about the potential findings. The investigation aims to shed light on the intricate details of Sullivan and Cromwell's advisory role, including any instances where the firm may have crossed ethical lines for financial gain.

The green light for Cleary's probe is more than a mere legal procedure; it's a symbol of the growing concerns over the ethical and financial stability of the cryptocurrency industry. The collapse of FT'X not only led to significant financial losses for investors globally but also raised serious questions about the sufficiency of current regulatory frameworks to prevent such disasters. An in-depth examination into how FTX's internal practices and its advisers' roles contributed to the company's downfall could have a lasting impact on how cryptocurrency businesses are regulated and scrutinized.

As the legal community and investors await Cleary's report, the focus extends beyond FTX's past missteps to the broader implications for legal advisors in the financial sector. This probe might serve as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the need for transparency and ethical integrity in legal advisement. For FTX, under its new leadership, the investigation represents an opportunity to distance itself from previous controversies and rebuild trust within the cryptocurrency market.

In essence, Cleary's investigation into Sullivan and Cromwell's involvement with FT'X is not just about uncovering past conflicts of interest. It's about setting new precedents for legal accountability and ensuring the cryptocurrency industry can evolve into a more transparent and stable sector.",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.1529411764705881,448838375,1,https://btc-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/png-22.png,

The small Baltic nation, known for its digital savvy and e-residency perks, is rolling up its sleeves to get serious about crypto regulation. After sailing through the government, a groundbreaking bill is now waiting in the wings, ready to make its grand entrance in parliament. This bill is a master plan to bring crypto service providers under the watchful eye of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA), which is a major change from the current system where the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) holds the reins. And let me tell you, the stakes are high. The old slap-on-the-wrist fines for messing up? They're about to jump from a mere 40,000 euros to a shocking 5 million euros. You read that right. It is NOT a typo.

Okay so get this. Until now, crypto firms in Estonia could operate with a relatively light touch from the FIU, as long as they played nice and followed Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. But with the new legislation, it is gonna be like moving from the minor leagues to the majors. Starting in 2025, it's the FSA's ballgame, and you know they're not the forgiving type.

But this whole plan is actually about Estonia wanting to align itself with the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, ensuring that it remains a trusted player in the crypto industry. Plus, there's a sweetener for companies looking to raise capital. They're bumping up the threshold for when you need a detailed prospectus from 5 million euros to a more forgiving 8 million euros. This could grease the wheels for startups and established players alike, making it easier to bring in new capital without drowning in paperwork.

You guys remember 2017? Estonia was the crypto darling, rolling out the red carpet for blockchain businesses with its crypto-friendly laws. Fast forward to now, and the tune has changed. After a corruption scandal that actually had nothing to do with crypto, Estonia slammed the brakes on the free-for-all, tightening the screws on regulation. It was their wake-up call, leading to a huge cleanup that saw the number of licensed crypto firms plummet. From a bustling hub with over a thousand crypto companies, the country has seen a dramatic change. Now, only the strongest survive, with roughly 50 firms standing after Estonia's regulatory storm.

The country wants to protect their turf and their reputation. And really, who can blame them? By raising the bar for crypto companies, they're saying, ""Yo, if you want to play in our backyard, you better bring your A-game."" Some people in the crypto industry say it's too much, too fast, while others argue it's exactly what's needed to weed out the bad actors and keep the crypto space clean and credible.

Estonia's Finance Minister, Mart Võrklaev, is the man of the hour, leading the mission with a steady hand. He's confident that the real deal crypto players will rise to the occasion, securing their licenses under the new regime and continuing to innovate within the bounds of the law. It's a balancing act, he says.

Across the pond, India's taking notes but playing a different tune. They're tightening their grip on crypto, pushing major players like OKX to pack up and leave. It's a reminder of the delicate dance countries are doing around crypto regulation, each finding their way through the maze.

So, to the crypto industry, here is my question: Which ones among you are gonna step up to the plate, and which ones will be left behind in Estonia's crypto revolution?",cryptorank.io,news,CryptoRank,,0.07450980392156858,448838324,1,https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png,

Meanwhile, PMI retains tax preferences for conducting business in Ukraine.

In Ukraine, Philip Morris International is officially recognized as an international sponsor of the war - it was included in the relevant list of the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) in 2023 - after the Russian PMI unit reported that the company's net profit in the first year of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine increased to 48.2 billion rubles (45% more than in 2021), and the corporate tax in the Russian budget was paid in the amount of more than $136 million.

Over the past three years, Philip Morris International in Russia has steadily increased its revenue and is in the top 5 foreign companies paying taxes to the Russian budget. In 2021, Philip Morris' revenue was 359.53 billion rubles, in the first 'war' year it increased to 392.9 billion rubles, and in 2023, the company reportedreceiving 399.9 billion rubles.

Despite these indicators, which should have alerted the Ukrainian government seeking new sources of income during the war with Russia, Philip Morris International enjoys a preferential ad valorem tax rate in Ukraine, which does not exist in any other country - 12%.

Ukrainian journalist Denis Bezlyudko drew attention to the paradoxical situation with the use of tax preferences by the international company PMI in Ukraine.

According to the investigator's data, until 2013, the ad valorem tax rate on cigarettes in Ukraine was 25%.

As Ukrainian media reported, in 2013, there was a monopolization by international tobacco companies not only in the sphere of cigarette production, but also in their distribution - Philip Morris International and JTI acquired 20% each inequity interest of the Russian distributor company Megapolis, which owned the Ukrainian subsidiary company-monopolist Megapolis-Ukraine (subsequently, the Ukrainian company was renamed to Tedis).

Parallel to the market monopolization (still under President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government was accused of massive corruption), the ad valorem tax rate was reduced to 12%, providing PMI with additional income.

Paradoxically, the rate remains at this level to this day - against the growing state budget deficit.

""The situation has been cemented. Legislations that could raise this rate are simply not put to the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament - ed.).

In Europe, which we like to compare ourselves to, ad valorem tax rates on cigarettes, for the most part, range from 25% to 50% (in some countries even higher). According to experts' estimates, over 11 years of the reduced rate, the Ukrainian budget lost about 100 billion hryvnias"", - writes Bezlyudko.

Despite the fact that the Ukrainian government, against the backdrop of the cessation of assistance from the United States, is looking for new sources of budget replenishment and cost reduction, the issue of taxation for remaining international companies in Russia is not being discussed in Parliament and society. The same ad valorem tax rate within the price of cigarettes is paid by both those who buy premium products and those who smoke ""Vatra"" (Ukrainian cigarette products in the cheaper price segment).

""In Russia itself, the ad valorem tax rate is 16% [...] In the vast majority of EU countries, ad valorem tax rates are significantly higher and sometimes reach 50%. In other words, a wealthy smoker who smokes expensive premium cigarettes pays more tax than a smoker of cheaper cigarettes.

""And we have equalized taxes on Prima and Marlboro"", - believes the director of the Ukrainian Center for Civil Society Studies, political scientist Vitaly Kulik. - ""The difference is that Prima is of domestic production and does not operate in Russia, while the manufacturer of the Marlboro brand, Philip Morris, still finances the Russian army, killing Ukrainians"".

The Ukrainian expert community proposes, at most, to introduce restrictions for tobacco companies that have not yet left Russia, and at least - to increase the ad valorem tax rate for brands that these companies sell in Ukraine.

The problem of international companies that have remained in the Russian market has also been faced by European countries.

The case of Estonia is interesting.

This is necessary to tie in with agreements made at European level in the Confiscation Directive at the end of 2023 on improving the effectiveness of seizing criminal assets in the European Union. Earlier in the Netherlands, advice was sought from the Council of State on a bill to seize criminal assets. That proposal allowed valuables and assets of criminal origin to be confiscated through civil law proceedings without a suspect's prior conviction. Justice and Security Minister Yeilgz-Zegerius wrote to the House of Representatives today that this bill will be adapted to a criminal law regime, as agreed in the EU directive. By adopting the same criminal procedure within Europe, cooperation with other EU member states can be improved in the seizure of illicit assets.

""Criminal wealth is the lifeblood of organised crime. We are therefore working towards a system-based approach, where seizure without conviction provides a significant acceleration in undermining criminal networks. Thanks to major investigations and the cracking of encrypted communications, we have discovered that many criminals continue to depend on cash, but at the same time we see that a large portion of illegally obtained assets is rapidly channelled internationally to be laundered abroad and invested in new batches of drugs, raw materials for drug production and weapons. Seizure without conviction allows us to move faster. Large sums of cash, properties, luxury cars and other valuable goods can be immediately seized for which suspects cannot indicate a legal origin. As a result, we not only confiscate, but also prevent criminals from using their assets to commit new offences,"" explains Minister Yeilgz.

All EU member states are bound by the obligations of the Confiscation Directive, which has yet to be published. A new bill is being drafted for this purpose in the Netherlands and this will include the proceedings previously known as 'non conviction based confiscation' (NCBC). Under the new bill, this will be an entirely criminal law regime replacing the former NCBC civil law procedure. The details will be discussed with the concerned parties in the criminal justice chain in the coming months. When finalised, the new bill may be submitted for deliberation and then submitted to the Council of State.

Under current legislation, seizure of illicit assets is only possible after a suspect has been convicted of a criminal offence. Under the new bill, property and money can be seized even without a prior conviction if criminal origin can be proven. This increases the effectiveness of confiscating criminal assets. The strength of the new method lies in reversing the current approach: the focus is now not on the person, but on the asset. Moreover, a significant advantage of the criminal procedure is that European cooperation will be facilitated as every EU member state will soon have the same procedure.

The EU is expected to publish the Confiscation Directive before the summer. The aim is to have the new bill ready for consultation as soon as possible thereafter.",europesun.com,news,europesun.com,,0.1450980392156862,448838119,1,https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/europe-sun.jpg,

The move Friday is certain to put more pressure on her party, Spain's main conservative opposition Popular Party, to take action against her.

Ayuso, who is seen as a possible future party leader and prime ministerial candidate, has come under fire in recent months on several fronts. Last week, news reports said the Spanish tax office was investigating accusations of tax fraud against her partner, Alberto González Amador.

His alleged enrichment thanks to his connections with Ayuso has led opposition parties to call for her immediate resignation.

Ayuso, who is visiting Chile on Friday, has hit back, denying the allegations and saying they were part of an orchestrated opposition campaign to try to halt her political rise and take the focus off a major scandal affecting the ruling Socialist party.

Ayuso also claims that while she lives in her partner's luxury Madrid apartment, his financial dealings have nothing to do with her.

The court move Friday against González Amador and four other partners was sparked by a prosecutor's probe into tax fraud of some 350,000 euros ($380,000) following treasury inspections.

Lawyers for González admitted to the fraud this week in a statement to the prosecutors' office, Spanish media reported.

Several hundred people gathered outside the Popular Party's headquarters in Madrid on Wednesday to demand Ayuso's dismissal, the first demonstration against her. The party has so far defended her.

The Socialists and the Popular Party are constantly engaged in accusing each other of corruption and not acting against culprits.

The Socialists are currently grappling with the fallout of a probe into money made from the purchase of masks during the COVID-19 crisis that is affecting an adviser of a former minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and strongman in the Socialist party.

Ayuso, 45, has been regional president since 2019 and won an overwhelming majority in regional elections last year.

Dubbed by some as Spain's future Margaret Thatcher, she has rarely been far from controvers y, both within her party and outside.

She has come under intense criticism for the deaths of more than 7,000 people in nursing homes during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic as orders were issued that they should not be transferred for treatment to overloaded hospitals in the region.

During the crisis, she also attracted much attention at home and abroad by challenging the national government´s lockdown policies.

This week, she defended her chief adviser against accusations that he had bullied journalists deemed to be from opposition media that have been covering the story about her life partner.",washingtontimes.com,news,Washington Times,Ciarán Giles,-0.0117647058823529,448838060,1,https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/03/22/Spain_Madrid_President_87621_c0-271-6484-4051_s1770x1032.jpg?efe965649748d43d15577f4d9cdd7a279744ad98,eng-9418215

The Tar Heels not only clash with a feisty team out of the Big Ten but also battle history, with the Green and White led by legendary coach Tom Izzo, who's known for his mastery of the ""madness"" of March. March Madness odds are showing MSU plenty of respect, with UNC laying just 3.5 points.

The Spartans came out swinging in their opening-round win over Mississippi State, jumping out to a big lead and never taking their foot off the gas en route to a 69-51 win as 1.5-point favorites -- despite being the lower seed.

North Carolina played around with No. 16 Wagner for a bit but dominated an undersized and undermanned Seahawks squad inside, collecting 48 of its total 90 points in the paint. The Tar Heels stepped up big for bettors laying the lumber at -25.5.

I dissect the spread and Over/Under for this ACC vs. Big Ten battle and give my best March Madness picks for Michigan State vs. North Carolina on March 23.

The North Carolina Tar Heels were able to do whatever they wanted against Wagner, including playing the style of offense UNC likes to play.

The Tar Heels are at their best in transition, getting a stop on defense and pushing the pace with the basketball in a more free-flowing attack. They rank Top 75 in points per play in transition and find themselves in the open court at the 26th highest rate in the country.

The Michigan State Spartans are among the better defenses in the land at putting the brakes on transition-heavy teams and will force a more methodical pace, putting UNC into the halfcourt offense more often.

That means more touches for senior big man Armando Bacot in the blocks. He was able to bully the smaller Seahawks frontcourt for easy inside looks and putbacks on offensive rebounds in the Round of 64, finishing with 20 points but could have had a lot more if he wanted to.

Michigan State did get bodied against bigger foes in Big Ten play, watching the likes of Purdue's Zach Edey, Minnesota's Dawson Garcia, and Indiana's Kel'el Ware have high-scoring showings. Offensive rebounds can also be an issue for MSU,

The Spartans caught a break against Mississippi State center Tolu Smith on Thursday, with early foul trouble keeping the Bulldogs' big man on the sideline for much of the first half.

Bacot is playing some of his best -- and consistent -- basketball in the postseason. Before dropping 20 points on Thursday, he put forth scoring efforts of 19, 18, and 14 points (in 25 minutes of a blowout vs. FSU) in three ACC tournament games and is shooting 59% of his last four contests.

The 7-footer has a scoring prop of 13.5 points for this meeting with Michigan State on Saturday, which is pretty much where some player projections have him pegged. That said, given the pace and playsets UNC will be forced into, Bacot has a higher ceiling on the scoresheet.

He's put up 14+ points in four straight games and eight of his last 13 appearances. The Over 13.5 points for Bacot is priced as high as -125 at many sportsbooks, but bet365 is offering that option and a more reasonable -115.

Bacot will see the basketball a lot in a slowed-down tempo and will also be a force on the offensive glass for easy putbacks.

Walker knocked down 3 of 6 from distance against Miss State and projections have him making at least two triples against UNC.

Game models call for a very close contest, but all have North Carolina surviving and advancing to the Sweet 16.

Following UNC's one-sided win over Wagner, books opened the Tar Heels between -2.5 and -3.5 with some sharper online books coming in with a shorter spread. The industry consensus as of Friday afternoon is North Carolina -3.5 with some operators up to -4.

The Tar Heels offense looked much better than its defense in the tournament opener, with UNC getting whatever it wanted down low while also connecting on 9 of 18 shots from beyond the arc.

However, the North Carolina defense wasn't as sharp -- especially considering this team sits among the defensive elite. Wagner, which is a terrible offensive team, went 7-for-18 from deep.

The 3-pointer was also the weapon of choice for Michigan State, which knocked down 10 of 23 attempts from beyond the arc in the squash of Mississippi State on Thursday. The Spartans shot 50% from the floor while checking the Bulldogs to just 52 points on 37% shooting and forcing 14 turnovers.

Saturday's Over/Under total opened as low as 138.5 and has jumped to as high as 140.5 in the first 24 hours of action.

North Carolina is 17-17-1 Over/Under on the season but has played Over the total in four of its last five games overall. The Heels are also 8-2 O/U on neutral courts this season.

Michigan State boasts a 14-20 O/U mark overall and has gone Under in four of its last five games and seven of its last nine. Sparty is 2-4 O/U on neutral site, yet is playing in front of a pro-UNC crowd in Charlotte on Saturday.

North Carolina has won outright on the moneyline in 22 of its last 28 games (+4.95 units).

Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Representative Haley Stevens (D-MI) introduced the PFAS-Free Procurement Act alongside Representatives Mike Lawler (R-NY), Bill Posey (R-FL), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Chris Pappas (D-NH), Katie Porter (D-CA), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA). This bipartisan legislation will prohibit federal agencies from the procurement of items containing certain PFAS, known as the forever chemicals, to better protect workers and American communities. Specifically, this bipartisan legislation prohibits the purchase of products containing perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and prioritizes the procurement of products not containing PFAS.

""The United State Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world, ensuring our procurement policies align with our goals of eliminating forever chemicals is critical,"" said Rep. Stevens. ""The bipartisan, bicameral PFAS-free Procurement Act does just that, by extending the Department of Defense's sensible prohibition on the procurement of PFAS products to most federal government acquisitions we're making a bold step toward eliminating these harmful, forever chemicals from our lives.""

""The PFAS-Free Procurement Act will go a long way to protecting our communities from PFAS chemicals by significantly curtailing the federal use of products containing such chemicals,"" said Rep. Lawler. ""Protecting the health and safety of our citizens is a fundamental duty of governance. I appreciate my colleagues from both parties who have joined me on this important, common sense bill.""

""I have been working tirelessly to protect our Lagoon and Fl-08 families against these forever chemicals. The next step is to prevent further PFAS contamination and stop federal agencies from poisoning our communities,"" said Rep. Posey. ""I am proud to work with Congressman Lawler and others to stop federal PFAS contamination once and for all.""

""Items that contain harmful 'forever chemicals' have no place in federal offices or facilities,"" said Rep. Fitzpatrick. ""As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in introducing the PFAS-Free Procurement Act. Congress must continue to work to reduce the federal purchase and use of products containing these substances.""

""PFAS and other toxic forever chemicals continue to pose health risks to communities in New Hampshire and across the country. We must take comprehensive and commonsense action to better protect the health and wellbeing of Americans,"" said Rep. Pappas. ""This bipartisan legislation would require federal agencies to prioritize procuring PFAS-free products to protect federal employees and individuals, including veterans and seniors, that visit federal facilities. The federal government should be a leader in addressing PFAS contamination, and I'm pleased to join this bipartisan legislation that is an important step forward.""

""All Americans deserve to live long, healthy lives free from dangerous health problems caused by toxic chemicals,"" said Rep. Porter. ""This bipartisan proposal would expand protections for people visiting federal facilities and limit the use of taxpayer dollars to purchase PFAS-contaminated products. As a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, I'll keep working tirelessly with my colleagues to eliminate the use of toxic forever chemicals.""

""PFAS chemicals, even in small amounts, can have harmful impacts on our health and the development of our kids,"" said Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez. ""It's critical that we work to get these forever chemicals out of our communities' water and soil and that we aren't putting more into our environment. Our government has an opportunity to lead by example, so I'm introducing this bipartisan legislation to ensure our significant federal purchasing power isn't used on products containing PFAS.""",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.2627450980392156,448837868,1,,

Kasey Etreni feels it's time for Thunder Bay to look at bumping up the municipal accommodation tax (MAT).

Etreni explained that the tax is charged to visitors that stay in the city.

""Communities such as Kitchener, Ottawa and Toronto have all increased their tax from the original four per cent to anywhere between five and six per cent; in fact, Toronto bumped theirs up to six per cent,"" Etreni explained.

""I believe it is the time to take a look at our MAT and potentially increase it to five per cent.""

The MAT was introduced in 2018 at an established rate of four per cent.

Staff report that the city has received more than $12.3 million in revenue. The annual MAT revenue received is divided equally between the city and the Community Economic Development Commission.

""I know people were very concerned that when MAT became included on your accommodation bills that we would lose tourism,"" Etreni added.

""Travellers do definitely pay attention to their bill and save money where they can, but I believe people are quite accustomed and used to the tax by now.

""Tourism has a huge economic value on our community and I don't see raising the MAT by one per cent as doing harm to that but actually bringing more money into our community.""

The views expressed in IMF Working Papers are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF, its Executive Board, or IMF management.

Pillar Two rules of the Inclusive Framework agreement on a minimum corporate tax (known as 'Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules', for short GloBE) have important implications for the design of the corporate income tax. This chapter discusses these implications particularly from the perspective of low-tax jurisdictions. It argues that it is not possible to design a system that always guarantees generating exactly the bare minimum tax intended by the rules and motivates that this should not be the policy objective anyway. Importantly, if no profit tax already exists, countries need to consider whether to adopt one, and if yes, in what form. There is a case for introducing a general profit tax beyond the GloBE rules, together with a qualifying GloBE domestic minimum top-up tax as a backstop. The familiar alternatives of efficient economic rent tax designs, however, are no longer equivalent under the GloBE. In practice, given the specifics of the rules, an efficient rent tax on in-scope multinationals cannot be combined with a statutory tax rate below a certain cutoff, because the minimum tax becomes always binding. Under the GloBE, immediate expensing particularly maintains the time-value of fully deducting the cost of investment, without impacting the GloBE effective tax rate.",imf.org,news,International Monetary Fund (IMF),,0.2392156862745098,448837717,1,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/News/twitter-seal.ashx,eng-9411982

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, and J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, introduced Thursday the , a bill that aims to end tax-free mergers and taxpayer subsidies for acquisitions that consolidate corporate power. Whitehouse is generally considered liberal and Vance a staunch conservative, and their co-sponsorship points to a growing backlash on both sides of the aisle in Congress to corporate concentration.

The Biden administration too has been ramping up its antitrust efforts, most recently with a lawsuit filed on Thursday against Apple by the Justice Department. The lawmakers pointed to megamergers in the past decade such as Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014, and AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, for which the companies received tax benefits. In 2022, AT&T spun off Warner Media, which then merged with Discovery in a $43 billion deal that will also be tax-free, as well as Canadian Pacific Railway's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern and Capital One's $35 billion acquisition of Discover.

""Record numbers of giant corporate mergers have created an anti-competitive economic landscape,"" Whitehouse said in a statement. ""The families who get stuck paying higher prices as a result of these mega-mergers should not also have to foot the tax bill for them. Our bipartisan bill will end a massive tax giveaway for giant corporate mergers and get our government out of the business of subsidizing corporate consolidation.""

When one corporation is sold to or merges with another, the acquiring firm usually pays tax on the appreciated gain of stocks and/or assets held by the target firm. However, the Tax Code contains a significant exception for certain types of mergers: if a corporate reorganization is structured so the acquiring firm is exchanging stock, then the appreciation in value of the target firm's stock and/or assets can be fully tax exempt. That means neither the corporation nor its shareholders may owe tax on the appreciation in value at the time of sale.

While the tax is deferred rather than forgiven, in practice the corporation and its shareholders can escape paying taxes on the appreciated stock forever. The Stop Subsidizing Giant Mergers Act would end this tax-free treatment for corporate mergers and acquisitions involving firms with combined average annual gross receipts exceeding $500 million during the prior three years. The legislation makes exceptions for mergers involving a small business, and corporations that are undergoing a purely internal reorganization would still be able to do so without incurring a tax obligation.

""Massive corporate mergers rarely produce their promised benefits but often leave American workers and families behind,"" Vance said in a statement. ""It's past time to close the unfair loopholes that allow these deals to escape tax liability.

President Barack Obama is considering using prosecutorial discretion to effectively legalize millions of illegal immigrants. Doing so would be unjust and costly and would encourage more illegal immigration.[1] Congress should discourage the Administration from considering this divisive and unproductive step, which would only make it more difficult to implement suitable, feasible, and just immigration reforms and more robust and effective border security.

Background

Current U.S. law, written and passed by Congress and signed by the President, makes it unlawful for foreign nationals to enter or stay in the country without authorization.[2] Despite this clear provision of law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimated that about 11.4 million people lived in the United States without authorization in January 2012.[3] Deportations, particularly interior enforcement, have decreased dramatically under President Obama,[4] and he has made clear his support for granting legal status to those who are in the country unlawfully.[5]

The Department of Homeland Security issued the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) memorandum on June 15, 2012. DACA purported to set prosecutorial priorities and grant relief to each individual who (1) came to the U.S. under the age of 16; (2) continuously resided in the U.S. for at least five years before the date of the memo; (3) is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has a GED, or is an honorably discharged veteran; (4) has not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or multiple misdemeanors or otherwise poses a threat; and (5) is not above the age of 30.[6]

In early 2013, debate began on a comprehensive immigration bill that would include an amnesty for most of the unlawful immigrant population. The U.S. Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) in June 2013.[7] In January 2014, the leadership of the House of Representatives issued ""principles"" for immigration reform[8] that included a general legalization much like S. 744.[9]

Since the issuance of the DACA memo and during debate over a larger amnesty, the number of people unlawfully crossing the U.S. border has increased significantly.[10] Many are turning themselves in, believing that they could qualify for deferred action even though the memorandum requires continuous residence since at least June 15, 2007.[11] Even if they do not qualify for DACA, lax enforcement in general means that most illegal immigrants will not be deported once they enter the interior of the U.S.[12] President Obama and some in Congress sought to advance a comprehensive bill, but momentum for such a measure has collapsed, in part as a result of the massive influx of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border of the United States.

Leaders in Congress have called for greater enforcement of the law, while President Obama continues to call for legalization. Recent press reports indicate that he is inclined to issue a memo like DACA for a large subset of the illegal immigrant population, perhaps up to 5 million.[13] That would be a mistake for three primary reasons: It is unjust, it is costly, and it will not work to stop illegal immigration. Before addressing these concerns, it is important to consider why we have immigration laws.

Why Do We Have Immigration Laws?

America has always welcomed immigrants. In fact, the Declaration of Independence took note of King George III's abuse in the form of ""obstructing the laws for Naturalization of Foreigners [and] refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither."" Immigration can help a nation economically and socially, as it has the United States. As President Ronald Reagan said:

The magnet that draws [immigrants] is freedom and the beacon that guides them is hope. America offers liberty for all, encourages hope for betterment, and nurtures great expectations. In this free land a person can realize his dreams -- going as far as talent and drive can carry him. In return America asks each of us to do our best, to work hard, to respect the law, to cherish human rights, and to strive for the common good.[14]

A sovereign country is fully entitled and wise to determine who can and cannot enter or stay in the country. Open borders are particularly unwise because of the threat of global terrorism.[15] There are reports that recent illegal migrants across the U.S. southern border have included individuals from countries on the terrorist watch list, such as Yemen.[16]

Unlimited immigration is also a concern in a constitutional republic like the United States that is ultimately governed by the people. America's newest arrivals, particularly those who become citizens, must be instructed in our democratic customs, which make America an exceptional nation. Of particular importance are the rule of law, private property rights, freedom from corruption, free markets, tolerance, and equality under the law. In other words, immigration should be at a pace to allow beneficial assimilation.[17] No matter what one believes about the level of immigration, it should be a matter of debate among the people and decided by our elected representatives.

The level of legal immigration is a topic of worthy debate. One recent Reuters poll finds that only 16 percent of Americans want increased immigration.[20] In any event, the level of immigration should be determined democratically through our elected representatives, particularly Congress, which has authority to ""establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.""[21] The President disregarded the separation of powers in the DHS's inappropriate DACA memorandum, and any further legalization would raise even more serious concerns.[22] It is unjust for the President to override the people's determination (expressed through Congress) of how many people are welcome as residents of the United States.

President Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Born in other countries, yet believing you could be happy in this, our laws acknowledge, as they should do, your right to join us in society, conforming...to our established rules.""[23] Such positive support for legal immigration -- including insistence that it be done through proper channels -- has been the hallmark of our nation's immigration policy.

A just government applies the law equally as much as is possible, with special exceptions made only rarely and for extraordinary circumstances. Presidential nullification of our immigration laws for entire classes of people -- for millions of people who deliberately violated our laws -- is unjust. It involves arbitrary and unequal application of congressionally enacted immigration law. By so doing, it fundamentally runs counter to the rule of law, which lies at the core of our constitutional republic.

Such presidential nullification of established immigration law is unjust to those who decided not to come to the United States because they would be doing so without authorization. Millions of people would fit into this category in Mexico alone.[24] Granting amnesty for another class of people who violated our laws treats those who respect our laws with contempt.

It is also unjust to the millions of Americans and resident legal immigrants who followed the rules. Many had to follow our sometimes lengthy process as relatives or spouses of those here legally. Others simply wanted to come to study or work in the United States and followed the rules to do so legally. Granting blanket amnesty to those who neglected to follow our law is a slap in the face to those who are following the rules.

Moreover, it is more difficult to apprehend dangerous criminals at the border if the Border Patrol has to deal with an increasing number of illegal immigrants crossing the border. That will increase the cost and/or decrease the effectiveness of protecting the American people -- an unjust result.

Refusing to uphold the law equally by making special exceptions for favored groups fits the pattern of unfairness emanating from Washington. Citizens and lawful residents in the states (especially border states) bear the brunt of the irresponsible federal abdication of immigration law, while those who are favored by Washington reap windfalls not due to them under the law and normal democratic process.

Administrative Amnesty Is Costly

S. 744 would have legalized unlawful immigrants if they met certain conditions, such as continuous residence in the United States for a period of time and undergoing background checks. Such policies, however, wrongly presume that the DHS has the capability to process additional cases. For example, when DACA was implemented, background checks were supposed to be run on each applicant. The DHS, however, abandoned rigorous checks and opted for minimal, ""lean and lite"" background checks as it was overwhelmed by applications or simply decided to ignore such requirements.[25] Furthermore, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has struggled to replace its existing paper-based application system with a web-based one, and S. 744 would make the system worse by requiring the DHS to accept paper-based application for years to come.[26]

Given the government's past difficulties with immigration enrollment programs and an existing backlog of at least 4.3 million people waiting for green cards, an administrative amnesty of up to 5 million individuals would have significant costs and cause major difficulties.[27] At least some of the costs could be offset with fees (DACA imposed a fee of nearly $400).

An amnesty-today policy would encourage more illegal immigrants to come in hopes of a future amnesty. The cost of the policy is therefore larger than just the administrative cost. From an economic theory standpoint, illegal immigration may seem beneficial because labor is being used more productively, but many costs are associated with unlawful immigrants. As Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman put it, free immigration to jobs is one thing, but free immigration to welfare is quite another.[28] Illegal immigrants who reside in the United States pay some taxes but consume more in government benefits, such as education.[29]

An amnesty policy will be costly to taxpayers at the local, state, and federal levels. An administrative amnesty would be the latest example of Washington benefiting some (illegal immigrants) at the cost of others (lawful residents).

Administrative Amnesty Won't Work

Just as talk of amnesty and the issuance of DACA encouraged more border crossings, an expanded administrative amnesty will encourage even more unlawful immigration in the years ahead. In 1986, Congress passed and the President signed a general amnesty of an estimated 3 million unlawful immigrants. Today, more than 11 million unlawful immigrants reside in the United States. Sponsors of the legislation promised that the amnesty would be ""a one-time only"" measure[30] and was being done in exchange for a secure border and interior enforcement measures. Yet nearly three decades later, the promised enforcement and border security are lackluster, and amnesty is being pursued again.

If President Obama pursues an administrative amnesty of millions of people, potential future illegal immigrants might think (wrongly) that they could qualify under this grant of amnesty or (rightly) that another amnesty is likely in the future if they can avoid deportation in the meantime. The end result will be more illegal immigrants crossing our borders.

What the U.S. Should Do

The President should not pursue an unpopular, polarizing administrative amnesty that is unfair, is costly, and will encourage more illegal immigration. If the President does pursue administrative amnesty, Congress should consider:

The latest form of copium for fans of Ubisoft's first-person shooter à la classic Call of Duty games has come in the form of a leak that may or may not point to the game coming out on the same day that doubles as a last chance for Americans to file their income taxes.

A Ubisoft leaker by the name of Frax has found that XDefiant Founder's Pack DLC are ""set to be enabled"" on April 15, which perhaps opens the door for the game to release on that day, or, at the very least, that week.

XDefiant was pretty fun when it was available, but it's been a long, tumultuous time since the game's beta ended. Since then, the title has been delayed multiple times out of supposed release windows, including ""late summer"" 2023 and then again in the winter, thanks to a variety of issues.

Some have gotten so desperate and excited that they have even formed an esports roster for the game without it even having an official release date, and with the last time anyone got a chance to play it being nine months ago.

Continuing development issues and delays aside, XDefiant has a devoted fanbase who are looking forward to its release, whenever it may be. They are led on by hope each time something leaks or when the development team even mentions its existence. And with recent teases, including a new Rainbow Six-themed faction, there's reason to get hyped. But for now, the release window remains unofficial.

Touted as one of the country's clean energy and climate mitigating projects, Metro Global Holdings Corporation is securing national, environmental, and power generation clearances so it could begin putting up the 15-megawatt plant on a 6-hectare private lot in Benguet province's Sablan town, said Robert John Sobrepeña, the company chair, at a press briefing.

Although numerous WTE projects are currently being developed in the country, Metro Global's power plant could be the first to operate if plans are not disrupted, he said.

The proposed power plant will run on refuse-derived fuel (RDF). RDF (also known as biomass) is produced from nonhazardous trash collected from households, commercial establishments, and construction and demolition projects.

The WTE plant or power island ""uses steam or heat -- and is not an incinerator -- to turn the turbines that generate the power,"" said Rafael Perez de Tagle, Metro Global executive vice president for operations and a member of its board of directors.

A prototype of the facility, meanwhile, will be constructed simultaneously to convert Sablan's municipal solid waste into RDF pellets as ""proof of concept'"" for the town and as part of its municipal waste management plan, which Metro Global is helping draft, he said.

""We are putting up a pilot (WTE system) that will fetch the municipal waste in Sablan, bring it to the pilot site, and create the RDF pellets that would be needed by the [main power plant]. This is the first thing we are doing in Sablan,"" Sobrepeña said.

Unsolicited proposal

He noted that RDF can be stockpiled and hauled to the main power plant once it becomes operational.

Metro Global first pitched the WTE project as an unsolicited proposal for Baguio's Public Private Partnership Program. It was later presented in 2021 to the mayors of Blistt- an economic collaboration between Baguio and the Benguet towns of La Trinidad, Itogon, Tuba, and Tublay, which has evolved into a metropolis governed by the Blistt Metropolitan Development Authority (as prescribed by Republic Act No. 11932).

Sobrepeña said Baguio City, through Mayor Benjamin Magalong, has been offered to buy the Sablan property hosting the plant, which would make the city a joint venture investor. The Sablan government was also asked to consider partnering with Baguio, he said.

The city had signed a feedstock agreement with Metro Global, which guarantees that it would take all of Baguio's solid waste to fuel the power plant.

Saving on costs

Sobrepeña said it would spare the city from spending almost P200 million annually to haul 140 tons of daily residual trash to a commercial landfill in Tarlac and Pangasinan provinces.

The feedstock agreement drew some reservations from the city council when it was presented in November last year.

Councilor Peter Fianza, a former city administrator, said it runs counter to the city's solid waste management plan, which aspires to reduce household trash and promotes recycling and other practices that would theoretically eliminate residential waste in the near future.

Each Baguio resident, transient, or tourist generates 1.5 kilos of garbage in a day, according to a 2016 city waste profile.

READ: Betting on money-for-waste business model

Sobrepeña acknowledged that Metro Global would import waste from the other Blistt towns and purchase waste from other communities outside to sustain the required 500 tons of trash needed to create electricity each day.

The Metro Global WTE plant will supply power to a 4.7-kilometer elevated monorail which the company also intends to build for Baguio.

The electric train would circle downtown Baguio and connect to Camp John Hay.",newsinfo.inquirer.net,news,Inquirer.net,Vincent Cabreza,0.1764705882352942,448837406,1,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2024/03/675011.jpeg,

ATLANTA -- Democratic state Rep. Omari Crawford seemed like a deer in headlights when his suicide-prevention measure was swiftly rewritten by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Senate Republicans to become a grab bag of culture war measures.

""It's quite a bit,"" Republican state Sen. Clint Dixon quipped this week, describing an overhaul destined to draw national headlines and stir heated debate.

To Democratic state Sen. Sonya Halpern, the overhaul was no laughing matter -- an emblem, she said, of how ""contentious kinds of conversations"" were increasingly emerging in the GOP-run Senate.

Time and again this session, Jones and his Senate allies have been the engines behind provocative legislation designed to gin up conservative votes in the May primaries and November general election.

As the legislative session nears its end, the Republican-controlled Senate has pingponged between seemingly minor debates over MAGA-inspired license plates to broader culture war feuds that revive decades-old fights.

And Jones has embraced his chamber's role even if it means picking fights with Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns or irritating Gov. Brian Kemp, who has taken an arm's-length approach to most legislative debates.

Jones' agenda this session, too, could serve as a blueprint of a potential campaign to succeed Kemp in Georgia's top job.

Senate Republicans muscled through religious freedom legislation that has spurred debate for decades despite deep concerns from an alliance of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Metro Atlanta Chamber.

Jones and his deputies launched inquiries into the election policies of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after he refused then-President Donald Trump's call to ""find"" him enough votes to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia.

They also created a panel to investigate Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after she brought charges of election interference against Trump and some of his Republican allies.

While both chambers have pursued bipartisan measures to incentivize the purchase of gun safes, Senate Republicans also pushed a five-day sales tax holiday on guns and ammunition to coincide with the start of deer-hunting season.

And Senate leaders took a surprisingly confrontational stance against an effort by Burns to increase the state standard homestead exemption.

""I think we can do more than this,"" Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome, said before his panel dramatically increased the homestead exemption hike that Burns was touting.

To Democrats, these stances are a sign that the 2026 campaigns for statewide offices have already arrived.

""You have lots of folks who are eyeing higher office in our chamber, so they are forced to the right in anticipation of competitive primaries that have gotten even more extreme,"" said state Sen. Jason Esteves, D-Atlanta.

""It's unfortunate,"" he said, ""because issues important to everyday Georgians get placed on the back burner as a result of it.""

State Sen. Jason Anavitarte, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, shrugged off the criticism.

""We are just talking about the issues that average Georgians want: A better economy, personal rights and more freedom,"" he said.

Burt's blessing

It's not unusual for Senate-House relations to grow tense and even toxic in the final days of the legislative session.

Nor is it out of the ordinary for the Senate to push more conservative legislation than the House, which in recent years has tempered some of the most controversial legislation coming from across the hall.

But the range of culture war legislation emanating from the Senate this year stands out, along with ever-present reminders that Jones is working to curry favor with Georgia's formidable MAGA base.

A devoted Trump ally, Jones has not been shy about his embrace of the former president's brand of politics.

He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he gave his blessing to a range of efforts designed to punish Willis for bringing the election-interference trial against Trump. Jones, who served as a Trump elector, could face charges in the probe.

And since taking office last year, Jones has seemed to relish stoking debates. He let a doomed Buckhead cityhood measure reach a Senate vote despite Kemp's opposition.

He proposed a state-funded stipend to encourage teachers to carry guns in classrooms, and included $5 million in his latest budget proposal that could help finance the program if local officials approve.

And the Senate has pushed legislation to eliminate automatic voter registration, drawing a veto threat from Kemp, who implemented the policy in 2016 when he was secretary of state.

'Lack of respect'

Not everything Jones has done has ignited GOP activists. Mack Parnell of the Georgia Faith and Freedom Coalition praised Jones for ""courageously leading the way for religious freedom"" and a host of other measures but dinged him for his out-front support of sports betting.

""While disagreement remains over the push for the expansion of predatory gambling,"" Parnell said, ""we appreciate the Senate's willingness to pass bold and commonsense legislation for Georgia families.""

This week, the focus on socially conservative legislation ratcheted up when Senate lawmakers melded together a trio of controversial proposals that stalled earlier this year. One would ban transgender athletes from playing sports, another would prevent sex education in schools before the sixth grade.

Outraged Democrats quickly pushed back, leading to an extraordinary exchange over the sex education rules between Democratic state Sen. Elena Parent and Dixon, who chairs the Senate Education and Youth Committee.

""How are the schools supposed to talk about menstruation without talking about human reproduction, which is forbidden before sixth grade?"" Parent asked.

""I am not a woman, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express,"" Dixon quipped. ""But I would say to the reproductive part of it, or whatnot, I don't think that would align with sex education.""

Parent pressed further: ""So you think you can talk to a girl about menstruation without touching on any aspect of human reproduction?""

""That's a great question,"" Dixon responded. ""I've got two daughters. One is currently going through puberty, and my wife and I have been able to successfully -- with her guidance and her leadership, my wife's leadership -- have had those conversations with her without talking about reproduction.""

On Wednesday, as Parent waded through an evening of committee votes involving more last-minute changes to weighty policy bills, she had one takeaway.

""This just shows so much lack of respect for the voters,"" she said.

Slamming the House

The Senate isn't only fighting the rest of the Capitol on culture war issues.

Two weeks ago the Senate Finance Committee took up one of Burns' top priorities: raising the state homestead exemption on property from $2,000 to $4,000. The higher the exemption, the lower a homeowner's property taxes.

But the committee called out House Bill 1019 as a weak attempt to address the problem of skyrocketing property values, which are leading to big tax bills. Senators said the increase would only affect homeowners in one-third of the state's counties because the rest already have higher exemptions. And in counties that have $2,000 exemptions now, homeowners would only see a $20-$30 tax break.

Senate Appropriations Chairman Blake Tillery, R-Vidalia, said, ""I am concerned if we pass this, that this becomes the bill that everybody says, 'Hey, we did something.' ""

House officials were not amused at the treatment of Burns' bill, which didn't get a vote.

Then, a week later, the committee increased the exemption in the bill to $10,000 without an accounting of how much it will cost cities, counties and school districts in terms of lost revenue.

""I would say there have been some astounding moves in the Senate with big policy implications,"" said Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, a member of the committee. ""It's safe to say the gloves are off and there are a lot of egregious things being said and done down here.""

House Majority Whip James Burchett, R-Waycross, puts the difference between the House and Senate in part down to the size of their constituencies.

""We have members that represent smaller districts and are a little bit closer to the people,"" Burchett said. ""We are talking to folks every day and taking up issues they are telling us they need help on.""

But Rep. David Wilkerson, D-Powder Springs, said there's more to it than that. He called the GOP majority in the Senate ""more Trumpy"" than ever.

""What we got back from the Senate seems to be a lot more social type issues, and even when they are on education, there seems to be a hidden agenda,"" he said.

""The Senate has always had its challenges, but they had people there to moderate things,"" Wilkerson added. ""I think they're losing that and you're getting more Colton Moores.""

Moore, an ultraconservative Republican, has been kicked out of his own caucus in the Senate and was banned from the House floor last week for making disparaging remarks in the Senate about the late David Ralston on the same day the former Republican speaker's portrait was unveiled in the House.

""A lot of games are getting played at the end. We definitely have to pay attention,"" Wilkerson said. ""The Senate's gonna Senate.""

The no. 9 Wildcats took on the no. 8 Owls in the first round of the men's basketball tournament Friday. Trailing 58-56 with just eight seconds left in the half, Northwestern guard Brooks Barnhizer made a layup to tie then game.

On the ensuing possession, Florida Atlantic guard Johnell Davis slowly dribbled the ball before attempting a heavily contested 3-pointer. He air-balled the shot to send the game to overtime.

""What's he doing?"" Raftery said as Davis rose to attempt the game winner. ""Why would he stop? Blow by and get to the rim! You're gonna get a good shot or find somebody!""

One Twitter user theorized that Davis thought there was more time. Considering his apparent lack of urgency, it seems to be a reasonable assumption.

Unfortunately for Davis and the rest of Florida Atlantic, that wasted opportunity would come back to haunt them.

Google is still ""evaluating the potential"" for a data center complex in the Cedar Rapids area, a spokesperson said Friday after the state signed off on $56 million in incentives for the project.

The Iowa Economic Development Authority board approved the tax abatements for the $576 million project, which has the potential to be the city's largest on record, and revealed that Google was the previously unnamed company behind it. Cedar Rapids approved a development agreement with the then-unnamed entity last month, the Gazette reported, for the construction of one or more data centers on the city's far north side near the Eastern Iowa Airport.

But in an email to the Des Moines Register on Friday, a Google spokesperson said plans have yet to be finalized.

""We are always planning for future capacity needs,"" it said. ""These are complex projects and development of the site is subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to competitive energy rates along with a sustainable and sufficient energy supply.""

The project would create 31 jobs paying at least $31.44 per hour. The IEDA granted Cedar Rapids the ability to leverage the High Quality Jobs program -- which provides tax credits and refunds to businesses that move to or expand in Iowa -- to give Google a break on property taxes that would otherwise increase with the completed data center's assessed value.

The company's exemption would last for a period of 20 years, an IEDA report said. The state has yet to dole out any funds for the center.

If Google does proceed, construction could begin this summer, with hiring expected to take place in 2025. The center would be fully functional by 2026.

""We're very excited about the project today, but also for what has occurred and what will occur in Cedar Rapids over the coming years,"" City Manager Jeff Pomeranz told the IEDA board. ""We're really, from an economic development perspective, (going) in a very, very positive direction.""

Google's Iowa investments could balloon to over $6 billion

Google first came to Iowa in 2007 with a multimillion-dollar data center in Council Bluffs. In 2022, the company invested another $600 million in its already $5 billion, 1,000-acre complex, bringing its total workforce to 281.

Microsoft and Meta have joined it in Iowa, building data centers in locations including Altoona and West Des Moines. Apple began preparing for construction of a 400,000-square-foot data center in Waukee in 2021.

Factors that make the state attractive to tech companies include an abundance of inexpensive, environmentally friendly wind energy, access to high-speed fiber optic connections and tax incentives.

The IEDA noted that Google's infrastructure requirements have increased as its customer base and demand for services have grown. The company announced earlier in March that it would be investing $1 billion in a new data center in Kansas City, Missouri, with Google executive Monique Picou saying it will play an essential role in supporting the company's artificials intelligence innovations.",desmoinesregister.com,news,Des Moines Register,,0.2470588235294118,448837098,1,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d3d774794dad13ae5a0b8219b04128ea737e7ab/c=148-0-1805-932/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/04/16/B9317006201Z.1_20150416161922_000_G3IAH9K9V.1-0.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200,eng-9416312

In New York, the price of uranium futures has dipped to $88.50 per pound, a decrease from the peak seen in February, which was a 16-year high, yet remains significantly above the average price of $66.60 recorded last year.

Jonathan Hinze, president of UxC, a nuclear industry research firm told the news outlet: ""We have reached a bottom. The fundamentals are still strong, with increased demand and supply that hasn't fully responded.""

According to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Kozak, there's evidence to suggest that uranium prices have stabilized. Kozak forecasts a resurgence of fundamental buyers in the market, which is expected to propel prices upwards once more, Bloomberg wrote this week.

Optimistic investors are focusing on uranium's future, driven by an increasing supply shortage and higher demand, as nations (finally pull their heads out from their a** and) seek nuclear energy solutions for climate change.

This interest is highlighted amid supply warnings from Canada's Cameco and Kazakhstan's Kazatomprom, the leading producers responsible for half of the worldwide uranium supply. Kazatomprom forecasts a significant supply deficit escalating from 21 million pounds in 2030 to 147 million pounds by 2040.

Geopolitical tensions, including a U.S. proposal to ban Russian uranium imports, which are essential for nuclear power and weapons, add complexity to the supply scenario, the report says. However, the potential resurgence of dormant mining operations due to rising uranium prices poses a risk of dampening the market rally, reminiscent of the recent boom-to-bust cycle in battery metals.

""We have a number of geopolitical factors that have a really significant influence on buyer behavior, even though fundamentally nothing has changed. Buyers can use the spot to tell them the sentiment of the day, but must look at the long-term market to see that it is marching steadily up, it hasn't taken a hiccup at all,"" concluded Treva Klingbiel, president of uranium price provider TradeTech.",therussophile.org,news,TheRussophiles,Tyler Durden,0.2784313725490195,448837057,1,https://i0.wp.com/therussophile.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ura.jpg?fit=500%2C281&ssl=1,

This comes in the midst of an intricate legal issue involving extradition requests from South Korea, where Kwon is wanted in connection to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which caused huge financial losses estimated at around $40 billion in 2022.

As per Coingape's earlier report, the Montenegrin Supreme Court has, however, postponed the extradition process of Kwon due to procedural mistakes and the overstepping of jurisdiction by the lower courts, hence postponing Kwon's transfer to South Korea.

Following the Supreme Court's ruling, Do Kwon is scheduled to be released from the Spuz prison tomorrow and placed under house arrest. This choice involves strict terms that include confiscation of Kwon's travel documents so that he cannot move outside Montenegro's borders.

Courts in Podgorica have ordered that the seizure of Kwon's passport, as an assurance of security, will actually prohibit him from leaving the country. This measure is designed to secure Kwon's presence at ongoing legal proceedings but to do so in a way that respects what's left of his freedom, considering the severity of the allegations.

The intervention of the Montenegrin Supreme Court revealed procedural inadequacies in the extradition procedure of Do Kwon. The council highlighted that the lower courts, by proceeding with a ""shortened procedure"" for extradition despite the presence of two separate applications, had overstepped their boundaries.

This overstep essentially infringed upon the usual jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice, which led the Supreme Court to stay the extradition until more review could take place.

Consequently, extradition suspension allows for additional legal consideration and analysis to be given, which ensures that any decision concerning Kwon's future will be made in accordance with the principles of legality and justice. This phase will probably involve a comprehensive assessment of all the legal arguments and evidence submitted by the parties with a view to arriving at a resolution that is in accordance with national and international legal norms.

During the event ""Fueling Economic Growth through Increased Tobacco Taxation"" organized by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC), activists urged the Government of Pakistan to transition to a Single Tier Tobacco Taxation System, thereby eliminating the second tier. This strategic move is deemed essential not only for boosting revenue but also for relieving the healthcare cost burdens imposed by tobacco-related illnesses.

Malik Imran Ahmed, Country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids (CTFK), highlighted the alignment between the IMF's recommendations and the ongoing discussions with Pakistan. These discussions aim to tackle the nation's fiscal and external sustainability weaknesses while fostering economic recovery and inclusive growth. A key component involves strengthening public finances through gradual fiscal consolidation, broadening the tax base in undertaxed sectors, and improving tax administration to enhance debt sustainability. Imran emphasized the urgent need to tie these objectives with tobacco taxation, stressing the imperative of reforming Pakistan's cigarette taxation system.

Malik Imran further emphasized that revitalizing Pakistan's cigarette taxation system transcends mere fiscal considerations; it is a matter of urgent public health concern. He lamented that despite the substantial taxes imposed on cigarettes, the revenue generated falls short of covering the healthcare costs incurred due to smoking-related illnesses. In the fiscal year 2022-23, taxes covered a meager 16% of these expenses, indicating a significant decline from 19.5% in 2019.

Dr. Khalil Ahmad Dogar, Program Manager at SPARC, underscored the alarming prevalence of tobacco use in Pakistan. With approximately 31.9 million adults aged 15 years and above reported as current tobacco users, constituting nearly 19.7% of the adult population, the dire consequences of tobacco consumption extend far beyond individual health.

He stressed the urgent need for immediate action to bridge the gap between tobacco tax revenue and healthcare costs. He advocated for the adoption of a Single Tier Tobacco Taxation System, as recommended by the IMF, as a means to not only bolster revenue but also to alleviate the health and economic burdens associated with tobacco consumption.",dailytimes.com.pk,news,Daily Times,Sajid Salamat,0.2392156862745098,448836922,1,https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-220124.jpg,eng-9419647

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",brushnewstribune.com,news,Brush News-Tribune,,0.05882352941176472,448836454,1,https://www.brushnewstribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

House Bill 0148 - Regulation of Abortions would require clinics performing surgical abortions in the state to be licensed as ""ambulatory surgical centers,"" and would require patients seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound beforehand.

While two abortion bans are being debated in the state's court system, Gordon said he felt this bill would ""further delay"" a definitive ruling on the statewide constitutionality of abortion.

""With the judge certifying these cases to the Wyoming Supreme Court, the state is closer than ever to a decision on the constitutionality of abortion in Wyoming,"" Gordon said in a statement. ""It is my opinion that HB148, as amended, had the potential to further delay the resolution of this critical issue for the unborn. The potential of starting over on a new course of legal arguments would in my mind be derelict, and would have only sacrificed additional unborn lives in Wyoming.""

In his explanatory letter, Gordon noted that his disagreement with the bill was focused on the amendments made to it over the course of this year's legislative session, not a disapproval of its original intent.

In a scathing critique of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, one of the world's largest venture capital firms, has launched a blistering attack on the agency's handling of crypto regulation. The lawyer targeted the SEC's crypto enforcement division, labeling its lawyers ""incompetent"" and ""complicit in the ongoing abuses of power.""

DebtBox case fallout and mounting pressure

Jennings' criticism comes in the wake of the SEC's failed lawsuit against DebtBox, a blockchain firm accused of fraud leading to a loss of over $49 million for investors. The regulator alleged that DebtBox had falsely marketed node licenses for cryptocurrency mining to investors, ultimately leading to no mining activities.

However, DebtBox emerged victorious in the legal battle, with the judge siding with the blockchain firm and accusing the SEC of presenting ""misleading statements and abusing power."" This ruling has intensified pressure on the agency, particularly from critics within the crypto and blockchain sector, who endorse the court's verdict and accuse the SEC of abusing its authority.

In his post on X, Jennings criticized the SEC's pursuit of DebtBox as a ""symptom of hyper politicization,"" eroding trust in the agency's enforcement division. Consequently, he announced that a16z Crypto would no longer engage with law firms hiring former SEC crypto enforcement lawyers, deeming it necessary to combat the alleged issues within the regulatory body. However, the venture capital firm has not officially endorsed Jennings' statement.

The post has sparked controversy, with commentators divided in their opinions. While some supported Jennings' stance, others argued that blacklisting law firms hiring from the enforcement division could be seen as punitive. Amid the storm, some have come forward to defend the professionalism and ethics of certain SEC lawyers, acknowledging the presence of ""bad faith"" actors in any organization.

Response from the SEC and future implications

The response from the SEC to the mounting criticism remains uncertain, particularly from the crypto community. As laws are drafted and policy evolves in crypto, the commission will likely face increasing scrutiny. Additionally, all eyes are on the SEC regarding its ruling on multiple spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

In a recent post on X, Paul Grewal, General Counsel for Coinbase, stated that the agency has ""no reason to decline applications made for the product."" This further underscores the anticipation surrounding the SEC's stance on crypto-related financial instruments.

As the debate over crypto regulation intensifies, Miles Jennings' critique of the SEC has ignited a heated discussion within the industry. With the fallout from the DebtBox case and mounting pressure on the regulatory body, the future trajectory of crypto regulation in the United States remains uncertain. The SEC's response to criticism, coupled with its decisions on forthcoming regulatory matters, will undoubtedly shape the landscape of the crypto market in the coming months.",cryptopolitan.com,news,Cryptopolitan,Ibrahim Abdulaziz,-0.388235294117647,448836200,1,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Default_SEC_over_crypto_regulation_1.jpg,eng-9408769

(AP) -- The Tennessee Senate on Thursday approved a nearly $2 billion tax and refund for businesses, a proposal designed to prevent threats of a potential lawsuit even as critics warned the so-called solution was rushed without being properly vetted and shrouded in mystery.

Starting last fall, Republican legislative leaders say a law firm representing a large group of businesses contacted the state to question the legality of Tennessee's 90-year-old franchise tax and demanded a refund. In response, Gov. Bill Lee initially proposed offering businesses $1.2 billion in refunds and then an ongoing $410 million in tax breaks.

That amount has since been tweaked in the Senate to $1.56 billion in refunds and $393 million in tax breaks, totaling $1.95 billion.

""This bill will put this issue behind us and address it in a responsible way,"" said Republican Sen. Ken Yager, adding that doing so could make the state more competitive in attracting businesses to move to Tennessee.

At issue are concerns that the state's franchise tax violates a U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause provision, which bans states from passing laws that burden interstate commerce. Further adding to the legal woes is a 2015 case involving the U.S. Supreme Court striking down down Maryland's tax that the justices ruled had the effect of double-taxing income residents earn in other states.

Maryland allowed its residents to deduct income taxes paid to other states from their Maryland state tax, but it did not apply that deduction to a local ""piggy back"" tax collected for counties and some city governments -- something that the high court decided was illegal.

Yet details about what specific businesses raised the original legal concerns have remained hidden. State leaders have refused to disclose what businesses have requested a refund. The original number of the group of businesses who reached out to lawmakers last fall was originally disclosed at around 80, but on Thursday, Yager mentioned that the law firm represented ""hundreds"" of individuals.

Meanwhile, it's unclear what other possible options were considered. There have also been grumblings that Lee's personal business, the Franklin-based Lee Co., could benefit from this legislation.

On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers pointed out the unusualness of the Republican-dominant Statehouse to move quickly to avoid a lawsuit when GOP members regularly advance legislation knowing it could face potential litigation.

""We are having this discussion as if we have to and we're under the gun,"" said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat. ""I don't think that's appropriate.""

The legislation passed 25-6 on Thursday, with only Democrats voting against. The bill must still clear the House chamber.

""Nobody likes this solution. The governor doesn't like this solution. Revenue doesn't like this solution. The attorney general doesn't like this solution, but the reality is this is the best solution,"" said Sen. Bo Watson, the Republican chair of the Senate's Finance, Ways and Means Committee, as he raised in voice and admonished the Democrats criticizing the plan.

House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters Thursday that his chamber's version of the bill will be different. He said it will include a nearly $400 million tax cut, but the other part of the legislation will differ, and declined to address further specifics while the House's amendment is being drawn up. House Majority Leader William Lamberth said he will likely filed the amendment Monday.

""It will still be a significant tax cut for businesses in Tennessee,"" Lamberth said.

The franchise tax debate comes as Tennessee lawmakers are also being asked by the Republican governor to sign off on an universal school voucher proposal estimated to cost hundreds of millions in tax dollars. Lee has attempted to assure skeptics there is enough revenue to cover all the state's commitments amid stagnant state revenues.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",trentonian.com,news,The Trentonian,,0.05882352941176472,448836100,1,https://www.trentonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

(NewsNation) -- Tax day is right around the corner, and this year, the Internal Revenue Service is offering a free online tax tool that lets eligible taxpayers from 12 states file federal returns directly with the agency.

The new system, called Direct File, is now open 24/7 and available to those with fairly simple tax returns. The pilot program is part of the government's effort to offer a free alternative to commercial tax preparation software like TurboTax.

The Treasury Department estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File and that 19 million taxpayers may be eligible to use the tool this tax season. So far, reviews have been positive.

""Against all odds, the government has created an actually good piece of technology,"" The Atlantic wrote this week. Vox called the program a ""meaningful step"" toward a world where people don't need commercial tax software.

The pilot program is only available to certain taxpayers in 12 states:

The free tool mainly applies to taxpayers with straightforward returns. Those who report income from their jobs (W-2), social security income (SSA-1099), unemployment compensation (1099-G) and interest income (1099-INT) may be eligible.

Those with other types of income, such as gig economy earnings or business income, can't use the program. There are also limitations if your household income is over $125,000.

Taxpayers can only take the standard deduction, which means those who itemize deductions aren't eligible.

There are also rules around health insurance. Taxpayers who bought health insurance directly through a marketplace like HealthCare.gov or withdrew money from a Health Savings Account (HSA) don't qualify.

Direct File doesn't prepare state returns. If you live in Arizona, California, Massachusetts or New York, you will be directed to a state-sponsored tool to file your state return.

Are there other free options?

Direct File isn't the only way to file your taxes for free.

Free File is a partnership between the IRS and tax preparation software companies that allows taxpayers to file their federal tax returns at no cost. Some options also include a free state tax return. The free guided programs are available to taxpayers whose adjusted gross income was $79,000 or less in 2023.

Jon Dunwell told the Jasper County Board of Supervisors this week that although lawmakers are discussing ways to correct issues caused by House File 718 -- a property tax reform law passed last year -- he isn't confident that there will be any action or relief this legislative session.

In an update with the county supervisors on March 19, Dunwell asked if any of them had questions for him regarding specific bills or issues. Supervisor Brandon Talsma asked Dunwell if there would be any corrections to alleviate the issues of House File 718, which he first thought would have minimal impact on the county.

Talsma previously told Newton News that House File 718 has complicated the county's rural services levy. Typically, the county plays a balancing act with rural, general and general supplemental levies, which alters the levies year to year. Good fiscal management has provided the county with the luxury of wiggle room.

House File 718 has also affected city governments in Jasper County. Officials for both Newton and Baxter have spoken out against the bill as being too restrictive and for punishing even small amounts of growth. While the law does sunset in 2029, it has been a punishing setback for local governments setting budgets.

In response to Talsma's question, Dunwell said the issues the law created are more related to distinguishing organic growth from assessment growth. Another issue is when governments have a net taxable valuation above 3 percent they must then use 2 percent of that growth to drop down the levy.

However, if local governments are below 3 percent growth, they can keep 100 percent of that. Which is why many leaders say the law discourages growth.

""The concept of using growth to drop the levy for taxpayers is a good idea, but the question is whether we should -- at least in my mind -- be allowed to keep the first 3 percent and then talk about a waterfall effect that happens after after that 3 percent is achieved,"" Dunwell said.

He also mentioned the bill -- which passed with near unanimous bipartisan support, apart from exactly one lawmaker who voted ""no"" -- was created with a sunset in mind, meaning lawmakers were to come up with another plan to address property taxes before 2029.

""That was meant to say we have to do something and come up with a long-term plan. We'll continue to work on it,"" Dunwell said. ""We've had some conversations with a couple of representatives. Right now the Senate has been leading that discussion and we need to get more in front of it in the House.""

DUNWELL GIVES MORE GENERAL UPDATE ON LEGISLATURE

Prior to his response about House File 718, Dunwell said education sucked the wind out of the Iowa Legislature this year after the governor unveiled her AEA bill. As a result, the House and Senate have belabored their own interpretations of the bill, which will require further negotiations between the two entities.

From Dunwell's perspective, the House's AEA bill that was sent to the Senate was essentially ""gutted."" The House worked with the AEA leadership and superintendents to come up with a task force that would recommend long-term changes, and it also ensured special education stayed underneath AEA.

""It did lay out what could happen in subsequent years, but the task force would ultimately have input on what that would look like long-term,"" Dunwell said. ""It was something that was worked on very diligently with the AEAs. They know something has to be done once the conversation's been started.""

For now, Dunwell said the Iowa Legislature is focusing on a number of education bills -- which have made it past another funnel week -- and the budget. The state is also looking at Medicaid reimbursement covering the costs for local pharmacies filling prescriptions.

""We typically allocated $1.2 million a year. They get so much per prescription for taking care of a Medicaid prescription, and that was not done last year. So they're a year behind,"" Dunwell said. ""So I'm really trying to look at that ... $1.2 million plus the extra $1.2 million -- $2.4 million -- as they go forward.""

As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Dunwell said another issue that has been brought up and will be addressed is pay for judges.

""It's been a long-term, reoccurring issue,"" Dunwell said. ""Iowa kind of lags behind the rest. We're trying to figure out how we can make sure we're compensating our judges. It's getting harder and harder to find judges, so we want to make sure we're keeping pace with what the market has out there.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.0117647058823529,448835658,1,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,

The Houston City Council passed an ordinance this week that will provide a 100% exemption for qualifying childcare providers within the city limits, beginning with the 2024 tax year, and commissioners for surrounding Harris County will consider a similar proposal at their meeting next Tuesday.

Texas voters passed a statewide proposition last November to allow municipalities and counties to provide property tax exemptions of at least 50% for some childcare facilities, in response to widespread closures after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and a shortfall in pandemic-related relief funding from the federal government. The idea is to lessen the financial burden on those providers, allowing them to hire and retain more staff, take in more children and potentially pass their cost savings along to the families they serve.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, Precinct 2 Commissioner Adrian Garcia and Precinct 4 Commissioner Lesley Briones, who are three of the four Democrats on the five-member commissioners court, collaborated on the county's proposal and all expressed support for it in Friday statements to Houston Public Media. Their plan also calls for a 100% property tax exemption for qualifying childcare facilities, of which there are more than 300 across the county, according to Hidalgo's office.

""We are really excited that Houston passed this ... and looking forward to seeing that pass (in Harris County) as well,"" said Mandi Kimball, a vice president for the Houston-based nonprofit Children at Risk. ""Houston and Harris County are both faced with multiple childcare deserts, and the supply is not keeping up with the demand. This will help working families, particularly low-income working families, be able to access the childcare they need.""

RELATED: Houston City Council expected to vote on tax exemptions for childcare facilities

Per the state law approved by Texas legislators last May, which subsequently was ratified in November by more than 60% of voters both in Harris County and across the state, the property tax exemptions apply to owners or operators of childcare facilities that participate in the Texas Rising Star program. As another eligibility requirement, at least 20% of their enrolled children must have their childcare services subsidized through the Texas Workforce Commission.

For property owners who lease their facilities to childcare providers, the law requires those owners to notify the operators that they have received an exemption and the tax break must be factored into their rental rates. Childcare providers receiving exemptions will be not required to reduce their tuitions or keep them at the same rates.

Houston joined Austin and Dallas as the Texas municipalities to have passed the local property tax exemptions, with all three doing so at 100%, according to Kimball.

""We recognize the importance of accessible and high-quality child-care services for our community,"" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said in a statement. ""This ... ordinance reflects our commitment to supporting child-care facilities and ensuring that families have access to the resources they need.""

Harris County had nearly 3,300 childcare facilities at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, and about 21% of those providers had closed by September 2021, according to data from Children at Risk. The ones that stayed open were buoyed by federal funding through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES).

But those funding sources ended in September 2023. At around the same, the Texas Association for the Education of Young Children released a survey of more than 1,800 childcare administrators across the state, which found that 26% of their facilities were likely to close without additional funding and 43% were unsure if they could remain open.

If Harris County passes its property tax exemption for childcare providers, it could save them a total of more than $900,000, according to Hidalgo's office.

""As a mother of three daughters who went to daycare, I know firsthand the critical support childcare providers give to working families,"" Briones said. ""This proposed 100% county property tax exemption is our chance to support those providers, many of whom are still struggling to recover from the pandemic.""",houstonpublicmedia.org,news,Houston Public Media,Adam Zuvanich,0.1686274509803922,448835573,1,https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/25142503/childcarecenter-gp-2017-1500x1000.jpg,eng-9405806

The much-loathed tax has never had more public and political opposition than it does now. But don't expect Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ever abandon what's become his defining policy.

There are now seven provincial premiers calling on Trudeau to pause hiking the carbon tax as planned on April 1. This increase will cause the price of gas to rise by an extra 3 cents, on top of other changes. And an increase in gas prices will cascade down to affect the price of food and other basic goods.

The seven are Doug Ford (Ontario), Danielle Smith (Alberta), Scott Moe (Saskatchewan), Blaine Higgs (New Brunswick), Tim Houston (Nova Scotia), Dennis King (Prince Edward Island), and Andrew Furey (Newfoundland and Labrador).

While six of them are leaders of conservative parties, Furey (no relation) is a Liberal premier. That's the most damning name on the list for Trudeau, given how the Atlantic provinces have typically been strongholds for the Liberals for decades.

That's not all though. On March 21, Trudeau survived a non-confidence vote against the increase to the carbon tax brought forward by Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. This meant that if a majority of MPs had voted against the increase, the government would have toppled and we'd have an election (which Trudeau would without a doubt lose). But because the NDP and Bloc Quebecois sided with the Liberals, the motion failed.

This is a fitting issue to have a non-confidence vote on. Trudeau is incredibly unpopular, and Poilievre is well-liked and currently on pace to become the next PM with a majority government. While it's not uncommon for a PM's popularity to plummet just before they lose office, the current situation is a bit different.

The next election needs to be held on or before October 20, 2025. It'll only happen before then if either the House of Commons has a non-confidence motion and the Liberals lose or if Trudeau decides, for whatever reason, to call one sooner.

This means he could remain as PM for another year and a half. The poll numbers could also remain constant for a year and a half. Trudeau would then be tremendously unpopular, with the voters preferring him to leave immediately, yet he would remain in office pushing through equally unpopular legislation, just like the carbon tax.

Election speculation is an old pastime in federal political circles. Every few months someone with supposed insider knowledge always claims an election is about to be called. But it seems more likely that Trudeau will stick around until the last possible moment, using his time to push through his agenda. This includes the carbon tax.

There are a lot of policies and initiatives that politicians either bring in or abandon almost solely for political or pragmatic reasons. The carbon tax doesn't seem to fall into this category. I've often remarked that we don't have a prime minister who just happens to be interested in climate issues. We have a climate activist who just happens to be prime minister.

Trudeau is a true believer in these aggressive climate change policies, no matter the harms they bring to our economy. We should expect more policies like the carbon tax between now and the election, not fewer.

After all, this isn't the first time the carbon tax has been under siege and Trudeau stuck with it. Prior to the pandemic, Alberta, Ontario, and Saskatchewan fought the federal Liberal government in court to liberate their provinces from the tax. The Liberals wouldn't moderate and took the battle to the Supreme Court (which ruled in their favour).

Trudeau was always willing to make a political wager with the carbon tax, though. Back in 2008, Stephane Dion ran for PM against Stephen Harper on the Green Shift -- which was very similar to the carbon tax we now have. He lost in part because of this policy that Harper successfully -- and accurately -- framed as a ""tax on everything.""

We had the debate back then and the people rejected a carbon tax. Trudeau believed he could slip it in under different branding. He succeeded for a while.

The people aren't falling for it anymore, however. They're resoundingly against it. Just don't expect Trudeau to help them out.",theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,,-0.003921568627450966,448835522,1,https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/22/id5613144-CP168854295-00-1080x720.jpg,eng-9408112

They include tutors, graphic designers, hair stylists, and all kinds of independent and self-employed workers, along with merchants who sell products online through Etsy, eBay, Amazon and other sites. But tax law is still catching up when it comes to how best to report this income.

If you're a freelancer or gig worker who receives payments via apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or PayPal, your tax reporting requirements will change for the 2024 tax year. The law will not affect the amount of taxes owed, but it will change how you report income with 1099-K forms.

The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed. The tax filing deadline is April 15.

For the current tax year, freelancers and small business owners still only need to use 1099-K forms to report third-party app payments totaling $20,000, and any number of payments above 200. But beginning next year, that threshold will be just $5,000, which will eventually be lowered to $600. The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed.

Some in the space say the new law will benefit both freelancers and the IRS by improving information gathering, especially for people who are self-employed and merchants who sell online.

Freelancers, gig workers, and online sellers owe taxes on their income regardless of whether they meet the reporting threshold to use 1099-K forms, but it can be difficult to keep track of every payment, especially across sites and apps. This can lead to confusion and underpayment, experts say.

The eventual change will affect platforms, businesses, and individuals, and it's good to begin preparing now. Here's what you need to know:

WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET READY FOR THE NEW 1099-K REPORTING THRESHOLD?

If you're already keeping accurate track of your income from freelancing as paid via Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, PayPal, and other sites, you're in good shape. The main difference will be that these platforms will issue you additional forms for every transaction. This should make correct reporting to the IRS even easier, though there will be more paperwork.

Currently, if someone paying a freelancer via Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp sends a form to the IRS reporting that pay, but the freelancer doesn't report the income with the same form, that creates a ""matching error"" for the agency. The change will ensure both that taxpayers receive proper refunds and that the IRS receives proper payment.

WHAT IF I MISTAKENLY RECEIVE A 1099-K FORM?

In some cases, in part due to the changing guidance, platforms may send taxpayers 1099-K Forms in error this year - such as for transactions between family and friends or for expense sharing between roommates, according to the IRS.

The first thing to do is try to get an updated form by contacting the company that issued the form incorrectly. If you can't get one in a timely manner, the IRS says to zero out the income on your tax return with the description ""Form 1099-K Received in Error."" The line appears on Form 1040 - Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. There, you should write, as follows: ""Part I - Line 8z - Other Income - Form 1099-K Received in Error.""

WHY DID THE IRS DELAY IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGE FOR A SECOND YEAR IN A ROW?

The change, which had been set to take effect this year, was delayed again in November. The IRS decided to give taxpayers another year to adjust to the new reporting requirements.

""Taking this phased-in approach is the right thing to do for the purposes of tax administration, and it prevents unnecessary confusion,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in November. ""It's clear that an additional delay for tax year 2023 will avoid problems for taxpayers, tax professionals and others in this area.""

WHAT ADVICE AND GUIDANCE DOES THE IRS HAVE FOR FREELANCERS?

The IRS has an online Gig Economy Tax Center that focuses specifically on the tax questions and needs of freelancers and other workers in the informal economy. The site addresses common concerns and pitfalls.

WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE REPORTING INCOME ON 1099-K FORMS?

The IRS will be in touch if they see discrepancies between income reported on 1099-K forms by taxpayers and companies issuing the forms, both this year and next. It's important to keep in mind that income from all platforms, including things like YouTube ads and Patreon subscriptions, must be reported in this way.

One way to make sure all income is accurately captured is to be sure to transfer all payments from your PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts to a traditional bank account, rather than keeping it on third-party platforms.",washingtontimes.com,news,Washington Times,,0.1607843137254903,448835395,1,https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/03/22/Financial_Wellness_Tax_Season_Freelancers_73462_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8,eng-9418558

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

Patrons of hotels, motels and other overnight lodging establishments pay this tax on each room night.

The board's move follows a suggestion on March 12 by Washington County Treasurer Fred Parker, who said raising the rate by 2% would likely yield $100,000 per year.

""The lodging tax is mainly paid by visitors and the visiting tourists and the business people coming to our county,"" Parker said. ""It is not a burden on our residential property owners.""

Berry suggested the tax increase be effective July 1 - the start of the next fiscal year.

This change cannot go into effect until a public hearing is held and the board formally votes on the matter.

Raising the rate would match the transient occupancy - or ""lodging"" - tax charged in nearby localities, Berry said.

The lodging tax rate for the town of Abingdon is 7%, Parker said.

The lodging tax rate in Bristol, Virginia, is 13%, according to the city's website.

The rate is 5% in Smyth County, Virginia, and 8% in the town of Marion.

The action came during Tuesday's work session for the 2024-25 fiscal year budget.

DeSantis signs changes to last year's 'union busting' legislation,"The change will exempt additional public sector unions, such as 911 operators and transit workers.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed legislation updating a law implemented last year barring certain public sector unions from automatically deducting dues from workers' paychecks and requiring a higher threshold of union participation to remain certified.

His signature came in package of 25 other signed bills Friday.

The bill (SB 1746) exempts emergency medical technicians, 911 operators and mass transit workers from last year's law, which requires 60% of workers to be union members in order for the union to remain certified. The law also requires additional reporting for unions.

Democrats were overwhelmingly opposed to the law when it was introduced and ultimately approved last year, noting that it amounted to union busting. They specifically noted that last year's bill targeted teachers' unions, while exempting law enforcement and firefighter unions. Teachers' unions tend to support Democrats for office, while the public safety sector often supports GOP candidates.

Sen. Tina Polsky, this year, again fired back at the legislation noting that it ""seems like it's punitive just to make it harder"" to join a union and for the union to maintain its status.

She and other Democrats voted in favor of an amendment to this year's bill from Sen. Joe Gruters, a Republican, that would have eliminated the requirement to use a membership form issued by the Public Employees Relations Commission in order to remove a duplicative form requirement. Gruters argued there was ""no rationale for having unions complete two membership forms.""

But bill sponsor Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a Republican, said it was ""the only form that has the information that is just prescribed by law"" and the amendment failed 14-22, with Democrats joining Gruters in support.",floridapolitics.com,news,Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced plans to start the environmental review for another project while the Treasury Department finally issued long-awaited updates on the tax credits the industry views as essential to its planning.

BOEM reports that it will commence the environmental review of the plan submitted for Vineyard Northeast, the second project from Copenhagen Investment Partners which already has the Vineyard Wind Farm under construction with Avangrid. This second project calls for 2.6 GW of capacity located 29 miles offshore of Nantucket, Massachusetts.

The Vineyard Northeast proposal includes the installation of up to 160 wind turbine generators, up to three electrical service platforms, and one booster station in an adjacent lease area. It also envisions two offshore export cable corridors, one to Connecticut and one to Massachusetts, and associated onshore transmission systems.

This will be the 13th review initiated by the Biden administration and follows an announcement just a week ago to also start the view for Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, which will be off the coast of New Jersey. Last month, the bureau reported it had completed the review for the New England Wind project to be located offshore Massachusetts, while it is also working on broader reviews for the New York Bight, the Central Atlantic, and now the Gulf of Maine.

The industry has also been calling for clarification and steps to implement the tax credits outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. Eleven months ago they issued the first rules prompting questions from companies in the wind and other sectors. Ørsted and others cited in 2023 the challenges in gaining the credits as presenting a hurdle or the reason for abandoning some of their planned projects.

The Department of the Treasury today issued the long-awaited guidance for the requirements to gain the bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy projects and facilities. Developers can receive a bonus of up to 10 percentage points on top of the Investment Tax Credit and an increase of 10 percent for the Production Tax Credit. The act provides a base 30 percent credit for renewable energy projects.

Saying that offshore wind projects make significant investments and create jobs at eligible ports over the duration of the projects, the guidance provided steps permitting offshore wind facilities to attribute their nameplate capacity to additional property in these ports. The guidance also clarifies details for a project that has multiple points of interconnection.

The Treasury Department says these steps will provide additional support to low-income communities by locating the equipment and jobs in those areas. The guidance was critical to the industry which was seeking additional information on the steps required for these credits.",maritime-executive.com,news,Maritime Executive,,0.1529411764705881,448834869,1,https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Windfarms/Vineyard-Wind-1-turbine-power.jpeg.047333.jpg,eng-9414022

But it could cost Louisiana millions.,"A House committee has advanced a proposal that would reduce the severance tax on oil extracted in the state by 4 percentage points over eight years.

Rep. Beau Beaullieu, who sponsored House Bill 259, told the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday he hopes the bill will boost the oil industry by ""(making) Louisiana a more attractive place to do business."" His goal is to ""bring back the jobs, to grow production and ultimately grow what is coming into the state,"" he said.

The committee sent the bill to the full House without objection.

But some warn the tax cut proposed in HB 259, which would gradually step the rate down from 12.5% to 8.5%, will leave a gaping hole in the state's budget.

According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, reducing the severance tax will cost the state nearly $107 million over the next five years. Once the rate is down to 8.5%, it could leave the state short about $80 million annually, predicted Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, formerly known as the Louisiana Budget Project.

""The state needs all the money it can get, especially because we're facing a fiscal cliff,"" said Jan Moller, referring to the anticipated half-billion-dollar budget shortfall the state is expected to face after the .45-cent sales tax rolls off next year. ""This is $80 million that we'll be giving to oil producers that could be going to educating children, providing health care, police protection and other services that citizens expect and rely on.""

Supporters of the bill counter that though it lowers the tax, generating more business could increase revenue.

""Hopefully we would counter lowering the severance,"" Rep. Jacob Landry, R-Erath, president of Industrial and Oilfield Services, told the committee. ""This bill is to grow production, not just cut severance and say we're losing money.""

But Ben Vincent, who works for the Legislative Fiscal Office, said he doubted the economic impacts would offset more than 5% to 15% of the revenue loss. However, his office did not account for business growth in its analysis.

Supporters of HB 259 also argued Louisiana has lost business to Texas and New Mexico because it has a high severance tax rate. But while that tax is higher in Louisiana than in Texas, for example, that is just one part of the bigger picture.

Louisiana does not have a reserve tax -- a property tax based on the value of unextracted oil on a property. Texas does have that tax, and states across the country have different systems for taxing oil.

Legislators have tried to pass various versions of severance tax cut proposals in recent years, but they have not garnered enough support to become law.

The Louisiana Oil and Gas Association supports HB 259. However, it is unclear how much such a cut would do to stimulate Louisiana's much-diminished oil industry.

Guy Cormier, executive director of the Police Jury Association, testified in opposition to the bill because a small portion of the severance tax revenue goes to parishes.

He understood what lawmakers were trying to do, he said. Cormier worked in the oil and gas industry for two decades.

But ""I don't think this one issue is going to fix the oil and gas industry,"" he said.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

The , released Friday by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, found the IRS significantly reduced the number of unprocessed tax returns and other kinds of tax account work last year, and many of the functions in its tax processing centers have gone back to pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, there are still some problem areas.

""Delays in processing backlogged tax returns and other types of tax account work burden taxpayers, including delays in receiving their refunds,"" said the report. ""Further, significant inventories of tax account work continue to delay the resolution of taxpayer account issues including the review of amended tax returns and other Accounts Management work.""

The IRS implemented a Get Healthy Plan in 2022 with the goal of returning the IRS to pre-pandemic inventory levels by the end of that year. While implementation of those initiatives led to a significant reduction of the backlogged inventories in the IRS's tax processing centers, TIGTA still voiced concerns about the number of suspended returns, including tax returns in the Rejects, Unpostables, and Files functions of the IRS. The report also expressed concerns about the inventories of amended tax returns that still need to be worked on, which are significantly above pre-pandemic levels.

The IRS's Accounts Management function inventories also remain above pre-pandemic levels. As of Oct. 28, 2023, there were 4.3 million Accounts Management cases, excluding amended returns, awaiting processing compared to 4.4 million as of October 29, 2022. Of these 4.3 million Accounts Management cases, 2.8 million were ""aged"" cases, which can range anywhere from four to 180 days in inventory.

TIGTA also reviewed taxpayer concerns about delays in receiving tax refunds and identified 121,449 tax year 2020 tax accounts with overpayments totaling $783.3 million that were delayed or erroneously held from issuance, due to errors in programming changes made by the IRS.

TIGTA made two recommendations in the report to the IRS, saying the agency should identify a process to review and release the overpayments that are being erroneously held, and to perform an analysis of tax year 2019 tax accounts with abated Failure to File penalties to identify additional tax accounts where overpayments are being held. The IRS agreed with both of those recommendations.

""Since mid-2020, when our facilities reopened, we faced and addressed significant obstacles to processing these inventories by equipping our employees to perform their duties remotely,"" wrote Kenneth Corbin, commissioner of the IRS's Wage and Investment Division, in response to the report. ""We also hired additional employees to address the accumulated inventories. Initiatives were launched to modernize workstreams that permit both the electronic submission of documents by taxpayers and for that work to be processed electronically.""

He noted that the modernization efforts are continuing this year, scanning paper tax returns and converting them into electronic format, building on the 1.5 million returns that were scanned in 2023.

Overall, the efforts seem to be helping with tax season. ""Based on the number of questions we're getting and the general level of panic, it seems to me like, for reasons I can't necessarily explain, this tax season seems to be going a little more smoothly,"" said Bill Smith, director of tax technical services at CBIZ MHM's National Tax Office. ""I would guess that it has to do with the fact that there hasn't been much change in how things get reported over the last few years.""

Inflation adjustments seem to be helping many taxpayers qualify for slightly higher refunds, 6.0% higher, according to the for the week ending March 15. The IRS has received over 71.5 million so far this tax season.

The IRS's have been helping many taxpayers this tax season. ""The changes in the tax brackets from 2022 to 2023 are of the greatest benefit to the middle class, those earning between $89,000 single filers or $95,000 joint filers and $230,000 single filers or $460,000 joint filers, and will result in tax savings from about $1,500 to $4,000, with the highest savings in the 32% bracket (single filers of up to $231,249, joint filers of up to$462,499),"" said Paul Miller, managing partner of . ""W-2 taxpayers expecting these tax savings will result in greater tax refunds or less tax due however, may be unpleasantly surprised. The federal tax withholding charts were adjusted in 2023 to synchronize with the new tax brackets, which resulted in less tax withheld per pay period.

Researchers have uncovered a significant security vulnerability in Apple's M-series chips, raising concerns about the safety of crypto private keys stored on Mac computers.

According to a recent report, the vulnerability, a side-channel exploit, allows malicious actors to extract encryption keys while the Apple chips are executing commonly used cryptographic protocols. Unlike typical vulnerabilities that can be addressed through software patches, this particular flaw resides in the microarchitectural design of the chips themselves, rendering it ""unpatchable.""

To mitigate the issue, third-party cryptographic software would need to be employed, but this could severely impact the performance of earlier M-series chips, including the M1 and M2.

The findings shed light on a fundamental weakness in Apple's hardware security infrastructure. Hackers can intercept and exploit memory access patterns to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including encryption keys utilized by cryptographic applications.

The researchers have given this type of attack the name ""GoFetch"" exploit, which operates seamlessly within the user environment and requires standard user privileges like regular applications.

Following the disclosure of this research, Mac users in online forums have expressed concerns and raised questions about the potential impact on password keychains. Some users believe that Apple will address the problem directly within its operating system, while others express greater worry if the company fails to do so. One user speculated that the upcoming M3 chip might include an additional instruction to disable the vulnerable feature, referring to previous research known as ""augury.""

This discovery adds to the mounting challenges faced by Apple, including an ongoing antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ). The lawsuit alleges stifled competition and innovation due to Apple's App Store rules and its alleged monopoly on digital wallets and payment services.

But lately, county leaders have been scrambling to pay their bills. They spent $700,000 in limited federal COVID relief dollars last year simply to try to keep the local judicial system afloat. They'd pulled money from dwindled reserves, raided the road levy fund and put off construction, all to make the budget balance one more year.

And this year? They'll need to cut another 15% from the general fund.

""We're out of cash. We don't have any money left,"" said Franklin County Administrator Mike Gonzalez. ""That part is a part that keeps me up at night. You're like, 'Holy cow, if we really got into a pickle, how are we going to pay for all this?'""

A strategic financial report pegged the problem as deep and structural: ""County revenues are simply not growing fast enough to keep up with expenses.""

""If we cannot figure out a way to pay for these costs,"" Gonzalez said, ""we're going to be letting criminals out on the street, we are not going to be able to hire corrections officers to staff jails, prosecuting attorneys are going to be nonexistent.""

Counties across Washington, of all sizes, are on the same kind of financial precipice. Many county officials blame the handcuffs that the Legislature has put on property taxes, their most crucial revenue source.

No matter how fast property values increase, state law only lets most local governments increase their property tax revenue from existing properties by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures. Washington's cap on property taxes is among the strictest in the country.

That restriction has dogged county budgets for decades, but in this moment -- as inflation has soared -- it's hammering them harder than ever. The Washington State Auditor's Office has identified ""concerning"" or ""cautionary"" issues with the budgets of 29 of Washington's 39 counties, and in more than 200 cities or towns.

During last year's State of the County speech, King County Executive Dow Constantine warned that, because of the property tax cap, they stood to lose health clinics, domestic violence victim resources and even ""funding our elections staff needs to protect our democracy.""

""They've been holding things together with chewing gum and baling wire for the last few decades,"" state Sen. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, said of local county governments. ""The ways that they learned to do that just stopped working in a high-inflation environment.""

Yet the state, county leaders say, not only hasn't been able to pass legislation to fix the problem, it's made things worse by heaping on new responsibilities with little extra aid.

""The financial system is collapsing, and we in the counties have been left to hold the bag,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're collapsing and the state is not doing anything about it but waiting and watching the system implode.""

Washington state's property tax cap began, as so many headaches for government budget wonks have, with a voter initiative championed by anti-tax activist Tim Eyman.

In 2000, voters passed an Eyman-backed initiative that lowered the cap on property tax revenue increases -- then at a maximum of 6% -- to 2%. When a coalition of cities and counties filed a lawsuit to overturn that initiative, Eyman decided to play hardball.

""The following year, we said, 'OK, you dirty dogs. You keep suing us every time we vote for something? You don't like 2%? How about 1%? We're gonna cross out the number 2 and replace it with 1,'"" Eyman said.

Eyman's Initiative 747 passed easily. And by 2007, when a lawsuit threw out the 1% cap as well, the cap had become so embedded within voter expectations that the Democratic governor held a special session of the Legislature to immediately reimpose it.

While some states, like Oregon, have property caps limiting increases in individual tax bills, Washington's cap limits the total revenue the government brings in. All assessments of existing property do is determine how that cost is divided among property taxpayers -- how the pie is split up. If your property increases in value faster than your neighbors', you pay for a bigger slice. But the only way the whole pie can grow faster than 1% a year is through voter-approved levies or new construction, which isn't limited by the cap.

Derek Young, a former Pierce County councilmember, compares the structure to an anaconda wrapped around the ribcage of local governments. Suffocation happens slowly.

""Each time you take a breath, it squeezes a little more in,"" Young said. ""Over time, eventually, you've got no more room to breathe.""

But now, counties -- which rely almost entirely on property and sales tax -- can feel their ribs begin to crack. Property values have increased one-and-and-a-half times faster than tax revenues have since the initiative passed.

In 2001, the average taxpayer was paying nearly $1,300 in property taxes for every $100,000 of property value. Today, they're paying an average of only $850 per $100,000.

Local governments have faced financial challenges before, particularly with the collapse of sales tax revenue during the recession in the wake of the 2008 housing crash. Yet today's economic climate is nearly the opposite: Housing prices have soared, retail sales have spiked, unemployment is low and the slew of job openings have pushed up wages sharply.

Many local governments initially got a boost to their budgets through federal aid and increased sales tax revenue. Cities, like Seattle, proudly launched a flurry of new spending with that temporary extra revenue, only to find themselves staring into a budget-deficit abyss when the money ran out.

The nation was hit with the biggest burst of inflation since 1981. Retirements from COVID had created a labor shortage. Local governments across the state found themselves in bidding wars, trying to hire police, corrections officers and public defenders away from one another and driving up costs.

Housing values spiked too -- increasing rent, increasing homelessness, and increasing how much local governments had to shell out to fund new clinics and shelters.

Pierce County watched its two-year jail costs increase by almost $20 million. Tiny Wahkiakum County, northwest of Vancouver, saw the cost of its auto, facilities and liability insurance nearly double. In Franklin County, fuel costs -- pushed even higher by the state's new carbon penalties -- hit the county's public works budget.

Counties had to start cutting. Pierce eliminated nine vacant corrections officer positions. Thurston ended supervised probation in District Court. King cut the county sheriff's department's overtime.

The property tax cap is a big reason why Washington state has had the lowest number of police officers for its population in the nation for over a decade, said Young.

""We already 'defunded police,'"" Young recalled joking with the Legislature. ""You did that for us.""

Yet as counties have struggled to keep their budgets above water, local leaders have been increasingly frustrated that the state has pushed so much of the burden of providing services on to local governments.

By 2012, so much of the responsibility for funding schools had been shifted to local school districts to pass levies that the state Supreme Court ruled legislators had violated the state constitution's ""paramount duty"" to fund education, eventually fining the Legislature $100,000 a day until they fixed it.

So in 2017, the state simply suspended the 1% limit from the property taxes dedicated to statewide school funding for the next four years. But counties and cities don't have that option, at least not without a ballot measure.

Voters legalized marijuana more than a decade ago, but the state only gave local governments a trickle of the marijuana tax revenue collected. Meanwhile, for state-mandated areas like public defense, the cost for counties keeps increasing, while the state contribution has remained flat.

A year ago, Gonzalez said, Franklin County was paying entry-level public defender attorneys $85,000. Today, they're offering $116,500. A 1% hike in property tax revenues in Franklin County, Gonzalez said, barely pays the salary of one.

""We don't have a single system of social services in the state. We have 39,"" Young said. ""What do we do for people like in Pierce County, where they're struggling to raise enough revenue to provide just basic services?""

Over the last two decades, plenty of Washington state legislators have tried, and failed, to reform the property tax cap. But a high-inflation environment is a particularly perilous time to propose such a bill.

Surrounding states with looser property cap restrictions, like Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, have been scrambling to find ways to reduce taxes to placate furious voters over their rising property taxes.

Nevertheless, Sen. Pedersen took his best shot. His bill this year would have given counties the option of increasing property taxes cap by up to 3% a year.

Despite their lock on the Legislature in Washington state, Democrats were quickly put on the defensive.

Senate Republicans were merciless: They pumped out social media featuring a steady stream of #StopTheGreed hashtags, a video featuring a drawing of a man labeled ""government"" fist pumping next to a cash-register ringing ""ch-ching,"" and warnings that the Democrats wanted to ""TRIPLE, TRIPLE, TRIPLE"" the maximum growth rate of your property taxes.

Republicans pointed to the overall growth of revenue in areas like King County in the last decade -- faster than inflation, they said -- to argue that budget complaints are overblown.

They held a press conference decrying the proposal as the worst bill of the session, accusing Democrats of being ""tone deaf"" to the suffering of families, arguing that lifting the cap would inflame the housing shortage and cause rent to increase. In their eyes, the cap helped stop the government from getting too big too fast.

""It should be hard for local government to budget. It should be,"" said Sen. Drew MacEwen, R-Shelton. ""And I think that's lost on this Legislature.""

Another politician at the press conference incorrectly claimed that Democrats would raise your property taxes by ""300%."" Online, commenters worried that, for example, their $9,000 tax bill was poised to leap to $27,000.

That, as Eyman readily acknowledges, wasn't true. Yet more than 8,000 people signed up to testify that they were opposed to Pedersen's bill.

Democrats began to balk. Sen. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, who had been narrowly reelected in 2022 and is now running for Congress, pulled her support as a co-sponsor from Pedersen's bill, citing opposition from her constituents.

Even if the bill managed to pass, there was no guarantee it would stick. On social media, Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, had already started filling out the referendum paperwork to let voters repeal the bill. The bill was left to die.

With multiple other voter initiatives threatening to imperil the state's own new sources of revenue -- like the capital gains tax -- Democrats were cautious.

""A conversation about property taxes that people don't really understand in this particular year would likely be an unwelcome distraction,"" Pedersen said.

Eyman always has a simple counter to all the local government complaints that they're ""starving"": Simply pass a local levy.

""'Oh, we desperately need more money?' OK, make your case to the people who are going to pay it that you need more money,"" Eyman said. ""That's always been there, and that's always undercut every argument they've ever made.""

King County, where three-quarters of voters picked Biden, readily passes taxes, including plenty of levies aiding parks, veterans services and mental health. Include them in the calculation, and the county's overall spending has largely kept up with inflation. But until new legislation passed this year, state law had banned King County -- and only King County -- from using levy funding to pay for services in their general fund.

In more conservative areas like Stevens County, where 70% of the voters voted for Trump, however, the problem is more political.

""If I go to the voters and try and convince them that that money is for paying for the assessor, and the treasurers and recording and elections, it's not going to pass in my area,"" Stevens County Commissioner Wes McCart told the Legislature. ""At what point do I stop providing services?""

Just one more mandate from the state, some officials worry, could push some counties over the edge. With the Washington State Bar Association proposing case-load standards that could potentially double or triple costs on counties, Gonzalez warned in a recent press release, ""this could be what bankrupts smaller counties like ours.""

But Franklin County commissioners haven't seemed interested in proposing a new property tax levy, Gonzalez said. They haven't been interested in raising the property cap either.

""I appreciate that our area commissioners are living within the means provided by the taxpayers, even if it makes budgeting more challenging,"" Sen. Perry Dozier, R-Waitsburg, wrote in a post last month. ""Putting this bill down was the right move, although if the majority respected the will of the voters it never would have been introduced in the first place.""

But the worsening state of security in the country has heightened such calls.

As the clamour for state police grows stronger, the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has faulted 16 governors' submission of a report on the matter to the National Economic Council (NEC).

On Thursday, NEC confirmed receiving memoranda from 16 governors who expressed their support for establishing state police to address the myriads of security challenges facing the nation.

Although the names of the governors were not given, 20 other governors were yet to forward their reports to enable the NEC to act on them.

Barely a day after the announcement, Governor Makinde who appeared as a guest on Channels Television's Politics Today described the governors' actions as a waste of time.

""I did not submit any memorandum on state police but my position is very clear about state police. I see it, quite frankly, as a waste of our time,"" he said on Friday.

""I did not submit not because of arrogance but because I don't think the approach will quickly get us to where we want to go. You are asking the states to submit memoranda on how state police will work.""

They Know What To Do

Makinde said the issue of the state police can best be handled by the National Assembly and not the National Economic Council or the National Security Adviser.

He argued that the issue must pass through the parliament since it is a constitutional matter before being replicated at the state houses of assembly.

""The National Assembly, they know what to do. They have people that can quickly do this work. It is not the National Security Adviser or the National Economic Council that will deal with the issue of state police.

""It is a constitutional thing and should go to the National Assembly and then at the state level, we get our state houses of assembly to pass this law,"" the governor said.

Quest For State Police

The clamour for state police has been an age-long issue in Nigeria. But the worsening state of security in the country has heightened such calls.

Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on February 12 restated their position on state policing, as the solution to the country's worsening security situation, lamenting that Nigeria is ""almost on the road to Venezuela"".

Also, regional socio-political groups such as Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum, and the Northern Elders' Forum, have repeatedly called for state police as a solution to the myriad of increasing security challenges confronting the nation.

Already, states in the South-West geopolitical zone have formed the Amotekun while their counterparts in the South-East also created a security outfit Ebube Agu. The Benue Guards has also been operational in Benue State in the North Central while states like Katsina, Zamfara, and other bandit-prone sub-nationals have also come up with similar state-established outfits.

However, these outfits have not been as effective as anticipated as they do not have the backing of the Federal Government. States continue to demand that Amotekun, Ebube Agu, and others be granted license to bear assault rifles like AK-47s to confront lethal gun-toting marauders.",channelstv.com,news,Channels Television,Ignatius Igwe,0.01960784313725483,448834305,1,https://www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Makinde3.jpg,eng-9419601

(KXNET) -- Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) Nation Chairman Mark Fox, Gov. Doug Burgum and State Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus signed an alcohol tax revenue sharing agreement today, March 22, 2024.

In March 2023, the state Legislature passed legislation (SB-2377) which allows each of the five tribal nations in North Dakota to enter an agreement with the state.

Last March, Fox commented on SB-2377 by saying, ""This bill provides a fair mechanism to share taxes generated from the sale and consumption of alcohol on the reservation."" ""The tribal share collected under SB-2377 will help develop and provide resources for addiction treatment, law enforcement, community safety, and wellness programs.""

SB-2377 improved upon a previous bill passed in 2019, which went unutilized.

The alcohol tax revenue sharing agreement agreement will impose a single tax on alcoholic beverages sold at the retail and wholesale levels within their respective reservations.

""The MHA Nation has been contending with the impacts of alcohol being sold on our reservation for a very long time, "" Fox said. ""This new tax revenue will help relieve the tremendous amount of money our government spends yearly to provide treatment services related to alcohol addiction, social and wellness services, and supplement enhancements to law enforcement.""

In her first appearance in the NCAA Tournament, Fulwiley dazzled like she has for most of her first college season. After winning the MVP of the SEC Tournament, Fulwiley scored 17 points to lead the top-seeded Gamecocks to a 91-39 victory over No. 16 seed Presbyterian on Friday afternoon at the Colonial Life Arena.

Fulwiley knocked down a season-best five three-pointers and was 5 of 10 from beyond the arc. Fulwiley scored 12 of her points in the first half, but she ended up with plenty of help as five South Carolina players scored in double figures.

Chloe Kitts tied her career-high with 21 points. Te-Hina Paopao added 18 points in her first tournament game at South Carolina. Sania Feagin chipped in with 12 points and Raven Johnson added 11.

This one was closer than when these two teams played on December 16. The Gamecocks won that one by 99-29. The Blue Hose, playing in its first NCAA Tournament after winning its first Big South tournament title, almost reached that scoring mark in the first half, when South Carolina led 48-25 at the break.

But the team from up I-26 in Clinton only scored two points in the fourth quarter.

The Gamecocks advance to a second-round matchup with No. 8-seeded North Carolina. The Tar Heels survived a late scare to hold off Michigan State, 59-56, in the first game on Friday. Those two will square off on Sunday at a time to be announced later. The Gamecocks and Tar Heels played on Nov. 30, with South Carolina claiming a 65-58 victory.

The 33-0 Gamecocks were without All-American Kamilla Cardoso and Bree Hall.

She reminded people that citrus peels are edible and don't have to be tossed in the garbage, stuck the label ""scrappy cooking"" on her video and walked away.

The response was electrifying.

""I came back an hour later, and that video had been viewed by millions of people,"" said the Barrie, Ont., cookbook author and food blogger.

""Everybody had struck up this conversation about food waste that previously wasn't being had. I just thought, 'Wow.""'

That ""scrappy"" culinary moment appeared to strike a chord with millions of people who were stressed out by rising food prices and ever-tighter family budgets.

It became the inspiration for Bodrug's soon-to-be-released second cookbook, and inspired her popular social media series where she shares tips such as how to make pesto using the tops of carrots and beets or how to turn potato peels into a delicious crispy snack.

According to a 2021 UN report, the average Canadian household produces 79 kilograms of food waste per year. This refers to food that is thrown out because of issues like improper storage, overbuying, inefficiently used ingredients going bad, and poor planning.

Wasted food has an environmental impact, in that disposed-of organic material in landfills is a source of greenhouse gas emissions.

But it's also, as Bodrug puts it, ""literally like throwing money down the drain.""

In Canada, the National Zero Waste Council has estimated that more than a third of food produced and distributed domestically never gets eaten, and that $49 billion worth of food in this country is sent to landfill or composted each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that a family of four wastes about US$1,500 in food annually.

""I polled my audience a couple of weeks ago on what the average family spends on groceries in a week, and it was over $200 in groceries,"" said Bodrug, who now has 3.2 million followers on the social media website TikTok.

""I mean, there's huge opportunities there for saving.""

Joshna Maharaj, a Toronto-based chef and activist, said she's fascinated by the ""scrappy cooking"" movement and the sudden popularity of making fresh pickles with leftover brine from a store-bought jar of dills, or freezing the green tops of strawberries for smoothies.

While the trend is obviously rooted in the current cost-of-living crisis, Maharaj said she believes there's also some nostalgia there for earlier time periods when nearly all cooking was done at home and nothing went to waste. Some Canadians may recall the budget-friendly recipes or household economy habits of their grandparents, who may have learned how to conserve during the Great Depression or Second World War.

""People have a longing for being in the kitchen, but we've become so disconnected from it over time that we have a fear and anxiety about it,"" Maharaj said.

""But regardless of what time period we're living in, I can confidently say that cooking your food for yourself at home is the most nutritious and economical way for you to eat. There's no question.""

It's possible to work toward a full-fledged zero-waste kitchen, doing things like using spent coffee grounds to flavour cookies and brownies or regrowing green onions by planting the leftover white tips.

But Maharaj said for most people, developing simple habits like weekly meal planning and regular fridge and pantry clean-outs can significantly reduce the amount of food they throw away.

""Omelettes and frittatas are a wonderful way to use up scraps. Make friends with dishes like soups,"" Maharaj said.

""What's required here is just more habits and intention and time spent.""

Canning, fermenting, dehydrating and freezing are also great ways to reduce food waste, especially if you have a garden or are buying in bulk from the farmer's market, said Heather O'Shea, the Whitby, Ont., woman behind the blog ""From Hustle to Homestead.""

O'Shea also suggests home cooks keep a bag in their freezer where they toss bits of onion, tops of carrots, celery leaves and other produce scraps throughout the week. When the bag is full, simmer the works in a big pot with some salt and pepper for flavourful home-made vegetable broth.

""Never, never buy soup stock at the store if you can make it from what you would have thrown away,"" she said.

The key, O'Shea said, is to start small and not to get overwhelmed.

""Start with what you can start with. Don't try to do everything at once,"" she said.

""There's a lot you can do to both save money and reduce food waste, so start with one thing, and then add another thing in time.""",cp24.com,news,Pulse24.com                        ,,-0.0980392156862745,448834206,1,https://www.cp24.com/polopoly_fs/1.6818582.1711136610!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

WASHINGTON, March 22 - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, Pensions (HELP) Committee, this week introduced legislation that would ensure that the United States finally joins virtually every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing workers the right to earn paid annual vacation leave. This legislation comes just a week after Sanders introduced legislation and held a HELP Committee hearing on establishing a 32-hour workweek in America with no loss in pay.

Sanders is joined on the Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) while Rep. Seth Magaziner (RI-02) introduced companion legislation in the House.

""It is time to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid vacation days to workers,"" said Sen. Sanders. ""We hear a lot of talk about family values in America, but let's be clear: When a husband, wife, and kids, during the course of an entire year, are unable to spend any time together on vacation, that is not a family value. That is an attack on everything that a family is supposed to stand for. It's not a radical idea to require companies in America to provide at least two weeks of paid vacation to their workers. What's radical is that millions of Americans are not only working longer hours for lower wages, but that they do not receive a single paid vacation day in the year 2024. That should not be happening in the United States of America, the richest country in the history of the world.""

""Americans who put in an honest day's work deserve to take time off, and I'm proud to introduce the House companion to this legislation to make this a reality for all,"" said Rep. Magaziner. ""This is a matter of fairness and respect in the workplace. No one works harder than American workers, and they have earned a break.""

While millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the U.S. remains the only major economy in the world to not guarantee some type of paid vacation time to its people. Today in Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many countries in Europe, workers are guaranteed at least 10 days of paid vacation. In other countries, such as France, Austria, and Belgium, paid vacation benefits are even stronger.

Meanwhile in the U.S., nearly 40 percent of workers are on the job at least 50 hours a week and a staggering 18 percent are clocking at least 60 hours a week, as of 2019. The average full-time worker in the U.S. now works 42 hours a week - an estimate that does not necessarily account for those working multiple jobs. On top of this, more than 8 million Americans work multiple jobs, with 4.7 million working a second part-time job on top of a full-time job. The American worker does all of this without a federal guarantee of earned paid vacation time.

If passed, the Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act would ensure that:

According to a recent study, the benefits of taking time off from work include higher productivity, greater employee retention, increased workplace morale, and significant health benefits.

Lack of paid time off has a significant negative impact on not only the employee, but the society as a whole. A study by Oxford Economics found benefits of taking time off from work include higher productivity, greater employee retention, increased workplace morale, and significant health benefits.

The study also found that when people take time off, the economy benefits. For example, if employees who already get time off took the full amount they were eligible for, the economy would benefit from more than $160 billion in total business sales, $21 billion in tax revenues, and 1.2 million additional jobs would be supported in industries like retail and manufacturing.

The Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act is endorsed by the Center for Law and Social Policy, Economic Opportunity Institute, Economic Policy Institute, Family Equality, Family Values @ Work, MomsRising, Mothering Justice, NAACP, National Employment Law Project, National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women's Law Center, Oxfam America, Paid Leave for All, SEIU (Service Employees International Union), SMART (International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers), UnidosUS, UNITE HERE, Women Employed, and ZERO TO THREE.",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.02745098039215677,448833842,1,,eng-9412354

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said.

Hunger in Maine is a persistent problem with food insecurity in the Pine Tree States significantly higher than the national average. In Maine, 10 percent of people -- and, worse, one in seven children -- face hunger, according to Feeding America.

There is a relatively new way for Mainers to help ease this persistent problem. When filing your state tax forms this year, you can check a box to donate money to a hunger relief fund. An emergency food assistance fund is one of eight charitable checkoffs on Schedule CP, which accompanies the state's standard 1040ME tax form. The form allows a portion -- or all -- of a person's tax refund to be directed to one or several of these funds.

The checkoff is the result of legislation passed by lawmakers in 2021. You can also donate to funds that benefit children, military members, veterans, public libraries, wildlife, and companion pets, or to support childhood cancer research.

The minimum contribution is $5 and you can donate to multiple funds. You can also use your state income tax refund to purchase state park passes through Schedule CP.

Money collected through the Emergency Food Assistance Program checkoff will go toward a program run by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Food pantries and other emergency food providers can apply for assistance from the fund.

""Hunger and food insecurity carries an immense stigma. It's not something we typically like to talk about,"" the bill's sponsor, Rep. Maureen Terry, D-Gorham, said in testimony in March 2021.

""To me, this checkoff option is just like making dinner for a sick friend or community member in need of a little extra TLC. It provides a way for more of our neighbors experiencing food insecurity to access meals without all of the added stress and fear often associated with asking for help,"" she added. Terry is a chef and former restaurant owner, who now operates a cookie company and serves on the boards of two farmers markets.

""During my 10 years in this office, I have seen increasing levels of poverty and increasing food insecurity. Of course, the pandemic has made such matters even worse,"" Alan Casavant, the then-mayor of Biddeford, said in testimony in 2021 in support of the bill. ""This bill represents a simple way in which individuals can assist those in need. ... With so many of our neighbors struggling day to day, it is important, I think, to add new tools to the proverbial tool box to assist them in any way that we can.""

This new tool offers an easy way for Mainers to help their neighbors in need.

So, as you complete your tax forms, don't forget to fill out Schedule CP if you'd like to donate a portion of your tax refund to the worthy cause of your choice.",bangordailynews.com,news,Bangor Daily News,Bdn Editorial Board,-0.06666666666666665,448833713,1,https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/03/bd2664f5-6b1c-4edd-a4e0-0ea426c80f49-1.jpg,

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said. ""I think we should all move forward more cautiously until we get a better read on what the new normal will be like.""",dailycamera.com,news,Boulder Daily Camera,,0.05882352941176472,448833470,1,https://www.dailycamera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-NEWS-STATES-RETHINKING-PROJECTS-GET.jpg?w=640,

The increase in waste responds to the increase in boats participating in the Pesca Neta project, which involves 900 fishermen. Among the Tarragona ports, l'Ametlla de Mar is the one that has removed the most waste, 10,887 liters.

According to the fishermen, most of the waste is plastic, especially sanitary wipes, packaging, but also drums, cans and other items such as wood, tar and coal from old boats. The entire Catalan fleet has been participating in this initiative for three years, which has recorded the removal of 240,000 liters of garbage, half of them last year.

Before arriving at port, the fishermen of L'Ametlla de Mar record through a mobile application all the waste that has become entangled in the nets during their workday, along with the fish of the day.

They classify it based on type and weight, in addition to complementing it with photographs that document the discovery. ""Normally we collect between ten and fifteen kilos, today has been a good day because there have been less,"" said Juanma Margalef, skipper of a boat from L'Ametlla de Mar.

Factors such as rough seas, storms or distance from land have a direct impact on the discovery of waste.

According to Margalef, the most common products found are pieces of plastic, especially containers, but also glass bottles, paint drums and on occasion even washing machines or batteries from other boats.

Throughout Catalonia, 120,000 liters of garbage extracted from the sea have been recorded throughout 2023. This is double the previous year and half of what was collected in the three years of the Net Fishing program.

Sources from the Department of Climate, Food and Rural Agenda suggest that these data would be equivalent to eighteen tankers of marine garbage. The deputy director of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Itziar Segarra, has pointed out that these data respond to the increase in fishermen who use the mobile application where they record the garbage removed daily and which has accounted for more than 3,000 hours of the fishermen's workdays.

According to data from the department, the port that has recorded the greatest removal of waste on the entire Catalan coast is that of Palamós, in Girona, after collecting 28,052.25 liters of garbage.

In the Barcelona district, Vilanova y la Geltrú leads the ranking with 19,694 liters, while in Tarragona, L'Ametlla de Mar, with six boats participating in Pesca Neta, has removed 10,887 liters. At a global level, the Barcelona district has collected 34,968.10 liters of garbage, the Girona district 58,527.25 liters and finally Tarragona 26,778 liters.

All Catalan fishermen are involved in the Pesca Neta project, although Acció Climàtica recognizes that not all use the mobile application where the waste collected is recorded daily. Thus, they point out that the volume of garbage removed is greater.

The project aims to evaluate the impact of the human factor on marine pollution and improve the recovery of the marine environment, in addition to compensating the fishing sector for its dedication to this initiative.

In this context, one million euros per year is allocated to this program, which is distributed among the federations of participating fishermen's associations, with co-financing from the European fund that this year rises to 70%.

On the other hand, from the L'Ametlla de Mar fishermen's brotherhood, its president Miquel Brull has celebrated the participation of all the boats in the Net Fishing project promoted three years ago. ""We already know that it is a job that perhaps would not be our responsibility but that we must do it to save our means of living, which is fishing and going to the sea,"" Brull insisted.",usanews.net,news,USANews Press Release Network,,-0.09019607843137256,448833434,1,https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/03/_1c403.png,

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Dan Rotta, 77, of Aventura, was indicted Thursday on charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and lying to the IRS after his release from a federal lock-up this week on a $15 million bond. His bail was granted last week by a magistrate judge after Justice Department attorneys pushed for his pre-trial detention following his arrest at Miami International Airport this month.

Rotta, a Romanian native with citizenship in the United States and Brazil, was indicted along with a close Brazilian friend, Sergio Cernea, of Sao Paolo, who has not been arrested. Cernea is accused with Rotta of conspiring to defraud the United States by helping the wealthy businessman hide $20 million in various Swiss banks to avoid paying income taxes on those assets.

Rotta plans to enter a plea of not guilty through his defense attorney at an arraignment scheduled for Monday in Miami federal court, but he waived his appearance through a court filing this week. His defense attorneys said Rotta plans to fight the charges, noting that he had made a good-faith effort to work with the IRS over the massive income-tax dispute.

""These are complex issues and this is someone that participated in the voluntary disclosure program -- only to get tossed out by the IRS,"" Rotta's Greenberg Traurig lawyers, Jed Dwyer, Ben Katz and Emiley Pagrabs, said in a statement. ""Thousands of folks got a clean slate from the IRS for doing the same that the government alleges against Mr. Rotta. Mr. Rotta looks forward to his day in court.""

Rotta, who formerly lived on Fisher Island off Miami Beach, made his money as president of a New York City company that imported Seiko watches through the ""gray market"" and sold them at a discount in the United States. According to the indictment, he is accused of hiding more than $20 million in assets in 24 secret accounts at five Swiss banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer, and failing to report substantial income from these holdings on his tax returns.

Justice Department prosecutors said at his detention hearing last week that Rotta owes $26 million in taxes, interest and penalties dating back to 2001 and has $38.5 million in assets, which are now mostly held in U.S. bank accounts and real estate properties.

Rotta, who was arrested March 9 at Miami International Airport before a planned flight to Spain, was granted a $15 million bond by a federal magistrate judge. But his bail came with heavy financial conditions, including a $3 million cash deposit and an agreement to transfer several Florida and New York properties valued at $9 million to the U.S. government if he fails to appear for trial.

Rotta, the father of two grown sons and a daughter, also must be confined to his home, surrender his passports and wear an electronic ankle bracelet.

Magistrate Judge Jared Strauss stopped short of granting a request by prosecutors to detain Rotta after they argued he was a flight risk. Rotta, who speaks six languages, also owns two luxury apartments in Barcelona.

""He's a man of the world,"" Justice Department attorney Sean Beaty said at Rotta's detention hearing. ""There is nothing truly tying him to Miami anymore.""

Despite coming up short, the Justice Department chose not to appeal the judge's order allowing Rotta to be released from the Federal Detention Center.

In the indictment, the department's tax attorneys portrayed Rotta as a perennial tax dodger.

Prosecutors said that from 2001 to 2017, Rotta falsely told banks that he was a Brazilian citizen residing in Brazil, when he had been a naturalized U.S. citizen living in this country since the 1970s. Rotta and one of his companies received millions of dollars in transfers from his secret Swiss accounts, according to the indictment.

In 2008, after UBS and its bankers came under criminal investigation for helping U.S. taxpayers evade paying their taxes, Rotta tried to hide his holdings by shutting down his account with that bank and moving his funds to Credit Suisse and other Swiss banks, including putting the accounts in the names of other people, the indictment says.

Three years later, the IRS began auditing Rotta after obtaining evidence of unreported foreign financial accounts. At the time, Rotta falsely denied holding such accounts, but IRS investigators uncovered evidence showing Rotta received transfers of hundreds of thousands of dollars from these foreign accounts that he did not report on his tax returns, prosecutors said.

Rotta is accused of claiming the transfers were non-taxable loans from third parties, and that a representative of the businessman provided the IRS with ""sham loan documents to corroborate his claims,"" prosecutors said. To back up his claim, Rotta enlisted his friend, Cernea, the Brazilian, to inform the IRS that he either made or facilitated the loans.

IRS investigators did not believe Rotta and assessed additional taxes as well as penalties and interest against him, prosecutors said. But then in U.S. Tax Court, Rotta filed a petition that ""falsely denied having any foreign accounts and attached the fictitious loan documents,"" according to a Justice Department news release summarizing a previous criminal complaint for his arrest.

In addition, Rotta's friend, Cernea, traveled to the United States and retold the false loan story to IRS attorneys, prosecutors said. In 2017, after Rotta offered evidence showing that the purported loans had been repaid, the IRS reversed its earlier decision and agreed that Rotta owed no additional tax. Unbeknownst to the IRS, however, the funds that Rotta purportedly repaid to the third parties went into accounts under his control, prosecutors said,

Aware that the IRS would receive copies of his Swiss bank records, Rotta tried to participate in the IRS's voluntary disclosure practice two years later. Taxpayers who willfully do not comply with their tax and reporting obligations can make complete disclosures of their conduct as a possible way to resolve their dispute and limit their potential criminal liability, prosecutors said.

In his submission, which was signed under penalties of perjury, Rotta made several false statements, according to the new indictment.

Rotta, if convicted, faces a maximum penalty of five years for each of the following charges: conspiracy, tax evasion, failing to file a report of bank and financial accounts, and making false statements. He also faces up to three years on charges of filing false tax returns. Cernea, if extradited from Brazil and convicted on the sole conspiracy charges, also faces up to five my years in prison.

During his longstanding tax dispute, Rotta had another run-in with law enforcement.

In 2013, Rotta was found guilty of contempt of court for marrying off his teenage son. That July, a Miami-Dade circuit judge sentenced Rotta to 180 days in jail for allowing his 16-year-old son to get hitched in Las Vegas to his housekeeper's daughter.

The court had ordered Rotta, then 66, to take his troubled son to a Utah boarding school. Instead, Rotta took his son to Las Vegas for the shotgun wedding, which ""emancipated"" the teen from the judge's oversight.

The drama was part of long-running legal disputes stemming from divorce proceedings between Rotta and ex-wife Renee Rotta of Aventura.

Rotta only served nine days in jail before posting a $10,000 bond during his appeal.",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.08235294117647063,448833347,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/8aeed2a1d92e6c4e9b7d7299c3b4adcd,

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said.

The superseding indictment names Loloee and his supermarket general manager, Karla Montoya, who were both charged in the original indictment in December.

The new indictment adds charges against Mirwais Shams, Viva Supermarket's controller and financial auditor, and Ahmad ""Shah"" Shams, the firm's human resources director.

Loloee faces new charges of conspiracy to defraud the IRS, willful failure to collect or pay over withheld taxes, three counts of filing a false tax return and three counts of money laundering.

The new indictment also charges Loloee with three counts of money laundering fraudulently obtained COVID-19 pandemic relief funds.

U.S. Attorney Phil Talbert's office said those charges stem from May 2021, when ""Loloee fraudulently applied for $2.2 million in COVID-19 relief from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program (RRF) and received $1.2 million.""

""After receiving the $1.2 million, Loloee initiated the laundering of funds with 10 checks all bearing the same issue date of June 18, 2021, moving the money through multiple accounts that he controlled,"" Talbert's office said. ""Loloee completed the laundering with three bank transfers that moved $949,900 into a trust account in the name of one of his family members.""

The December indictment accused Loloee and Montoya with conspiracy, obstruction of agency proceedings, and possession and use of false immigration documents in a case alleging they hired employees who were using false immigration papers.

The new indictment adds allegations that Loloee, Mirwais Shams and Ahmad Shams manipulated the working hours reported by Viva employees ""to lower Loloee's on-the-books payroll, to lower the expense of overtime, to lower Loloee's federal payroll tax obligation and to lower Loloee's labor costs overall.""

The indictment charges that Loloee and the others used a system called TimeClock Plus to report hours worked to Heartland payroll.

The time clock system was designed to let employers override the data employees entered into their time clock system, a feature that was supposed to be used to correct time cards if a worker forgot to punch out after a shift or to punch in after a lunch break, the indictment says, but Loloee found a way to use it benefit himself.

""Beginning at least in or about November 2017, M. Shams and S. Shams, working at the direction of Loloee, used the manual override option offered by TimeClock Plus to reduce hours of Viva supermarkets employees, and to delete employees from punch clock records all together,"" the new indictment states.

""The shaving down of hours and deleting employees had at least two purposes: (1) to deprive employees of overtime pay they would be entitled to if their true number of hours were reported to Heartland Payroll, thus enriching Loloee, who kept the proceeds of any unpaid overtime; and (2) to deprive the IRS of the payroll tax obligation that Loloee would bear if the true hours were reported to Heartland Payroll.""

The indictment says Loloee also was able ""to entirely delete certain employees, typically employees who were also undocumented, from the payroll.""

This allowed Loloee to ""avoid scrutiny and any reporting requirements caused by his continued employment of undocumented workers,"" the indictment says, and let him avoid paying workers overtime they were owed. The scheme also allowed Loloee ""to lower his federal payroll tax obligation,"" the indictment says.

All four defendants were scheduled to appear in federal court Friday afternoon on the charges.

Loloee and Montoya have pleaded not guilty to the charges in the original indictment, and Loloee's lawyers previously sought dismissal of much of the original 25-count indictment, arguing that many of the charges stem from years-old allegations and are a ""thinly-veiled end-run around the statute of limitations.""",ca.news.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.08235294117647063,448833291,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/sacramento_bee_mcclatchy_569/0cf35dd2fb2720ad9b09b36774ef17ec,

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote.

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

In Arizona, a projected $1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8%, or about $1.9 billion, last year compared with 2022, but up 26% from 2019.

Tax cuts may be ""coming home to roost"" for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic, slowing states' ability to improve things such as schools and housing, said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID-19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax,"" Tharpe said. ""In several states the reductions are really, genuinely historic like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia. It's not only that states might have to cut services, when they cut taxes this deeply -- it's also that they're forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.""

But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more high-income workers.

""Most states which cut taxes found ways to deliver responsible, sustainable tax relief,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the pro-business The Tax Foundation. ""Tax competition matters more than ever, and if you're balancing a budget, you'd much rather be dealing with the tax-cutting Mountain West than some of the tax-hiking states on the coasts right now.""

Utah and Iowa also had double-digit state tax revenue decreases.

Falling oil prices in 2023 hurt some states. Alaska had the largest percentage drop in state tax revenue last year: 50%, or $2.1 billion, though the state expects a boost this year from higher oil prices, and state tax revenues are still 32% higher than in 2019.

Maryland, which -- like California -- is unusually dependent on income tax revenue from high earners, is facing political battles over whether to cut spending or raise taxes in light of continuing tax revenue disappointments that created a $500 million deficit in the proposed budget.

States got used to having their revenue and giving it back, too, as most states were able to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time because of stimulus funding, a booming economy and consumer spending that boosted tax collections. Now decisions are getting harder as consumers tighten their wallets, tax cuts take effect, stimulus spending is over, and some sources of high-income jobs such as energy and tech have fallen back to earth.

One worrisome new trend in late 2023 continuing to this year: lower sales tax revenue as consumers spend less on retail items, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

""This is alarming,"" Dadayan said. ""The two holiday months, November and December, saw declines in sales tax, indicating that consumers are tightening their wallets.""

Texas reported a 2% drop in March sales tax revenue distributed to local governments based on January sales, and Arizona retail sales tax revenue grew by only 1% in January, the lowest growth in a decade. Maryland is considering expanding its sales tax to more services in light of a retail slump.

The puzzling sales tax dip is especially hard on small towns that depend on it to pay for basic services such as police and firefighters. Sales tax revenues make up more than 43% of the budget for Greenwood, Arkansas, a city of about 9,600 near the Oklahoma border. Sales taxes are about flat so far this year instead of growing 4.5% as forecast, said Finance Director Thomas Marsh.

Greenwood's sales tax revenue soared 50% during the pandemic as big-box stores and restaurants in the nearby city of Fort Smith closed and residents did their shopping and eating out closer to home or online -- an Arkansas state law required local sales tax for online purchases starting in 2019. City officials expected growth to slow, but they were caught off guard when growth stopped in January and February, which could force a hiring freeze and postpone building projects if the situation continues, Marsh said.

David Thurman, director of Tennessee's Budget Analyst Agency and president-elect of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said Tennessee and other states need to take a step back on ambitious programs for a ""reset year"" while taxes drift back to pre-pandemic growth levels.

""We've structured the [fiscal] 2025 budget to allow taking care of the normal cost of government but do very little else,"" Thurman said.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4%, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28%, though, higher than the inflation rate of about 18% in that time.

California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss, even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined $56 billion in state tax revenue, the bulk of the $66 billion national loss.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to $73 billion, called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes, including a proposed $1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for low-income people regardless of immigration status.

Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion, which would include $4 billion in state funds, ""money we don't have"" for ""illegal immigrants"" in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber, who is also a San Diego physician, said the expansion would mean ""we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.""

The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes, which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction, homeless housing, broadband or transit funding.

Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Stateline analysis.

Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee's $140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools.

Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee's voucher plan includes an extra $320 million for public school funding in rural areas, staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs -- spending the state can't afford given its $400 million budget deficit, he said.

Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle: In New Jersey, where state tax revenue dropped 4% last year but remains 32% higher than 2019, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about $1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people.

Dan Rotta, 77, of Aventura, was indicted Thursday on charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and lying to the IRS after his release from a federal lock-up this week on a $15 million bond. His bail was granted last week by a magistrate judge after Justice Department attorneys pushed for his pre-trial detention following his arrest at Miami International Airport this month.

Rotta, a Romanian native with citizenship in the United States and Brazil, was indicted along with a close Brazilian friend, Sergio Cernea, of Sao Paolo, who has not been arrested. Cernea is accused with Rotta of conspiring to defraud the United States by helping the wealthy businessman hide $20 million in various Swiss banks to avoid paying income taxes on those assets.

Rotta plans to enter a plea of not guilty through his defense attorney at an arraignment scheduled for Monday in Miami federal court, but he waived his appearance through a court filing this week. His defense attorneys said Rotta plans to fight the charges, noting that he had made a good-faith effort to work with the IRS over the massive income-tax dispute.

""These are complex issues and this is someone that participated in the voluntary disclosure program -- only to get tossed out by the IRS,"" Rotta's Greenberg Traurig lawyers, Jed Dwyer, Ben Katz and Emiley Pagrabs, said in a statement. ""Thousands of folks got a clean slate from the IRS for doing the same that the government alleges against Mr. Rotta. Mr. Rotta looks forward to his day in court.""

Rotta, who formerly lived on Fisher Island off Miami Beach, made his money as president of a New York City company that imported Seiko watches through the ""gray market"" and sold them at a discount in the United States. According to the indictment, he is accused of hiding more than $20 million in assets in 24 secret accounts at five Swiss banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer, and failing to report substantial income from these holdings on his tax returns.

Justice Department prosecutors said at his detention hearing last week that Rotta owes $26 million in taxes, interest and penalties dating back to 2001 and has $38.5 million in assets, which are now mostly held in U.S. bank accounts and real estate properties.

Rotta, who was arrested March 9 at Miami International Airport before a planned flight to Spain, was granted a $15 million bond by a federal magistrate judge. But his bail came with heavy financial conditions, including a $3 million cash deposit and an agreement to transfer several Florida and New York properties valued at $9 million to the U.S. government if he fails to appear for trial.

Rotta, the father of two grown sons and a daughter, also must be confined to his home, surrender his passports and wear an electronic ankle bracelet.

Magistrate Judge Jared Strauss stopped short of granting a request by prosecutors to detain Rotta after they argued he was a flight risk. Rotta, who speaks six languages, also owns two luxury apartments in Barcelona.

""He's a man of the world,"" Justice Department attorney Sean Beaty said at Rotta's detention hearing. ""There is nothing truly tying him to Miami anymore.""

Despite coming up short, the Justice Department chose not to appeal the judge's order allowing Rotta to be released from the Federal Detention Center.

In the indictment, the department's tax attorneys portrayed Rotta as a perennial tax dodger.

Prosecutors said that from 2001 to 2017, Rotta falsely told banks that he was a Brazilian citizen residing in Brazil, when he had been a naturalized U.S. citizen living in this country since the 1970s. Rotta and one of his companies received millions of dollars in transfers from his secret Swiss accounts, according to the indictment.

In 2008, after UBS and its bankers came under criminal investigation for helping U.S. taxpayers evade paying their taxes, Rotta tried to hide his holdings by shutting down his account with that bank and moving his funds to Credit Suisse and other Swiss banks, including putting the accounts in the names of other people, the indictment says.

Three years later, the IRS began auditing Rotta after obtaining evidence of unreported foreign financial accounts. At the time, Rotta falsely denied holding such accounts, but IRS investigators uncovered evidence showing Rotta received transfers of hundreds of thousands of dollars from these foreign accounts that he did not report on his tax returns, prosecutors said.

Rotta is accused of claiming the transfers were non-taxable loans from third parties, and that a representative of the businessman provided the IRS with ""sham loan documents to corroborate his claims,"" prosecutors said. To back up his claim, Rotta enlisted his friend, Cernea, the Brazilian, to inform the IRS that he either made or facilitated the loans.

IRS investigators did not believe Rotta and assessed additional taxes as well as penalties and interest against him, prosecutors said. But then in U.S. Tax Court, Rotta filed a petition that ""falsely denied having any foreign accounts and attached the fictitious loan documents,"" according to a Justice Department news release summarizing a previous criminal complaint for his arrest.

In addition, Rotta's friend, Cernea, traveled to the United States and retold the false loan story to IRS attorneys, prosecutors said. In 2017, after Rotta offered evidence showing that the purported loans had been repaid, the IRS reversed its earlier decision and agreed that Rotta owed no additional tax. Unbeknownst to the IRS, however, the funds that Rotta purportedly repaid to the third parties went into accounts under his control, prosecutors said,

Aware that the IRS would receive copies of his Swiss bank records, Rotta tried to participate in the IRS's voluntary disclosure practice two years later. Taxpayers who willfully do not comply with their tax and reporting obligations can make complete disclosures of their conduct as a possible way to resolve their dispute and limit their potential criminal liability, prosecutors said.

In his submission, which was signed under penalties of perjury, Rotta made several false statements, according to the new indictment.

Rotta, if convicted, faces a maximum penalty of five years for each of the following charges: conspiracy, tax evasion, failing to file a report of bank and financial accounts, and making false statements. He also faces up to three years on charges of filing false tax returns. Cernea, if extradited from Brazil and convicted on the sole conspiracy charges, also faces up to five my years in prison.

During his longstanding tax dispute, Rotta had another run-in with law enforcement.

In 2013, Rotta was found guilty of contempt of court for marrying off his teenage son. That July, a Miami-Dade circuit judge sentenced Rotta to 180 days in jail for allowing his 16-year-old son to get hitched in Las Vegas to his housekeeper's daughter.

The court had ordered Rotta, then 66, to take his troubled son to a Utah boarding school. Instead, Rotta took his son to Las Vegas for the shotgun wedding, which ""emancipated"" the teen from the judge's oversight.

The drama was part of long-running legal disputes stemming from divorce proceedings between Rotta and ex-wife Renee Rotta of Aventura.

Right Proper Brewing Company has two locations and is working to expand to a third.

But like so many other small businesses during the pandemic, there was a time when its future seemed uncertain.

""When the city shut down, we lost 60 percent of our revenue overnight,"" said Cheston. ""That's because 60 percent of our revenue was coming from the sale of draft beer to bars and restaurants, and so when the restaurants and bars closed, we lost all of that revenue.""

That's why there's now a proposal in Congress aimed at helping these small businesses as they work to recover from the pandemic.

The Creating Hospitality Economic Enhancement for Restaurants and Servers (CHEERS) Act would give tax breaks to businesses that use energy efficient draft lines and keg equipment.

It has bipartisan support in the House.

""Many of our local businesses and the hospitality sector at-large are still facing economic challenges,"" said Rep. Darin LaHood (R-IL), a sponsor of the bill. ""This bipartisan bill will support these local establishments by incentivizing the expansion of tap lines and keg equipment on commercial premises.""

""The CHEERS Act would boost not only our smaller bars, clubs, and entertainment venues but also many of our casinos, hotels, and arenas,"" said Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), another sponsor of the bill. ""This will allow many small business owners in my district to grow their business and invest more in their employees.""

We asked Cheston about the impact this measure would have on his business.

""It would be tremendous,"" said Cheston. ""It's really important for our business model to be able to service draft beer.""

Even though a lot of business has returned for craft brewers, they're still feeling the hit from the pandemic - especially when it comes to draft beer sales.

""Draft for example is still down 25 percent roughly since its pre-pandemic levels,"" said Marc Sorini, General Counsel for the Brewers Association. ""So that is a very, very difficult thing to overcome.""

The Brewers Association represents more than 5,400 brewers, craft beer retailers, and more.

""The primary beneficiaries are going to be bars and restaurants. We want bars and restaurants to be installing more tap equipment, selling more draft beer because draft is very good for craft,"" said Sorini. ""We think [the CHEERS Act] is going to be very, very good for our members if it passes.""

Draft beer is often sold in reusable kegs, so they hold a lot more beer compared to bottles and cans, and it means lower production costs because packaging and shipping is much easier.

""From production to consumption, draft beer is much more energy efficient,"" said Cheston.

The brewery industry is urging Congress to act fast to pass the CHEERS Act.

""It's good for the economy as a whole,"" said Cheston. ""It's absolutely huge for the industry.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,0.223529411764706,448833010,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/wpxi_cox_articles_540/695a0a6c083c4efa0c667831d931747f,eng-9414106

However, BofA strategists argue if UST yields 10 years and out rise as expected, muni-UST ratios should ""rise some from record low levels as well, but should still prove quite resilient.""

BofA strategists said ""both the muni AAA curve and muni ratio curve should have some bear flattening while Treasuries steepen for the next several week.""

Elsewhere, in the taxable space, Build America Bonds and extraordinary redemption provisions unsurprisingly remain the ""topic du jour,"" said Barclays strategists.

The most recent developments include asking the Regents of the University of California to either cancel the recent ERP $1.1 billion refunding or use make-whole call to exercise this call and investors scrutinizing a .

For the former, legal actions could follow if the issuer does not abide by the requests.

""Other issuers that either exercised their ERP calls already or are intending to exercise them in the near future could potentially receive similar letters,"" Barclays strategists said.

While several other issuers have decided to call their BABs through an ERP, they said ""this development will likely give a bit of a pause to issuers that were intending to exercise their calls.""

BAB spreads have ""continued underperforming,"" but in the near term recent developments could support them, they said.

Separately, Barclays strategists noted, that the market might see ""tax-exempts issued recently to take out BABs via ERPs start trading at a bit of discount due to this legal uncertainty.""

The superseding indictment names Loloee and his supermarket general manager, Karla Montoya, who were both charged in the original indictment in December.

The new indictment adds charges against Mirwais Shams, Viva Supermarket's controller and financial auditor, and Ahmad ""Shah"" Shams, the firm's human resources director.

Loloee faces new charges of conspiracy to defraud the IRS, willful failure to collect or pay over withheld taxes, three counts of filing a false tax return and three counts of money laundering.

The new indictment also charges Loloee with three counts of money laundering fraudulently obtained COVID-19 pandemic relief funds

The December indictment accused Loloee and Montoya with conspiracy, obstruction of agency proceedings, and possession and use of false immigration documents in a case alleging they hired employees who were using false immigration papers.

The new indictment adds allegations that Loloee, Mirwais Shams and Ahmad Shams manipulated the working hours reported by Viva employees ""to lower Loloee's on-the-books payroll, to lower the expense of overtime, to lower Loloee's federal payroll tax obligation and to lower Loloee's labor costs overall.""

The indictment charges that Loloee and the others used a system called TimeClock Plus to report hours worked to Heartland payroll.

The time clock system was designed to let employers override the data employees entered into their time clock system, a feature that was supposed to be used to correct time cards if a worker forgot to punch out after a shift or to punch in after a lunch break, the indictment says, but Loloee found a way to use it benefit himself.

""Beginning at least in or about November 2017, M. Shams and S. Shams, working at the direction of Loloee, used the manual override option offered by TimeClock Plus to reduce hours of Viva supermarkets employees, and to delete employees from punch clock records all together,"" the new indictment states.

""The shaving down of hours and deleting employees had at least two purposes: (1) to deprive employees of overtime pay they would be entitled to if their true number of hours were reported to Heartland Payroll, thus enriching Loloee, who kept the proceeds of any unpaid overtime; and (2) to deprive the IRS of the payroll tax obligation that Loloee would bear if the true hours were reported to Heartland Payroll.""

The indictment says Loloee also was able ""to entirely delete certain employees, typically employees who were also undocumented, from the payroll.""

This allowed Loloee to ""avoid scrutiny and any reporting requirements caused by his continued employment of undocumented workers,"" the indictment says, and let him avoid paying workers overtime they were owed. The scheme also allowed Loloee ""to lower his federal payroll tax obligation,"" the indictment says.

All four defendants were scheduled to appear in federal court Friday afternoon on the charges.

Loloee and Montoya have pleaded not guilty to the charges in the original indictment, and Loloee's lawyers previously sought dismissal of much of the original 25-count indictment, arguing that many of the charges stem from years-old allegations and are a ""thinly-veiled end-run around the statute of limitations.""",yahoo.com,news,Yahoo,,-0.4901960784313726,448832802,1,https://media.zenfs.com/en/sacramento_bee_mcclatchy_569/0cf35dd2fb2720ad9b09b36774ef17ec,

Assemblyman Charles Lavine introduced a bill that would throw out the law, which was enacted in 1907 in an effort to curb the number of divorces, the Associated Press reported. At the time, adultery was the only reason to authorize a divorce. Currently, the law makes adultery in the state a misdemeanor that can be punishable by up to three months in jail.

""This outdated statute criminalizes sexual behavior between consenting adults,"" Lavine said in a press release. ""It is long past time for us to remove it from the penal code. If a law is not enforced, there is no reason it should be maintained.""

Since 1972, only 13 people have been charged under the rarely used law, Lavine added, and of those charges, only five were ever convicted of the crime.

The law was nearly repealed in the 1960s, but when the changes were passed by the Assembly, a lawmaker from the chamber decided not to approve the changes due to concerns that it would appear as if the state was encouraging infidelity, according to a New York Times article.

Divorce on the basis of adultery can be challenging for a spouse to prove, as one cannot rely on just suspicion and would have to provide circumstantial evidence to the court.

New York is the latest state that is attempting to repeal such a law. States that already have done so include Colorado, New Hampshire, Idaho, and Utah. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Oklahoma all classify adultery as a felony offense.

Lavine's bill was overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly in a 137-10 vote, and it is headed to the state Senate, where it is likely to be passed before being signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY).

The committee, chaired by Majority Leader Peter Jateso Imwatok, said it was in the process of finalising its report only to receive crucial feedback from some parties who were summoned but failed to appear.

While seeking the extension, Mr Imwatok said the committee had received an email report from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) with a breakdown of its operations on the Nairobi Revenue System (NRS).

""Mr Speaker, I beg your indulgence to request for the last time to allow the tabling of this report on the second Tuesday of April 2024,"" Mr Imwatok said.

The committee was due to present its final report to the House on March 19, following the first extension granted after the chairman asked for 45 days to complete the task.

Mr Imwatok, who represents residents of Makongeni Ward, said from what they had gathered so far, the revenue system was complicated and no one knew who was operating it, resulting in millions of dollars being lost daily.

""We had found out that in the last two years, they had lost Sh2.9 billion in revenue collection. That is why they had emailed a huge document for our officials to download.""

Assembly Speaker Kennedy Ng'ondi granted the committee the extension, saying it was the last one.

The committee has been in place since November 2023 to gather information on the dwindling revenue in the county since the introduction of the NRS system.

The committee's mandate expired on 3 January 2024, and it was expected to submit a comprehensive report on the poor revenue collection in the capital.

However, the failure of key witnesses to appear before the committee has hampered the ongoing investigation.

Former NMS director-general Lieutenant-General Mohamed Badi failed to appear, as did the head of the civil service, Felix Koskei, and the interior ministry.

In his recent address to the media, the chairman of the committee had said that the report was at an advanced stage and would be submitted with or without the testimony of those who failed to appear.

The ongoing inquiry has faced a number of challenges, including divisions from some members who felt that nothing special was expected.

The partnership will see KRA develop exclusive tax e-resources for students in the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), a significant step in simplifying tax concepts and integrating tax education into mainstream learning.

Under the partnership, signed on Tuesday, March 19, the authority will develop specialised digital resources focusing on key subjects such as economics, mathematics, English, Kiswahili and social studies.

KRA Commissioner General Humphrey Wattanga said such resources would provide students with a basic understanding of taxation, its purpose and its impact on individuals and society.

Mr Wattanga also stated that the agreement will highlight the importance of introducing tax education at an early age, which he believes will have a significant direct impact on individuals and society.

""By learning about taxes at an early age, students become more informed and responsible citizens, contributing to a long-term shift towards a society that values a fair and efficient tax system,"" Mr Wattanga said.

The Commissioner General also emphasised that the integration of tax education content into school curricula simplifies complex tax issues, which is key to changing the culture of paying taxes in the country.

The Commissioner General expressed optimism that the initiative will foster a sense of responsibility towards the tax system, ultimately leading to higher compliance rates.

During the meeting, TVET Senior Deputy Director Dr Samuel Obudho underscored the significant impact of working with the authority.

""This partnership provides an efficient platform for the KRA to reach out to a wide audience,"" said Dr Obudho.

Dr Obudho emphasised that KICD will work closely with KRA to develop up-to-date digital content on tax literacy with simulation environments to positively influence learners' perceptions and attitudes towards taxes.

The partnership will start with primary and secondary school students and progress to tertiary education, targeting potential taxpayers.

The initiative aims to engage the general public, whose role in tax matters is significant.

The Canada Revenue Agency says Festus Bayden, of Brampton, Ont., was a partner in a tax preparation business known as E & F Tax Associates or as Bankay Financial Services Inc. in Toronto and later in Brampton.

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

""These promoters deliberately make false statements to assist their clients in avoiding or evading tax,"" the Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement.

""As a result, they obtain a financial benefit from the fees they receive from their clients. To maintain the fairness of our tax system, the CRA holds both those promoters who facilitate tax evasion, as well as those who use their services to evade taxes, accountable for their actions.""

In February 2023, PMI CEO Jacek Olczak told The Financial Times that negotiations on the exit 'stalled' as the company does not want to sell the business 'on unfavourable terms for shareholders'. Meanwhile, PMI retains tax preferences for conducting business in Ukraine.

In Ukraine, Philip Morris International is officially recognized as an international sponsor of the war - it was included in the relevant list of the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) in 2023 - after the Russian PMI unit reported that the company's net profit in the first year of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine increased to 48.2 billion rubles (45% more than in 2021), and the corporate tax in the Russian budget was paid in the amount of more than $136 million.

Over the past three years, Philip Morris International in Russia has steadily increased its revenue and is in the top 5 foreign companies paying taxes to the Russian budget. In 2021, Philip Morris' revenue was 359.53 billion rubles, in the first 'war' year it increased to 392.9 billion rubles, and in 2023, the company reportedreceiving 399.9 billion rubles.

Despite these indicators, which should have alerted the Ukrainian government seeking new sources of income during the war with Russia, Philip Morris International enjoys a preferential ad valorem tax rate in Ukraine, which does not exist in any other country - 12%.

Ukrainian journalist Denis Bezlyudko drew attention to the paradoxical situation with the use of tax preferences by the international company PMI in Ukraine.

According to the investigator's data, until 2013, the ad valorem tax rate on cigarettes in Ukraine was 25%.

As Ukrainian media reported, in 2013, there was a monopolization by international tobacco companies not only in the sphere of cigarette production, but also in their distribution - Philip Morris International and JTI acquired 20% each inequity interest of the Russian distributor company Megapolis, which owned the Ukrainian subsidiary company-monopolist Megapolis-Ukraine (subsequently, the Ukrainian company was renamed to Tedis).

Parallel to the market monopolization (still under President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government was accused of massive corruption), the ad valorem tax rate was reduced to 12%, providing PMI with additional income.

Paradoxically, the rate remains at this level to this day - against the growing state budget deficit.

""The situation has been cemented. Legislations that could raise this rate are simply not put to the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament - ed.).

In Europe, which we like to compare ourselves to, ad valorem tax rates on cigarettes, for the most part, range from 25% to 50% (in some countries even higher). According to experts' estimates, over 11 years of the reduced rate, the Ukrainian budget lost about 100 billion hryvnias"", - writes Bezlyudko.

Despite the fact that the Ukrainian government, against the backdrop of the cessation of assistance from the United States, is looking for new sources of budget replenishment and cost reduction, the issue of taxation for remaining international companies in Russia is not being discussed in Parliament and society. The same ad valorem tax rate within the price of cigarettes is paid by both those who buy premium products and those who smoke ""Vatra"" (Ukrainian cigarette products in the cheaper price segment).

""In Russia itself, the ad valorem tax rate is 16% [...] In the vast majority of EU countries, ad valorem tax rates are significantly higher and sometimes reach 50%. In other words, a wealthy smoker who smokes expensive premium cigarettes pays more tax than a smoker of cheaper cigarettes.

""And we have equalized taxes on Prima and Marlboro"", - believes the director of the Ukrainian Center for Civil Society Studies, political scientist Vitaly Kulik. - ""The difference is that Prima is of domestic production and does not operate in Russia, while the manufacturer of the Marlboro brand, Philip Morris, still finances the Russian army, killing Ukrainians"".

The Ukrainian expert community proposes, at most, to introduce restrictions for tobacco companies that have not yet left Russia, and at least - to increase the ad valorem tax rate for brands that these companies sell in Ukraine.

The problem of international companies that have remained in the Russian market has also been faced by European countries.

The case of Estonia is interesting. Here,in March, the Minister of Defence issued an order prohibiting the trade of products from companies that have not exited the Russian market, including Philip Morris International, in departmental institutions. The minister uses the List of international war sponsors from the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention for this.",eutoday.net,news,eutoday.net,EUToday Correspondents,-0.0117647058823529,448832454,1,https://i0.wp.com/eutoday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Philip_Morris_Izhora_factory-scaled.jpg,

This week, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee advanced legislation that prevents Coast Guard Academy cadets from punishment when reporting an incident of sexual assault, language which was proposed last year by Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Ranking Member Salud Carbajal (CA-24) and Rep. Joe Courtney (CT-2).

The provision passed 53-3 as part of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2024.

The bill advanced by the committee also includes language proposed by Ranking Member Carbajal and Subcommittee Chair Daniel Webster (R-FL) to strengthen sexual assault and harassment protections for members of the Coast Guard and ensures greater accountability and transparency in the Coast Guard following the Committee's investigation of the Service's Operation Fouled Anchor.

""Every single day, the Coast Guard goes to work on the broad range of missions that keep our nation and its citizens safe. They mind the safety of our seas and the security of our waters, protect our seafarers and our beachgoers, and reinforce our national defense,"" said Ranking Member Carbajal. ""As a veteran and the top Democrat on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, I'm proud to build on our previous actions taken to protect our servicemembers doing these critical missions by advancing bipartisan legislation aimed at holding the Coast Guard accountable for reforms needed to eliminate sexual assault and sexual harassments from its ranks.""

""I've worked over the last decade to institute safeguards to prevent and address sexual assault across the Coast Guard -- a serious issue that was brought to light because of the courageous cadets and faculty who brought this to my office's attention in 2018. Committee passage of the safe to report policy marks a significant step forward by Congress and the Coast Guard to provide greater protections for military personnel reporting sexual assault and codifies protections that students have at all other military academies. I commend Commandant Fagan for adopting this policy even before Congress acted and her ongoing commitment to supporting and protecting all Coast Guard personnel,"" said Rep. Joe Courtney. ""I applaud Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leadership, Chairmen Graves (R-MO) and Webster (R-FL), and Ranking Members Larsen (D-WA) and Carbajal (D-CA), for their leadership in working with me to advance this important provision through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.""

""As the demands on the Coast Guard continue to grow, we must increase our commitment to the servicemembers who carry out its critical missions,"" Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Rick Larsen (D-WA) said. ""The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2024 includes important provisions that will better protect servicemembers and fight sexual violence by holding the Coast Guard accountable for its sexual assault and harassment mitigation and prevention efforts. I commend the advocacy of Representatives Carbajal and Courtney to advance these important protections for Coasties.""

""The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2024 provides the necessary investments and authorities required to maintain the Coast Guard's critical missions. These investments are especially important to ensure border security given the increase in interdiction and repatriations of those illegally attempting to land on Florida shores. The measure will also help turn the tide on the Service's recruiting challenges and provides for additional surface and air assets, as well as resources to begin replacing the Service's crumbling shoreside infrastructure,"" said Subcommittee Chairman Webster. ""Following the troubling revelations of Operation Fouled Anchor, this legislation incorporates the Coast Guard Protection and Accountability Act of 2024 that Ranking Member Carbajal and I introduced, along with Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, which strengthens protections for members of the Coast Guard from sexual assault and harassment and increases transparency within the Service. I appreciate Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Carbajal for their work in passing this important bipartisan legislation out of Committee.""

The Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act required the Department of Defense to implement Safe-to-Report policy for collateral misconduct involving a midshipman or cadet who is the victim of an alleged sexual assault at Department of Defense Military Academies, which does not include the Coast Guard Academies.

In August of 2023, Reps. Carbajal and Courtney introduced legislation to ensure that the Coast Guard Academy implements identical policy to prevent cadets from punishment for minor offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice when reporting an incident of sexual assault. Minor offenses include underage drinking and violating curfew, for example.

In February of 2024, Rep. Carbajal and other members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee introduced the Coast Guard Protection and Accountability Act, which included the Safe-to-Report policy.

The Committee passed the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2024, which included the Coast Guard Protection and Accountability Act, on Wednesday.

Similar Safe-to-Report legislation has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Blumenthal (D-CT) and Murphy (D-CT).",foreignaffairs.co.nz,news,foreignaffairs.co.nz,Mil-Osi Publisher,0.1764705882352942,448832435,1,,eng-9411671

Dan Rotta, 77, of Aventura, was indicted Thursday on charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and lying to the IRS after his release from a federal lock-up this week on a $15 million bond. His bail was granted last week by a magistrate judge after Justice Department attorneys pushed for his pre-trial detention following his arrest at Miami International Airport this month.

Rotta, a Romanian native with citizenship in the United States and Brazil, was indicted along with a close Brazilian friend, Sergio Cernea, of Sao Paolo, who has not been arrested. Cernea is accused with Rotta of conspiring to defraud the United States by helping the wealthy businessman hide $20 million in various Swiss banks to avoid paying income taxes on those assets.

Rotta plans to enter a plea of not guilty through his defense attorney at an arraignment scheduled for Monday in Miami federal court, but he waived his appearance through a court filing this week. His defense attorneys said Rotta plans to fight the charges, noting that he had made a good-faith effort to work with the IRS over the massive income-tax dispute.

""These are complex issues and this is someone that participated in the voluntary disclosure program -- only to get tossed out by the IRS,"" Rotta's Greenberg Traurig lawyers, Jed Dwyer, Ben Katz and Emiley Pagrabs, said in a statement. ""Thousands of folks got a clean slate from the IRS for doing the same that the government alleges against Mr. Rotta. Mr. Rotta looks forward to his day in court.""

How the money was made

Rotta, who formerly lived on Fisher Island off Miami Beach, made his money as president of a New York City company that imported Seiko watches through the ""gray market"" and sold them at a discount in the United States. According to the indictment, he is accused of hiding more than $20 million in assets in 24 secret accounts at five Swiss banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer, and failing to report substantial income from these holdings on his tax returns.

Justice Department prosecutors said at his detention hearing last week that Rotta owes $26 million in taxes, interest and penalties dating back to 2001 and has $38.5 million in assets, which are now mostly held in U.S. bank accounts and real estate properties.

Rotta, who was arrested March 9 at Miami International Airport before a planned flight to Spain, was granted a $15 million bond by a federal magistrate judge. But his bail came with heavy financial conditions, including a $3 million cash deposit and an agreement to transfer several Florida and New York properties valued at $9 million to the U.S. government if he fails to appear for trial.

Rotta, the father of two grown sons and a daughter, also must be confined to his home, surrender his passports and wear an electronic ankle bracelet.

Magistrate Judge Jared Strauss stopped short of granting a request by prosecutors to detain Rotta after they argued he was a flight risk. Rotta, who speaks six languages, also owns two luxury apartments in Barcelona.

""He's a man of the world,"" Justice Department attorney Sean Beaty said at Rotta's detention hearing. ""There is nothing truly tying him to Miami anymore.""

Despite coming up short, the Justice Department chose not to appeal the judge's order allowing Rotta to be released from the Federal Detention Center.

Indictment details

In the indictment, the department's tax attorneys portrayed Rotta as a perennial tax dodger.

Prosecutors said that from 2001 to 2017, Rotta falsely told banks that he was a Brazilian citizen residing in Brazil, when he had been a naturalized U.S. citizen living in this country since the 1970s. Rotta and one of his companies received millions of dollars in transfers from his secret Swiss accounts, according to the indictment.

In 2008, after UBS and its bankers came under criminal investigation for helping U.S. taxpayers evade paying their taxes, Rotta tried to hide his holdings by shutting down his account with that bank and moving his funds to Credit Suisse and other Swiss banks, including putting the accounts in the names of other people, the indictment says.

Three years later, the IRS began auditing Rotta after obtaining evidence of unreported foreign financial accounts. At the time, Rotta falsely denied holding such accounts, but IRS investigators uncovered evidence showing Rotta received transfers of hundreds of thousands of dollars from these foreign accounts that he did not report on his tax returns, prosecutors said.

Rotta is accused of claiming the transfers were non-taxable loans from third parties, and that a representative of the businessman provided the IRS with ""sham loan documents to corroborate his claims,"" prosecutors said. To back up his claim, Rotta enlisted his friend, Cernea, the Brazilian, to inform the IRS that he either made or facilitated the loans.

IRS investigators did not believe Rotta and assessed additional taxes as well as penalties and interest against him, prosecutors said. But then in U.S. Tax Court, Rotta filed a petition that ""falsely denied having any foreign accounts and attached the fictitious loan documents,"" according to a Justice Department news release summarizing a previous criminal complaint for his arrest.

In addition, Rotta's friend, Cernea, traveled to the United States and retold the false loan story to IRS attorneys, prosecutors said. In 2017, after Rotta offered evidence showing that the purported loans had been repaid, the IRS reversed its earlier decision and agreed that Rotta owed no additional tax. Unbeknownst to the IRS, however, the funds that Rotta purportedly repaid to the third parties went into accounts under his control, prosecutors said,

Aware that the IRS would receive copies of his Swiss bank records, Rotta tried to participate in the IRS's voluntary disclosure practice two years later. Taxpayers who willfully do not comply with their tax and reporting obligations can make complete disclosures of their conduct as a possible way to resolve their dispute and limit their potential criminal liability, prosecutors said.

In his submission, which was signed under penalties of perjury, Rotta made several false statements, according to the new indictment.

Possible penalties, other legal issues

Rotta, if convicted, faces a maximum penalty of five years for each of the following charges: conspiracy, tax evasion, failing to file a report of bank and financial accounts, and making false statements. He also faces up to three years on charges of filing false tax returns. Cernea, if extradited from Brazil and convicted on the sole conspiracy charges, also faces up to five my years in prison.

During his longstanding tax dispute, Rotta had another run-in with law enforcement.

In 2013, Rotta was found guilty of contempt of court for marrying off his teenage son. That July, a Miami-Dade circuit judge sentenced Rotta to 180 days in jail for allowing his 16-year-old son to get hitched in Las Vegas to his housekeeper's daughter.

The court had ordered Rotta, then 66, to take his troubled son to a Utah boarding school. Instead, Rotta took his son to Las Vegas for the shotgun wedding, which ""emancipated"" the teen from the judge's oversight.

The drama was part of long-running legal disputes stemming from divorce proceedings between Rotta and ex-wife Renee Rotta of Aventura.

Rotta only served nine days in jail before posting a $10,000 bond during his appeal.",miamiherald.com,news,Miami Herald,Jay Weaver,-0.09019607843137256,448832431,1,https://www.elnuevoherald.com/ultimas-noticias/r9n30f/picture286910230/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/iStock-1154918133.jpg,

The 2024 tax season has been chugging along for over seven weeks now, and there's about a month left until everything wraps up, with the season having kicked off on Jan. 29 and ending April 15. The amount of tax refund money the IRS has sent out is continuing to pick up, even though the total number of refunds sent so far in 2024 is continuing to lag behind the numbers for the same period in 2023.

Taxpayers can normally expect to receive a refund within 21 days if they file electronically and choose direct deposit, the IRS said. But by March 15, the IRS had issued more than 49.1 million refunds. By comparison, the IRS had sent out over 53.9 million refunds by March 17, 2023.

Tax season last year started six days earlier, however, on Jan. 23, so the IRS had nearly a week longer to receive and process tax returns and send refunds. Though, it seems that the agency is beginning to catch, and even surpass, last year's numbers.

Here's how the IRS is doing this year. For more on taxes, check out our essential 2024 tax filing cheat sheet, how to track your refund with the IRS and the best tax software for 2024.

As of March 15, the IRS said it had processed 70.5 million federal income tax returns, down by 1.2% from the 71.4 million it got through this time last year. With tax season starting earlier in 2023 -- Jan. 23 versus Jan. 29 -- filers had six more days last year to send in their tax returns.

The IRS had also received 71.5 million returns by March 15, down by a mere 0.4% from the 71.8 million it received by March 17, 2023.

Of the 71.5 million returns received so far, just over 69.5 million of those were filed electronically, the IRS said -- 34.8 million from professional tax preparers and another 34.6 million from self-preparers.

The IRS has issued more than 49.1 million refunds as of March 15, down by 8.8% from the 53.9 million it had sent out by March 17, 2023.

In the first seven weeks of this tax year, the IRS refunded over $152.7 billion -- down by just 3.4% from the $158 billion sent out by March 17 last year. Again, the 2023 tax season began six days earlier.

The average refund size is up by 6%, from $2,933 for 2023's tax season through March 17, to $3,109 for this season through March 15.

While the average refund size is up so far compared to the same time last year, the IRS told CNET that making year-to-date comparisons can be tricky because of how much earlier it started last year. The agency did say the 2024 tax season is off to a strong start, with all systems running well.

Of those who received refunds, 47.5 million chose direct deposit, and their refund was $3,177. By comparison, for the same time period last year, 50.9 million direct depositors had already received their return, which averaged $3,019.

Ministers of defense and of the interior said the bill was prompted by the war that neighboring Ukraine is fighting against Russia's aggression. Russia has recently captured territory in the east, while Ukraine is running critically low on ammunition.

The legislation will be put before Parliament probably in May, after consultations with the public and with local authorities, ministers said.

""Because of the developments that we can see across our eastern border, we are talking here about extreme situations ..., about an armed conflict,"" said Marcin Kierwiński, minister of the interior and administration.

Poland is one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters on the military and the humanitarian levels and has taken in almost 1.5 million refugees.

Defense minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said they were presenting the bill ""in order to deter, not to frighten anyone, but we must be ready for every potential situation.""

The law will allow Poles, including school children, to go through organized self-defense and first aid courses, starting this year. It also calls for improving Poland's public warning systems and increasing the number and quality of emergency shelters in the coming years.

A recent report by the state Supreme Audit Office said that currently only some 4% of residents in this nation of 38 million would be able to find proper shelter in an emergency.

Amid a public discussion about the scant availability of shelters, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said last week that the city will invest some 117 million zlotys ($30 million) into upgrading existing shelters and adapting other sites for the purpose, as well as providing training for residents.

Warner (D-VA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, introduced the Health Care Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2024, legislation that would allow for advance and accelerated payments to health care providers in the event of a cyber incident, as long as they and their vendors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The legislation follows a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare that has paralyzed billing services for providers nationwide, leaving many in danger of becoming financially insolvent.

""I've been sounding the alarm about cybersecurity in the health care sector for some time. It was only a matter of time before we saw a major attack that disrupted the ability to care for patients nationwide,"" said Sen. Warner. ""The recent hack of Change Healthcare is a reminder that the entire health care industry is vulnerable and needs to step up its game. This legislation would provide some important financial incentives for providers and vendors to do so.""

In rare situations, Medicare Part A providers (such as acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other inpatient care facilities) and Part B suppliers (including physicians, nonphysician practitioners, durable medical equipment suppliers, and others who furnish outpatient services) can face cash flow challenges due to specified circumstances beyond their control (for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic.) Since the 1980s, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided temporary financial relief to participants in these programs through Accelerated and Advance Payment (AAP) programs, during which these providers and suppliers receive advance payments from the federal government that are later recovered by withholding payment for subsequent claims.

The Health Care Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2024 would modify the existing Medicare Hospital Accelerated Payment Program and the Medicare Part B Advance Payment Program by:

These provisions would go into effect two years from the date of enactment. A copy of the bill text is available here.

Warner authored ""Cybersecurity is Patient Safety,"" a policy options paper, outlining current cybersecurity threats facing health care providers and systems and offering for discussion a series of policy solutions to improve cybersecurity across the industry.

The Canada Revenue Agency says Festus Bayden, of Brampton, Ont., was a partner in a tax preparation business known as E & F Tax Associates or as Bankay Financial Services Inc. in Toronto and later in Brampton.

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

In February, the county conducted a survey on residents' opinions about public services as well as their thoughts on the county's capabilities to lead and support the public. The survey results are available to view online. According to a press statement from the county, 2,875 residents responded to the survey.

According the survey, 55% of Arapahoe County residents said they would support a 0.25% sales tax increase, which would cost the average household an extra $52 per year and raise up to $45 million annually.

Half of the residents said they would support a measure to allow the county to retain revenue above TABOR limits -- also known as 'de-Brucing' -- which would cost the owner of a $500,000 home about $155 per year and raise up to $75 million annually.

Commissioners say they are months away from making any decision on potential ballot questions, according to the press statement. However, public input, they said, will help with direct their decision.

The survey results also show that 52% of people surveyed prioritized reducing crime and improving public safety. And 31% of people want to see the county create more affordable housing and homeownership opportunities. While 60% of people said that road conditions were ""fair"" or ""poor, only 39% said it was a top priority.

The public's ""perception about the county's financial future sits at odds with its budget reality as one-time federal funding will soon dry up and as inflation and population growth stretch the County's budget further,"" according to the press statement.

""It's ironic that nearly two-thirds of survey respondents think we have the financial resources needed to deliver on these essential services,"" Board Chair Carrie Warren-Gully said in the press statement. ""Because without additional revenue, the County is facing significant budget cuts come 2025.""

Growth in the county's budget has been flat for 25 years, despite increasing costs, record population growth and demands for programs like the ones funded by the American Rescue Plan Act. Without an increase in revenue, county leadership will be forced to make more significant cuts in services, affecting businesses and residents. Programs and services across all areas and departments are likely to be affected, according to a county press statement.

Money from the American Rescue Plan Act, aimed at preventing homelessness and boosting affordable housing, has essentially all been used and won't be repeated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers Thursday she would welcome legislation that would ""clarify for banks what their responsibilities are"" when it comes to banking cannabis companies.

Rep. David Joyce, R-OH, had asked Yellen about her department's position on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act, which would make it easier for banks to serve state-legal cannabis businesses.

Joyce, who co-chairs the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, said he had flagged to former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin five years ago the issue created for cannabis companies by conflicting state and federal laws. Not much has changed in the meantime, Joyce expressed.

More than three-quarters of the country has legalized cannabis in some form at a state level - 38 states made it available for medical use, and 24 have approved it for recreational use. However, it's still illegal at the federal level, and still a Schedule 3 substance under the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Its federal illegality presents a hurdle for banks, who remain concerned about violating anti-money laundering laws. And because the number of banks who will touch cannabis-tied money remains relatively small, cannabis companies report that they're forced to do business in cash. This, they say, creates security issues - such as armed robbery - and, from a business perspective, makes financing a challenge.

""The fact that marijuana is outlawed by the federal government creates an impediment to [banks'] willingness to provide banking services, services to cannabis firms, and it creates all the problems that you're familiar with,"" Yellen told lawmakers Thursday. ""I think legislation may be necessary to raise the comfort level banks have with doing this business.""

Legislation related to cannabis banking has been passed by the House seven times in the past decade, but has yet to be heard on the Senate floor. In a historic first, the Senate Banking Committee approved a revised bill in September by 14-9, sending the legislation to the full Senate.

Steny Hoyer, D-MD, said Thursday he would do his part to help pass SAFER Banking, as the current cash-heavy situation is putting people who work around it ""in a vulnerable position.""",bankingdive.com,news,Banking Dive,Gabrielle Saulsbery,0.02745098039215677,448831623,1,https://www.bankingdive.com/imgproxy/SBr5f_eMjfd9TJb_UvOVkpqnW5lR_4R7s-X0oZzlqcY/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0l0ZW05Y2FubmFiaXNwbGFudHNwaG90by5qcGc.webp,eng-9415938

The House impeachment inquiry has transitioned to a new phase, with a significant shift in focus towards investigating a possible coverup in Hunter Biden's tax case.

Following a hearing involving Hunter Biden's business partners, the House Judiciary Committee has taken action, suing the Justice Department to compel two attorneys to testify about potential political interference in Hunter Biden's tax prosecution.

The House Judiciary Committee, along with the House Oversight Committee, has addressed a letter to CIA Director William Burns, revealing the existence of a whistleblower who alleges CIA intervention to hinder witness interviews in the case.

According to the letter, the whistleblower claims that the CIA intervened to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) from interviewing a key witness associated with Hunter Biden.

The Judiciary Chairman, Jim Jordan, and Oversight Chairman, James Comer, assert that the whistleblower's information suggests CIA interference occurred when IRS investigators were preparing to interview Patrick Kevin Morris, an associate of Hunter Biden.

Allegedly, the CIA summoned DOJ officials to its headquarters, indicating that Morris could not participate in the investigation.

This development marks a notable shift in the House investigation. Previously focused on allegations of influence peddling involving the Biden family and their associates, the inquiry has now expanded to examine potential efforts to impede the discovery or prosecution of crimes in Hunter Biden's case.

The House committees leading the probe seek to ascertain whether government actors obstructed justice or favored the Bidens.

The lawsuit filed by the House Judiciary Committee against the Justice Department highlights ongoing efforts to uncover a potential coverup, emphasizing the importance of testimony from key individuals involved in the case.

Despite Democratic criticisms and claims that the Biden impeachment is defunct, unresolved questions persist regarding evidence and testimony uncovered by the investigation.

The House committees remain committed to exploring allegations of improper treatment by the Justice Department and any efforts to hinder the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs.",otakukart.com,news,OtakuKart,Justin Oneal,0.0980392156862746,448831599,1,https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Whistleblower-alleges-CIA-interference-in-Hunter-Bidens-tax-probe.jpg,eng-9408950

But now, researchers are replacing these materials with porous components made from protein biomass that is often discarded by the food and agricultural industries. These components are sustainable and biodegradable, and could potentially allow future diapers and sanitary pads to be flushed down a toilet or used as fertilizer.

The researchers will present their results today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Spring 2024 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in person March 17-21; it features nearly 12,000 presentations on a range of science topics.

Antonio Capezza, who will present the research at the meeting, says that in Europe, regulations discourage the use of certain petroleum-based plastics in disposable goods. However, there aren't clear guidelines or regulations to ban these plastics in diapers, sanitary pads and other disposable sanitary items, he notes, because a good replacement hasn't been available. ""But we're hoping to change that with our protein-based materials.""

Of course, washable diapers avoid the plastics issue altogether, but he says that few caregivers want to use them. He is aiming to provide a different type of sustainable, non-polluting solution to people who want to continue using disposable sanitary products. ""The acceptance rate will be much higher than if you come to a customer and say, 'Okay, now you have to wash your diapers,'"" explains Capezza, a researcher in the polymeric materials division at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.

Ironically, the project had its origins in a demonstration designed to teach students what can go wrong in the lab. Capezza was showing them how to make bioplastic filaments using proteins. To mimic the impact of unwanted humidity, he added wet cotton, which caused the mixture to foam. Once the product dried, he realized, the material had become super porous, meaning it could sop up liquid like a sponge.

""So it was sort of an accident, but a good one, because that led us to an entirely new line of research,"" he says. Capezza is collaborating with researchers at KTH, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and other institutions, including Simón Bolívar University in Venezuela, the University of Tokyo in Japan and the University of Seville in Spain.

Some cotton-based alternatives to plastic sanitary products are already on the market, but they rely on virgin cotton and may need bleaching or other chemical treatment for their production. Looking for a more sustainable material source, Capezza's team identified proteins and other natural molecules left over from food and agricultural production that might otherwise be landfilled or incinerated: for instance, zein from corn, gluten from wheat and natural antioxidant extracts.

The researchers mixed the proteins together in different proportions and added water and bicarbonates, such as baking soda, as foaming agents; the sweetener glycerol as a plasticizer; and natural extracts as preservatives.

The team then used equipment and processing techniques from the plastics industry, including extrusion, to make various components commonly found in pads and diapers. Similar to a pasta maker, the extruder enabled the team to produce filaments and flat sheets while at the same time allowing them to foam the materials. With these techniques, the researchers produced a flat ""nonwoven"" layer that remained dry to the touch while allowing liquid to rapidly pass through; a fluffy porous material with superabsorbent properties that captured liquid; and waterproof films to protect outer garments.

As a proof of concept, the researchers assembled these components to make protein-based absorbent prototypes that resembled disposable sanitary products. Once exposed to water or soil, the materials completely biodegraded in a few weeks. Because of the materials' protein origin, this degradation released carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, amino acids and other compounds that nature can reuse as nutrients.

With further development, Capezza says, this could lead to single-use sanitary products that can be flushed. Alternatively, after use, these products (or any waste produced at the manufacturing stage) could be composted to fertilize crops, such as corn and wheat, which would in turn provide the starting materials to make new sanitary products. ""So it's a fully circular design,"" Capezza adds. The researchers have already shown that plants grow longer leaves and roots when exposed to this compost. ""And our tests have shown that because it's protein based, there's no risk whatsoever that these products will pollute the soil with microplastics or other unwanted chemicals when they break down.""

Protein-based sanitary products would be about 10 to 20% more expensive than traditional plastic diapers and pads, Capezza estimates. The performance of protein sanitary pads is similar to that of conventional pads. On the other hand, protein diapers aren't as absorbent as their plastic counterparts. That means protein diapers would either need to be thicker, or their formulation would need to be tweaked to improve absorption. To boost liquid uptake and mechanical strength, the researchers are now exploring the addition of lignocellulose, a blend of lignin and cellulose that's found in plants. This material is a low-value byproduct of the farming and forestry sectors. Results to date show its addition is bringing performance close to that of conventional diapers.

The team is now preparing for pilot studies to test the feasibility of scaling up production. Additional evaluations, including human skin irritation tests, will need to be done before any of these products can go on the market, Capezza says.",sciencedaily.com,news,ScienceDaily,,0.003921568627450966,448831515,1,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,

The county's current curbside waste collection contract ends in September 2026, and councillors need to decide what to include in the next contract by this September so any new trucks or specialized bins can be ordered in time to ensure a smooth transition.

Almost everything is up for debate, including bag limits, collection frequency, bag tags, which communities get leaf and yard waste pickup, and how to implement a provincially encouraged organic waste collection program to divert waste from landfill.

There are so many options to consider, each with its own price tag, that councillors will have a special workshop outside of the usual meeting schedule to discuss how best to provide one of the few municipal services that benefits all residents, no matter where they live.

To aid council's deliberations, county staff plan to get resident feedback through surveys and open houses.

At the moment, garbage is collected weekly, and each household can put up to four bags at the curb. The average household generates about 500 kilograms of garbage every year, which works out to just over 14,000 metric tons countywide.

Collecting, hauling and disposing of all that trash currently costs just under $3.2 million annually.

Reducing the limit to three or even two bags per week would not affect the vast majority of residents who do not regularly generate that much garbage, waste management supervisor Merissa Bokla told council on Tuesday.

""A bag reduction also pairs nicely with an organics program,"" Bokla said, since green waste would be collected separately and not count toward the limit.

Bokla said widespread labour shortages leave many waste collection companies unwilling to bid on manual collection contracts, where workers toss bags in by hand. The municipal trend is to move to automated systems where a single employee drives the truck and operates a mechanical arm that picks up bins.

Going that route would involve a high startup cost but save on labour, Bokla explained.

The debate over how to collect trash most efficiency and equitably in a far-flung county with rural and urban areas comes as Ontario is running out of landfill space and the companies that produce recyclable materials are now in charge of collecting them, a job that used to be a municipal responsibility.

Residents in some of Norfolk's smaller rural communities are clamouring for leaf and yard waste collection, while council has already devoted significant time this year to debating the merits of various green bin options and how to keep the streets of downtown Simcoe free of illegally dumped garbage.

Public works boss Andrew Grice encouraged councillors to think about the county's long-term waste collection needs, noting contracts only open up every decade or so.

Coun. Doug Brunton sees a complicated road ahead before council strikes the right balance with the new contract.

""This is going to be a very costly thing at the end, no matter which way we go,"" Brunton said.

""And we've got to keep it competitive.""

In New York, the price of uranium futures has dipped to $88.50 per pound, a decrease from the peak seen in February, which was a 16-year high, yet remains significantly above the average price of $66.60 recorded last year.

Jonathan Hinze, president of UxC, a nuclear industry research firm told the news outlet: ""We have reached a bottom. The fundamentals are still strong, with increased demand and supply that hasn't fully responded.""

According to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Kozak, there's evidence to suggest that uranium prices have stabilized. Kozak forecasts a resurgence of fundamental buyers in the market, which is expected to propel prices upwards once more, Bloomberg wrote this week.

Optimistic investors are focusing on uranium's future, driven by an increasing supply shortage and higher demand, as nations (finally pull their heads out from their a** and) seek nuclear energy solutions for climate change.

This interest is highlighted amid supply warnings from Canada's Cameco and Kazakhstan's Kazatomprom, the leading producers responsible for half of the worldwide uranium supply. Kazatomprom forecasts a significant supply deficit escalating from 21 million pounds in 2030 to 147 million pounds by 2040.

Geopolitical tensions, including a U.S. proposal to ban Russian uranium imports, which are essential for nuclear power and weapons, add complexity to the supply scenario, the report says. However, the potential resurgence of dormant mining operations due to rising uranium prices poses a risk of dampening the market rally, reminiscent of the recent boom-to-bust cycle in battery metals.

According to the indictment, Milton C. Grimes, an attorney in Los Angeles, owed the IRS more than $1.7 million in taxes for tax years 2010 and 2014. The IRS allegedly tried to collect the unpaid taxes from Grimes by, among other things, levying his bank accounts. In response to the IRS' collection efforts, from 2014 through 2020, Grimes allegedly engaged in a scheme to thwart the IRS' levies by keeping his personal bank account balances low by routinely purchasing cashier's checks and withdrawing cash from his business bank accounts, often immediately after depositing funds to his business bank accounts, thereby avoiding funding his personal accounts. Grimes allegedly withdrew approximately $16 million in funds from the accounts in cashier's checks during those years.

In addition, Grimes allegedly filed individual income tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021 reporting that he owed approximately $700,000 in taxes. Grimes allegedly did not, and has not, paid the taxes that he self-reported he owes.

In total, Grimes is alleged to have caused a tax loss of approximately $2,418,050 to the IRS.

If convicted, Grimes faces up to five years in prison for the tax evasion count and up to one year in prison for each count of willful failure to pay taxes. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

(File image)

As more and more women embrace their true capabilities and achieve financial independence, they are now actively participating in important life choices, such as buying a house or making property investments. This has resulted in the demand for loans going up.

A 2019 study conducted by ANAROCK, a leading Indian real estate company, revealed that approximately 30-35 per cent of homebuyers in the country were women. Another survey conducted by ANAROCK found that out of the women homebuyers, 78 per cent preferred to purchase homes for personal use, while 22 per cent intended to buy properties for investment purposes.

Atul Monga, CEO and Co-founder of Basic Home Loan informs that with the number of women applying for home loans increasing significantly, several lending institutions are offering a wide range of advantages for first-time homebuyers.

The CEO and Co-founder of Basic Home Loan lists these exclusive advantages that women can enjoy when applying for a home loan --

Lower Interest Rates for Women Borrowers

A significant advantage for female borrowers in India is the opportunity to secure housing loans at lower interest rates. Lenders typically offer a 0.05 per cent to 0.10 per cent reduction in home loan interest rates for women. Although seemingly marginal, this reduction translates into substantial savings over the loan's duration.

Beyond mere financial benefits, these lower interest rates aim to promote gender equality in property ownership, acknowledging women's financial stability and creditworthiness. For instance, consider a borrower securing a Rs 1 crore home loan for a 20-year tenure.

While male borrowers may receive an 8.9 per cent interest rate, female borrowers could enjoy a slightly lower rate of 8.8 per cent. Over the loan term, this translates to Rs 1 lakh in interest savings for female borrowers.

Tax Benefits and Exemptions

Women borrowers in India also enjoy various tax benefits and exemptions when availing of home loans. The Indian Income Tax Act provides deductions and exemptions that significantly reduce tax liabilities for women homeowners:

Deduction on Home Loan Interest: Under Section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, women homeowners can claim deductions on the interest paid on home loans, up to Rs 2 lakh per annum, leading to substantial tax savings.

Principal Repayment Deduction: Section 80C allows deductions on the principal amount repaid towards home loans, with a maximum limit of Rs 1.5 lakh, further reducing tax burdens.

Joint Home Loan Benefits: Co-applicants in a joint home loan, including women, can individually avail of tax benefits, offering significant advantages for married couples purchasing property together.

Stamp Duty Exemption: Some states provide partial or full exemptions on stamp duty charges for women buyers, resulting in substantial savings during property registration.

Easier Loan Approvals

In addition to financial benefits, women borrowers enjoy advantages in loan approvals:

Better Credit Profile: Women typically maintain stronger credit histories due to responsible financial habits, including timely bill payments and lower debt-to-income ratios. Lenders perceive such borrowers as more responsible and reliable.

Higher Loan Eligibility: Lenders may offer higher loan amounts to women borrowers due to their perceived creditworthiness, facilitating purchases of prime properties or larger homes.

Favourable Loan Terms: Women borrowers often negotiate more favourable loan terms, such as longer repayment periods or lower processing fees. Banks extend loans ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 3.5 crore to women, with repayment periods of up to 25 years, incentivising them to take out loans.

Critical factors to consider:

Securing a home loan demands meticulous long-term planning involving thorough comparisons of interest rates, features, and additional benefits. It's imperative to assess your home loan eligibility to determine the amount you qualify for and explore strategies to enhance it. Always conduct due diligence to ensure you make informed decisions tailored to your financial needs and aspirations. Keep the following in mind:

● Conduct thorough comparisons of loan offers from different lenders to ensure optimal terms and features.

● Review all terms and conditions, including interest rates, fees, and repayment obligations, to make informed decisions.

● Consider long-term financial implications, ensuring affordability and alignment with future goals.

● Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to property ownership and taxation.

Atul Monga says that empowering women in India through enhanced access to homeownership opportunities is essential for fostering economic empowerment and gender equality.

What if the looming calamities of climate change, plastic pollution, the energy crisis and our whole environmental dilemma are symptoms of just one malady and it's something we actually can fix?

That's right, the planet is fighting a single archvillain: waste.

Americans live in the most wasteful civilization in history. This goes way beyond what we roll to the curb each week. It's rooted in what we eat and drink and how we cook. It's the main thing you pay for in your utility bills and at the gas pump. Waste is so deeply embedded in our economy, products and daily lives that it's hard to see clearly, or to see at all.

Thinking of seemingly unsolvable Earth-destroying crises as byproducts of waste is powerful and hopeful. There's no partisan divide where one side says, ""Yay waste!"" Instead there are ordinary blue state and red state people at work in our neighborhoods right now, showing us how to tackle waste and the catastrophes it drives; and saving, even making money while doing it.

The Canada Revenue Agency says Festus Bayden, of Brampton, Ont., was a partner in a tax preparation business known as E & F Tax Associates or as Bankay Financial Services Inc. in Toronto and later in Brampton.

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

One of the state's highest elected officials, in comments before members of the Boston business community yesterday, signaled that he is open to legislation involving the creation of a real estate transfer fee, bringing renewed optimism for housing advocates on the Island.

According to State House News Service and other media, Massachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano said he would consider the fee -- which would set aside revenue from a tax on real estate transactions to support housing initiatives -- although he stopped short of fully endorsing the initiative.

Island officials say it is the clearest signal he's given publicly about the measure, signifying that the bill could be progressing through the legislative process. After six town meetings endorsed the option to impose a transfer fee in 2022, some 250 Islanders took to the State House a year ago to lobby for the option to impose a fee. Gov. Maura Healey has also supported the option, but Mariano has been mostly quiet on the issue.

""Now, I understand that the idea of a transfer fee is a cause for concern for some of you, but if you believe that the issue of housing affordability is a genuine crisis, then we must explore all options that have the potential to make a real difference,"" Mariano said during the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce forum on Thursday, according to the news service. ""I look forward to having continued conversations with members, and with the business community, on how we can bolster the development of more affordable housing, while ensuring that Massachusetts remains competitive.""

Mariano later told reporters that he is unsure if he has the votes in the House to pass the legislation; he also discussed some of the finer details of possible legislation.

His comments have created a buzz for Island housing advocates who have long pushed for a transfer fee.

""I'm more optimistic than ever that the legislature will realize a local-option transfer fee on real estate this session,"" state Senator Julian Cyr told The Times in a statement. ""I feel buoyed by the speaker's comments that endorse the policy, and I'll continue to work to advance a transfer fee in the Senate. The revenue from a transfer fee will be a lifeline to Islanders struggling to afford to live on Martha's Vineyard. It is my highest priority to get a local-option transfer fee passed into law.""

Adam Turner, executive director of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, reached on Friday, also expressed optimism, noting that the speaker had recognized the idea of bringing the legislation forward. Turner says there's been broad support on the Islands for the transfer fee, and that the tool could be a benefit to developing much-needed housing on the Island.

Tucker Holland, an advocate for housing on Nantucket, said he's encouraged by Mariano commenting, noting that the speaker has yet to speak publicly about the transfer fee.

""It was so encouraging that he not only spoke publicly about it for the first time, but he shared these thoughts with the people that he did,"" Holland said, noting that there has been opposition to the idea with builders and real estate lobbies present at the chamber meeting. ""I applaud him for bringing up this critical issue and tool with a group that hasn't necessarily been in favor of it.""

Holland also noted that Mariano did not come right out and endorse the effort. According to State House News, when asked whether he supports the tax, Mariano said that there were some nuances that would have to be worked out. He said that Governor Maura Healey's proposal would allow municipalities to impose a fee of 0.5 to 2 percent of a property sale above $1 million, which he said could be too much.

But he also noted that the structure of the fee could be different from community to community, explicitly pointing out that Nantucket may have different needs than other Massachusetts communities.

Holland notes that Gov. Healey's proposal would also set aside $4 billion for housing initiatives, aside from allowing communities to enact a transfer fee. But Holland says that much of that $4 billion would go to funding residents in lower income levels. He noted that this was needed across the state. ""But the need goes so much further on the Islands,"" he said.

""On Nantucket, you need to be earning 5 times the [area median income] to be able to afford a home,"" Holland added. ""We need to be able to have a reliable and significant revenue stream that can support the work we need to do, serving a variety of income levels on the Islands.""

According to the IRS, promoters are entities that ""undermine voluntary compliance by marketing improper methods to reduce the amount of taxes legally owed."" The penalties on conduct associated with such promotion can be financially ruinous. This article provides an overview of the most commonly asserted promoter penalties and offers high-level strategies for handling a promoter audit.

The IRS established the Office of Promoter Investigations in 2021. The purpose of the OPI, to put it bluntly, is earlier intervention into the market for tax avoidance transactions. OPI was designed to identify marketed tax avoidance activity in real time, or as close to it as possible, and to use all available legal tools to quickly disincentivize promotional activity that the IRS finds inappropriate. The IRS is pouring resources into ""promoter"" investigations and we expect significant and increasing activity in that space for the foreseeable future. (We use the term ""promoter"" because that is IRS terminology.)

A complete discussion of all the possible promoter penalties, and the intricacies of each, is beyond the scope of this article, but the penalties most commonly at issue are Section 6700, 6701 and 6694.

Section 6700 imposes a penalty on any person who:

Section 6701 provides that any person ""who aids or assists in, procures or advises with respect to, the preparation or presentation of any potion of a return ... claim or other document, who knows (or has reason to believe)"" that such portion ""will be used in connection with any material matter arising under the internal revenue laws, and who knows that such portion (if so used) would result in an understatement"" of another person's tax liability, is subject to a penalty of $1,000 per individual customer ($10,000 per corporate customer).

Section 6694 penalizes any person who ""prepares any return or claim of refund"" that results in an ""understatement of liability"" (including an ""overstatement of the net amount creditable or refundable"") due to an unreasonable position and who ""knew (or reasonably should have known) of the [unreasonable] position"". The penalty is the greater of $1,000 or 50 percent of the income derived (or to be derived) by the tax return preparer with respect to the return or claim.

Injunctions and disgorgement also exist. While an injunction is not technically a penalty, the Department of Justice has recently sought disgorgement of all ""ill gotten gains"" as part of several injunction proceedings. Disgorgement is a legal remedy that necessitates a party who has profited from illegal or wrongful actions to surrender any gains acquired because of such illicit or wrongful behavior, and such disgorgement can be thought of as a penalty.

Strategies for handling a promoter audit

With the IRS continuing to launch these promoter audits, it is important that anyone subject to such an audit consider a few strategic issues.

Cabin scope: The IRS typically investigates promoters broadly. Agents will typically ask for all documents that might be related, i.e., emails, client documents, client lists and revenue information. These investigations can be cumbersome and distracting from the business of the person or entity being investigated. In responding to a promoter investigation, you want to be responsive and cooperative while also juggling the invasive and costly nature of the investigation. Cabining the scope, or limiting or restricting the extent of the investigation, if possible, is one way to achieve those goals.

Keep it civil: Promoter investigations can be conducted in parallel to, or lead to, criminal investigations. Demonstrating a lack of scienter or evasive conduct during the investigation can help minimize potential criminal exposure.

Prepare penalty defenses: Most of the promoter penalties hinge on the promoter's requisite mental state to determine if the conduct is ""penalizable."" Documenting penalty defenses during the investigation has multiple benefits. First, actions are fresh in memory, including steps taken, relied-upon authority, advisors consulted, etc. Second, documents can become unavailable over time, discussed further below. Third, if the IRS ultimately pursues penalties or an injunction, your penalty defenses will be crucial, including legal or tax advice and evidence of compliance efforts.

Gather records: With the passage of time, records get lost or destroyed, whether through unexpected events or just plain old document retention policies. Unfortunately, in some instances, the failure to produce a document that would support your position can be construed against you in court. To avoid detrimental inferences, gather the records while you can so you can utilize them in response to IRS inquiries or in a later court proceeding.

Fast resolution, or prepare for court: Promoter audits usually take a long time, in part because of the issues but likely also because multiple appellate courts have held that there is no statute of limitations for the Section 6700 and 6701 penalties. This means the IRS does not worry about a deadline. While lengthy audits might favor the alleged promoter in some cases, seeking a quick and acceptable resolution can mitigate risk. Of course, that is not always possible, and in some cases the IRS and DOJ will be unrelenting in their pursuit of penalties. Unfortunately, the best strategy in such cases usually calls for intense litigation which, while expensive, can be productive.

Informing clients: Persons undergoing promoter audits must decide whether to inform their clients. In our experience, many such persons want to keep that information confidential, but that can be difficult as the IRS typically interviews third parties when investigating alleged promoters and may attempt to use information obtained in a promoter audit in taxpayer audits. Some promoters do not want their clients to hear about the investigation first from the IRS but would rather be transparent about the investigation and IRS scrutiny. Finally, promoters are free to inform their clients about the IRS investigation -- and some may have contractual obligations to do so -- but all should expect that any communications about the investigation will be evaluated by the IRS and/or reappear in any later court proceeding.

As the IRS intensifies its focus on promoters of tax avoidance transactions and subsequent investigations or audits, the penalties associated with such activities can be financially devastating. Given the intrusive nature of these investigations, entities must contemplate a strategic approach or engage counsel to assist them in their strategic approach if audited. Moreover, transparency with clients regarding ongoing IRS scrutiny is a strategic decision that warrants careful consideration amid these challenging circumstances.",accountingtoday.com,news,Accounting Today,"Michael Cohn, Paige Hagy",-0.1686274509803921,448830758,1,https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ec1dc8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2F95%2F021b51a74a8f93d36ab8e268ad75%2Firs-building-spotlight.jpg,eng-9411260

Construct Capital led the funding round, with Workshop Ventures participating and strategic individual investments from Steve Fredette (Toast's president and co-founder) and Tom Kuo (A-Street's co-founder and chairman of the board at Mighty Earth).

The company's maintenance and energy management platform detects, diagnoses, and services HVAC and refrigeration (HVAC/R) systems in small commercial buildings. Utilizing a network of wireless sensors, Monaire's AI-enabled software monitors performance in a building's HVAC/R systems, automatically preventing energy waste and detecting problems. After issues are found, Monaire immediately diagnoses the problem and automatically dispatches an available technician to make repairs.

There are more than 5.6 million small commercial buildings, such as strip malls, gas stations, restaurants, and other small retail businesses, comprising 94% of the commercial buildings in the US. Even though buildings are part of our daily lives, they're expensive to maintain and have older, less efficient HVAC/R systems more likely to need repair, costing building owners an average of $17,000 per year per building in lost revenue, repair costs, and food waste.

Small commercial building HVAC/R systems are a considerable source of carbon emissions, estimated to release 7.5 GT of CO2e in wasted emissions through 2050. Monaire aims to prevent 1 GT of that waste by creating new efficiencies, reducing system runtimes, preventing refrigerant leaks and food spoilage, upgrading HVAC/R systems, and reducing inefficient operations. It will also help build and run a more sustainable, efficient grid.

The funding will be used to continue developing its proprietary sensors and AI technology and expand into additional markets across the United States.

KEY QUOTES:

""Upgrading and efficiently managing HVAC/R systems requires a lot of money and skilled technicians, both of which are often out of reach for the owners of small commercial buildings. Monaire eases that pain by modernizing a building's existing HVAC/R system using our advanced wireless sensors, smart controllers, and AI monitoring. Instead of wasting food, energy, and money while waiting for emergency fixes, Monaire instantly makes buildings more efficient while automatically detecting and fixing problems before they fail.""

- Rahul Subramany, Co-founder of Monaire

The CRA says Bayden claimed more than $34 million in false charitable donations on individual income tax returns for the 2004 to 2006 tax years that he prepared for more than 30 of his clients.

It says he told his clients that a larger refund, or reduced taxes, could be obtained if they made a charitable donation for an amount that was far less than what was actually claimed on their income tax returns.

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

""These promoters deliberately make false statements to assist their clients in avoiding or evading tax,"" the Canada Revenue Agency said in a statement.

To celebrate the occasion, Lucasfilm is re-releasing the film in theaters this May the Fourth (or May the Third, actually, since that's when the first screenings take place).

The Phantom Menace, of course, is the first prequel to George Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy. Is it good? Is it bad? The answer to those questions is a perennial Star Wars debate, one perhaps you can bring up with your seatmate (or not) if/when you rewatch it this May in theaters.

If seeing The Phantom Menace once again on a big screen is not enough Star Wars for you, don't fret: The screenings will also include a sneak peek of Star Wars: Acolyte, the upcoming series that takes place 100 years before young Anakin was toddling across the sands of Tatooine.

And if that's still not enough Star Wars for your eyeballs, Lucasfilm has got you covered. In celebration of May the Fourth, select theaters will be hosting a movie marathon featuring all nine features in the Skywalker Saga. (If you decide to do this, here's two words of advice from someone who has already done this: compression socks.)

Tickets for the return of The Phantom Menace are already available for sale. If you're ready to spend over twenty hours in a theater, you can find details about theaters hosting the marathon event here.

city residents, who have for years endured boil-water orders that ultimately escalated into the crisis that

drew national outrage two years ago. So it was another slap in the face for Jackson residents when state

lawmakers recently gave Amazon a fortune in taxpayer money to build two massive data centers just

outside the city -- facilities that could require millions of gallons of water every day.

In January, state legislators hastily approved a $44 million incentive package to seal the deal for

Amazon Web Services to locate the data centers just north of Jackson at a pair of industrial parks in

Madison County. As if that weren't enough, lawmakers authorized Madison County to borrow $215

million from the state to pay for improvements to roads and the extension of water and sewer

systems. While Amazon will pay this back over time, they get to do it in place of paying taxes to the

county.

Governor Reeves and state lawmakers have since celebrated the deal, calling it the biggest private

investment project in Mississippi's history. But they are less eager to talk about giving one of the

world's wealthiest companies a taxpayer-funded handout to build water-hogging facilities at a time

when Jackson residents are still feeling the effects of the recent water crisis -- a crisis fueled by an

appalling lack of investment in the region's infrastructure.

While most people have probably heard about data centers, they may not understand exactly what it

takes to operate these facilities. Data centers are essential for our modern technology needs, such

as cloud computing. They also require massive amounts of resources to operate -- not just

electricity, but water for cooling systems that prevent servers from overheating. By some estimates,

large data centers can use a staggering 1 million to 5 million gallons of water daily -- equivalent to a

town of 10,000 to 50,000 people.

All of this raises some important questions: Why would the state give Amazon $44 million and a

sweetheart loan to divert so much of the region's water away from Jackson? Where will the water for

the data centers come from? Most importantly, why not invest this money in the city's water

infrastructure to help prevent the next major water crisis?

For many long-time Jackson residents, the answer to the last question is steeped in a legacy of

institutionalized neglect in a city where 80 percent of residents are Black. Consistently on the brink of

failure, Jackson's water system woes date back to the 1880s, when local leaders created a plan to

pump the Pearl River to help combat a fire and authorized a private company to deliver river water

through a network of underground pipes. Advocacy groups like the NAACP and Southern Poverty

Law Center maintain a timeline of the manmade water crisis plaguing residents.

Today, Jackson residents are afraid to use their tap water for washing dishes or brushing their teeth.

Yet, instead of address the problem, Governor Reeves openly talks about how he once helped block

funding for water system repairs in the city. Now, adding insult to injury, the immense amount of

resources that will eventually be required to operate Amazon's data centers may only make things

worse.

While the state has already approved the funding for Amazon, it is not too late for Jackson's

community leaders and residents to demand answers from lawmakers and Amazon. The city

deserves to know how Amazon's data centers will affect its infrastructure and what the state and the

company will do to ensure they are not overtaxing a water system that officials have said is on the

brink of collapsing.

The people of Jackson deserve better. Commitments to address the city's water crisis and build the

necessary infrastructure for long-term solutions must be part of the plans for bringing Amazon's

resource-straining data centers to the region. Anything less would be yet another symbol of the

institutional neglect for the city's infrastructure and will have devasting consequences for residents.",jacksonadvocateonline.com,news,jacksonadvocateonline.com,,0.0980392156862746,448830519,1,https://jacksonadvocateonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-design-35.png,eng-9412856

Woodstock - a city of about 46,000 people - initially had a municipal budget proposed at about $98 million. That would've increased taxes by 4.86 per cent, adding $135 to the average home - ""average"" being one assessed at $267,000.

But after politicians added new projects, the 2024 spending plan swelled to more than $107 million. That means a 7.42 per cent tax hike for local property owners, or $206 on the average home's bill. It's significantly larger than Woodstock's 2023 tax hike of 4.32 per cent ($146 per average home).

Woodstock's 2024 tax hike is smaller than London's 8.7 per cent but larger than several others across the region. For example, the similarly sized St. Thomas, a city of about 39,000, kept its hike at 2.95 per cent, adding $88 to an average home assessed at $204,000.

But not everyone on Woodstock city council supported the budget.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Coun. Deb Tait, the lone holdout, thought the tax hike was too hefty. She told The London Free Press after the meeting: ""They're going to flip out when they get their tax bill.""

Tait also cited the approval of a streetscape project to revitalize Woodstock's downtown - a construction project to make upgrades such as adding new sidewalks and installing streetlights and furniture - as another reason she opposed the budget.

""I can't support a budget, any budget, that has the streetscape. . . . I can't do it,"" Tait said.

Council approved one phase of the project at a cost of $2.7 million at Thursday's meeting. The entire project would cost $7.4 million, although council can vote at a future meeting whether to proceed.

City politicians on Thursday approved several last-minute budget additions, including hiring 17 full-time staff and converting three part-time positions to full-time ones, adding a total of $800,000 to the 2024 spending plan.

""(I'm) absolutely comfortable with the approval of the full-time equivalent staff,"" Coun. Bernia Martin said following the meeting. ""We're growing exponentially as a city and many of our departments have not had new staff members added in decades.

""Paying more tax means that we are delivering services to the people who need it most in this community.""

After the meeting, Mayor Acchione said he understands nobody likes to pay more in taxes.

""As a resident of the City of Woodstock myself, and (as) a taxpayer, I understand the tax burden is on everybody,"" he said, adding that because Woodstock is ""continuing to grow even more this year and next,"" it's paramount to add additional staff.

The approved budget also contains several new initiatives from city hall including additional public transit hours, new physician recruitment efforts and boosting reserve funds for bridge and road reconstruction along with street lighting to alleviate the tax hikes in future years.

""I'm really proud of this council, and looking at each one individually,"" Acchione said.

Councillors approved plans this week to introduce the increase which will bring the local authority in line with most of Scotland and follows a change in national legislation.

Under new legislation, the council now have powers to increase the level of tax, with increases limited to a 100 per cent surcharge on top of standard rates.

And council tax will now double for second homes.

Council Leader Joe Fagan said: ""Holiday homes aren't as prevalent in our areas as they are in other parts of the country, with only 174 properties identified as second homes.

""But recent committee reports have identified significant pressure on housing, with an increase in the number of people applying for assistance due to homelessness and a backlog of homeless households awaiting permanent offers of housing.

""We need to take every opportunity we can to address these pressures, and the £126,000 it is estimated will be raised by the increase in council tax on second homes will go to the council's Affordable Housing Supply Programme to support acquisitions and new affordable housing.""

Those who owned a second home previously received a ten per cent discount on standard council tax rates but last year's Council Tax (Variation for Unoccupied Dwellings (Scotland) Amendment Regulations gave councils discretionary powers to change this.

Changes for each tax band will be as follows:

Band A annual property charge is £867.21, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £780.49, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £1734.42. Band B annual property charge is £1011.74, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £910.57, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £2023.48. Band C annual property charge is £1156.28, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £1040.65, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £2312.56. Band D annual property charge is £1300.81, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £1170.73, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £2601.62. Band E annual property charge is £1709.12, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £1538.21, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £3418.24. Band F annual property charge is £2113.82, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £1902.44, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £4227.64. Band G annual property charge is £2547.42, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £2292.68, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £5094.84. Band H annual property charge is £3186.98, the annual charge currently (including the 10 per cent discount) is £2868.28, the new annual property charge after the 100 per cent surcharge will now be £6373.96.

Oklahoma eliminated its statewide tax on grocery purchases, and Tennessee is now considering similar legislation.

Tennessee is one of 12 remaining states that still taxes residents on grocery purchases, but the legislature is currently considering a bill to do away with the 4% charge.

Nashville Rep. Aftyn Behn, who filed HB 2043 to cut the tax, says the bill would save households more than $400 a year on average. But it would cost the state somewhere between $700 million to $1.1 billion a year.

""Food should not be a financial burden on hardworking Tennessee families,"" Behn said in a statement.

Behn could not immediately be reached for comment.

She said in a statement that the lowest-income fifth of families spend nearly two times the share of their annual income on groceries compared to those in the highest-income fifth of income earners in the state.

Oklahoma eliminated its 4.5% statewide grocery tax in early March, and Illinois is also considering cutting its 1% tax.

Other states that tax groceries include: Mississippi at 7%; Kansas at 6.5%; Idaho at 6%; South Dakota at 4.5%; Alabama, and Hawaii at 4%; Virginia at 2.5%; Utah at 1.75%; Arkansas at 1.5%; and Missouri at 1.23%.",supermarketnews.com,news,Supermarket News,Timothy Inklebarger,0.08235294117647052,448829973,1,https://www.supermarketnews.com/sites/supermarketnews.com/files/Basket%20Blurry.jpeg,

The CRA says Bayden fled the country before he could be prosecuted, but later returned to Canada in June 2023.

The agency says Bayden pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under the Criminal Code and was sentenced to prison on Feb. 27.

The CRA says Bayden charged his clients approximately 10 per cent of the face value of the false, claimed charitable donation amounts.

The city has said the revenue generated from the tax would go to fight homelessness in Chicago. About 53.6% of Chicago voters had rejected the measure by Wednesday, according to results posted . Plenty of mail-in ballots remain to be counted but the outcome isn't expected to change.

The change would have restructured the real estate transfer tax, ""a one-time tax on properties when they are sold, to create a substantial and legally dedicated revenue stream to provide permanent affordable housing for people experiencing homelessness,"" the city said on a .

Johnson's proposed restructuring would have lowered the tax rate on sales under $1 million to 0.6% from 0.75%. Sales of $1 million to $1.5 million would have had to pay 2%, about 2.5 times the current rate, and sales of $1.5 million and above would have had to pay 3%.

Some criticized the city's proposal for its potential impact on the commercial real estate sector in Chicago. Real estate and development groups had filed suit seeking to keep the question off the ballot, reported.

""We don't know why people voted the way they voted,"" said Joe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation of Chicago, a nonpartisan government research nonprofit. ""But we do know from our perspective that there wasn't enough there to reach a threshold of confidence and trust that this was absolutely needed, in the sense that all other options were explored... and that ranges from revenue to non-revenue levers, before we go to this.""

In a , the Civic Federation highlighted the lack of oversight and accountability measures, the chosen tax structure's likely effect on commercial real estate and the potential volatility of the tax revenues.

""It will be impossible for the residents of Chicago to hold the city accountable for whether funds generated by the new tax have actually helped to improve the lives of people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness,"" the paper said.

There was no reliable analysis of how much money the change would actually bring in, Ferguson told The Bond Buyer. There was insufficient information about how much money was actually needed. And ""there wasn't a meaningful engagement"" with ""certain constituent quarters,"" such as the commercial real estate and multifamily residential sectors.

""They tried to drive straight through it,"" Ferguson said of the city's response to pushback. ""From what we've been told, there were endeavors by various of the associations and sectors that were opposed to this tax... to engage the administration in conversations about alternative measures. And our understanding is, that conversation never has really been engaged.""

Ferguson pointed to the ,

where a transfer tax change projected to bring in roughly $1 billion brought in about $150 million instead -- ""nowhere near enough to achieve the objectives they set out to achieve,"" Ferguson said.

Homelessness, Ferguson said, is a humanitarian crisis that government should be trying to address. But ""if something is important enough for government to do, then it's equally important that the government endeavor to do it well, with full transparency. And that is where we've fallen short here. There's an opportunity for a better accounting... [and] making a better case for why we need additional money going forward.""

The real estate transfer tax proposal's apparent defeat brough a sigh of relief among groups that openly opposed the change. Bryce Hill, director of fiscal and economic research at Illinois Policy, a Chicago-based think tank with libertarian leanings, said the measure would have hurt the city's real estate market.

""Chicago is already struggling with record-high commercial vacancies and the second-highest commercial property taxes in the nation,"" he said. ""This tax hike would've punished the few individuals and businesses moving into the city.""

Chicago also already has $44 million in unused federal funds that could go to fight homelessness, Hill added, plus $200 million budgeted for the current fiscal year.

""Chicagoans saw through the cash grab,"" Hill said. ""Homelessness in Chicago is a significant problem... The most important things the city can do are find ways to attract new businesses and employers to the city and reduce the cost of housing development.""

The defeat of this measure is unlikely to affect Chicago's credit rating or ability to take on new debt, said Ashlee Gabrysch, director and Midwest region manager for local government ratings at Fitch Ratings.

""It's obviously a hit to the ability to execute and implement programs and expenditures for that policy priority, but it doesn't really affect the rest of the corporate spending base,"" she said.

The constraints on the city's ability to control migrant costs are a continuing issue, Gabrysch added, ""and if they were able to use some of that money, that certainly would've been beneficial. There were some questions around whether that would have been possible. But it sort of gets to one of the fundamental weaknesses of the city of Chicago's credit, and that is that they have a really constrained expenditure profile. You've got these pretty sticky labor costs; you've got high debt service and pension costs; there are very few aspects of the corporate spending budget that you can cut.""

When push comes to shove, cities often ""find things that they can live without, at least in the short term,"" said Michael Rinaldi, Fitch senior director and head of local government ratings. But that's ""more challenging for Chicago than it might be for some other municipalities.""

Fitch from BBB last autumn, Rinaldi noted, and ""an important factor in that upgrade was that we had observed over a period of time that the city's liability burden, around debt and pension liabilities, was improving.""

For its part, S&P Global Ratings on Chicago's general obligation bonds to stable from positive, citing budgetary pressures not counterbalanced by new revenue growth. In February, the rating agency laying out the budgetary challenges facing Chicago due to the migrant crisis.

The defeat of the real estate transfer tax measure is ""a lost opportunity for revenue to support new programmatic spending, but is neutral to the existing budget,"" said Scott Nees, director and lead analyst at S&P, pointing out that the Johnson administration had not planned to use the revenues to support operations or fund existing programs.

Fitch's Gabrysch said that from a credit perspective, the city should be focusing on steps like making supplemental pension payments above the statutory requirements.

It should also be avoiding the scoop-and-toss practices ""that patched the city together year to year, but that over the longer horizon, have added to their debt profile, increased the amount that they're spending in debt service and in pension costs... and allowed for less discretionary spending and less room for additional policy priorities,"" she said.

The defeat of the Bring Chicago Home proposal leaves the Johnson administration no worse off than it was before the election, the Civic Fed's Ferguson said.

""We have the same amount of revenue generation potential that we had before we took this vote,"" he said. ""Worse off from the perspective of various crises becoming worse over time? That's a little more complex.""",bondbuyer.com,news,Bond Buyer,"Keeley Webster, Chip Barnett, Jennifer Shea",-0.1294117647058823,448829800,1,https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d57842/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4100x2306+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fab%2Ff2%2F66d62ba74db9815f115081ede8bd%2F398348215.jpg,

Nearly a million Canadians relied on gig work as their main source of income in 2022, according to a Statistics Canada report earlier in March, at a time when full-time jobs have become increasingly scarce and the cost of living has continued to squeeze everyday Canadians.

According to an H&R Block survey, 32 per cent of Canadian gig workers were willing to risk not declaring any of their gig-related income.

That builds off of the quarter of gig workers who admitted in the survey that they didn't report their gig-related income for last year as well.

The H&R Block survey, conducted by Angus Reid, polled 1,505 Canadians between Feb. 23 and 27 and has a margin of error of 2.5 per cent

""It's a criminal offence,"" Yannick Lemay, a tax expert with H&R Block, told the Star. ""We're required by law to declare all (our) income.""

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

It points to the complexities of filing taxes as a gig worker and the lack of understanding around the implications of not truthfully submitting income on a tax return, Lemay added.

The penalty varies depending on how many times a tax filer botches their income, or if the omission was intentional, he said, but for gig workers who lie about their gig-work income, that would be considered ""gross negligence.""

According to the Canada Revenue Agency, the penalty for false or omitted statements on a tax return could cost either $100 or 50 per cent of the understated tax.

Lemay's advice? ""Not to fear to file your taxes, because it will come sooner or later.""

Gig workers struggle with taxes, but lying is not widespread

""I appreciate the study H&R Block has done but what we've seen, those in the union, is a different story,"" Jennifer Scott, a bike courier and head of Gig Workers United, explained to the Star.

Most workers want to know how to do their taxes, Scott said. Some of the most well attended union events are their tax clinics, and, even when Scott was starting out as a courier, she was ""intimidated"" by the hurdles in putting together her return.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Part of that difficulty lies at the hands of the rideshare and delivery giants, ""who definitely do not make it easy for us to file our taxes,"" Scott explained. She described the onerous process for gig workers just to get information on how much they've earned or documents requiring for filing harmonized sales tax filings.

""Folks are going to feel anxiety, unnecessary anxiety, around whether or not they've been able to get all the correct information,"" Scott said.

How do I file taxes as a gig worker in Canada?

Gig workers in Canada need to report and pay tax on all self-employment income, according to the CRA, even on income earned outside the country.

Workers are also responsible for collecting and sending the goods and services tax / harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) to the CRA. For most workers, once they earn more than $30,000, that requirement kicks in. But, for rideshare drivers, Lemay warned, they need to register and collect GST/HST before they ever start driving.

That can all weigh on a gig worker's tax return, but claiming expenses can help to bring that down, Lemay said. Everything from the cost of advertising, fuel costs, insurance, motor vehicle expenses and telephone bills can be expensed, according to the CRA.

He also advised gig workers to keep their receipts for ""at least six years,"" in case of additional scrutiny from the CRA after filing.

""You should look at the tax return thinking, where can I make some savings regarding expenses?"" Lemay said.

""Not only the expenses related to your gig work, but also other expenses that may be tax deductible, so employment expenses, medical expenses, charitable donations that you've made during the year.""",thepeterboroughexaminer.com,news,thepeterboroughexaminer.com,,-0.3098039215686275,448829765,1,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thepeterboroughexaminer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ea/3eabfea7-5a2e-5888-9914-213f666dbbb8/65fdd20286439.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,

In a 6-1 vote, Woodstock politicians passed the municipality's 2024 budget at a meeting that lasted more than an hour longer than scheduled on Thursday night.

""This has been a grueling few months of putting this budget together,"" Mayor Jerry Acchione said in his closing remarks. ""Yes, we're going to make some tough decisions, but I hope you understand where they're coming from.""

Woodstock - a city of about 46,000 people - initially had a municipal budget proposed at about $98 million. That would've increased taxes by 4.86 per cent, adding $135 to the average home - ""average"" being one assessed at $267,000.

But after politicians added new projects, the 2024 spending plan swelled to more than $107 million. That means a 7.42 per cent tax hike for local property owners, or $206 on the average home's bill. It's significantly larger than Woodstock's 2023 tax hike of 4.32 per cent ($146 per average home).

Woodstock's 2024 tax hike is smaller than London's 8.7 per cent but larger than several others across the region. For example, the similarly sized St. Thomas, a city of about 39,000, kept its hike at 2.95 per cent, adding $88 to an average home assessed at $204,000.

But not everyone on Woodstock city council supported the budget.

Coun. Deb Tait, the lone holdout, thought the tax hike was too hefty. She told The London Free Press after the meeting: ""They're going to flip out when they get their tax bill.""

Tait also cited the approval of a streetscape project to revitalize Woodstock's downtown - a construction project to make upgrades such as adding new sidewalks and installing streetlights and furniture - as another reason she opposed the budget.

""I can't support a budget, any budget, that has the streetscape. . . . I can't do it,"" Tait said.

Council approved one phase of the project at a cost of $2.7 million at Thursday's meeting. The entire project would cost $7.4 million, although council can vote at a future meeting whether to proceed.

City politicians on Thursday approved several last-minute budget additions, including hiring 17 full-time staff and converting three part-time positions to full-time ones, adding a total of $800,000 to the 2024 spending plan.

""(I'm) absolutely comfortable with the approval of the full-time equivalent staff,"" Coun. Bernia Martin said following the meeting. ""We're growing exponentially as a city and many of our departments have not had new staff members added in decades.

""Paying more tax means that we are delivering services to the people who need it most in this community.""

After the meeting, Mayor Acchione said he understands nobody likes to pay more in taxes.

""As a resident of the City of Woodstock myself, and (as) a taxpayer, I understand the tax burden is on everybody,"" he said, adding that because Woodstock is ""continuing to grow even more this year and next,"" it's paramount to add additional staff.

The approved budget also contains several new initiatives from city hall including additional public transit hours, new physician recruitment efforts and boosting reserve funds for bridge and road reconstruction along with street lighting to alleviate the tax hikes in future years.

""I'm really proud of this council, and looking at each one individually,"" Acchione said.

March 22 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will make it easier for offshore wind developers to claim a subsidy for facilities planned in areas that have historically relied on fossil fuel industries for employment.

The revision follows nearly a year of warnings by offshore wind companies that their projects might not move forward without access to certain subsidies in President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Offshore wind is a critical part of Biden's plan to decarbonize the U.S. power grid and combat climate change, but projects have struggled due to soaring costs tied to inflation and higher interest rates and supply chain snags.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said it would now allow an offshore wind project to claim a tax credit for siting in low-income communities if supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment is located in such an area. SCADA systems are used to control critical infrastructure.

The energy communities tax credit is worth 10% of a project's cost and can be claimed on top of the IRA's base 30% credit for renewable energy projects.

The credit for siting projects in ""energy communities,"" defined as areas which have significant employment or tax revenues from fossil fuel industries and high unemployment, had been dictated by where a project connects to an onshore substation.

""This change reflects the fact that onshore SCADA equipment at ports is critical to offshore wind projects and that offshore wind projects make significant investments and create jobs at these ports over the duration of projects, which is the goal of the energy communities bonus,"" Treasury said in a statement.

The rules also clarify that projects with multiple points of interconnection may include any land-based power conditioning equipment to determine their eligibility for the bonus.

An industry group praised the change.

""In a move to bolster the transition from fossil fuel to clean energy, the eligibility expansion for the 10% Energy Communities credit creates an easier path to market for many offshore wind projects,"" Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, said in a statement.

Michigan State will face North Carolina in the second round of the tournament after the 9-seed Spartans handled Mississippi State and the 1-seed Tar Heels easily navigated past Wagner in the opening set of games. Michigan State (20-14) is looking for its second straight Sweet 16 appearance but will have to get through the top-seeded ACC regular season champions, who will be playing in their home state in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Michigan State and North Carolina's paths have crossed before in the tournament, which isn't all that surprising for two top programs that have regularly put together postseason runs in the last 20 years. Since 1999, when coach Tom Izzo MSU took MSU to the Final Four for the first time, MSU has had eight trips to the final weekend, while North Carolina has had seven in that time frame and three national titles.

MADE FOR MARCH: Tom Izzo and his Michigan State Spartans are at it again in March Madness

The previous tournament matchup happened on the biggest stage in the 2009 national championship hosted in Detroit. In total, the programs have met 16 times, with the first matchup coming in the 1957 Final Four. Here is a quick rundown of the history between Michigan State basketball and North Carolina before the 17th matchup.

Michigan State vs. North Carolina tournament history

Michigan State is 0-5 all-time in the NCAA tournament against North Carolina, with three of the five losses coming on the biggest stage.

The two schools first met in the tournament during the 1957 Final Four, with North Carolina winning, 74-70, in triple overtime. It was Michigan State's first-ever trip to the semifinals, led by the late Johnny Green, but the Tar Heels emerged victorious before beating Kansas in triple overtime for the school's first national title.

The next tournament matchup came in the 1998 Sweet 16, with North Carolina winning 73-58. It was the first trip to the tournament for MSU under Izzo, making it to the second weekend, but the Spartans fell behind early and failed to dig out of the hole. North Carolina was led by Vince Carter and Antwan Jamison, while a sophomore Mateen Cleaves led MSU with 18 points.

The next tournament matchup came during the 2005 Final Four, which ultimately ended in another North Carolina championship. As a 5-seed, Michigan State made a run to the Final Four with wins over Duke and Kentucky in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, but ran into a Carolina Blue buzzsaw in the Final Four. North Carolina trailed by five at half, but outscored MSU by 21 in the second half to win 87-71, then beat Illinois in the National Championship.

In 2007, the two teams met in the second round with the exact same seeds as this year, with North Carolina as a 1 and MSU as a 9. A younger version of the UNC team MSU would meet in the final two years later handled business, winning 81-67, led by Tyler Hansborough with 33 points.

The last time Michigan State and North Carolina met in the tournament, it ended with the Tar Heels adding another national championship trophy to their case and cutting down the banners on the elevated court on Ford Field in 2009. Michigan State went on a run as the 2-seed, taking down Kansas and Louisville in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight before facing 1-seed UConn in the Final Four to reach that point.

Michigan State stormed past the Huskies to reach the national championship in front of a home crowd, but North Carolina easily handled the Spartans in the first half en route to an 89-72 victory for the school's fifth of six championships.

Michigan State vs. North Carolina all-time history

Including the tournament matchups, Michigan State and North Carolina have played 16 times altogether, with the Spartans sporting a 4-12 record. Since 1999, when the Izzo era started getting rolling for MSU, the Spartans are 3-6 against the Tar Heels.

In 1958, MSU and North Carolina met in the regular season in the Dixie Classic in Raleigh, with MSU exacting revenge for the Final Four loss a year prior, winning 75-58. UNC won the next two matchups in the series in 1976 and '78 before another large gap between meetings. They met next in the 1995 Maui Invitational, with North Carolina winning by 22.

A year after falling to UNC in the Sweet 16, Michigan State won the 1999 game 86-76 on a December road trip to Chapel Hill, and followed up with a win in East Lansing, 77-64, in November 2000 in a home-and-home series in the Big Ten-ACC Challenge.

North Carolina won the next seven matchups, including the three tournament games in 2005, 2007 and 2009.

The revision follows nearly a year of warnings by offshore wind companies that their projects might not move forward without access to certain subsidies in President Joe Biden's landmark climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Offshore wind is a critical part of Biden's plan to decarbonize the U.S. power grid and combat climate change, but projects have struggled due to soaring costs tied to inflation and higher interest rates and supply chain snags.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said it would now allow an offshore wind project to claim a tax credit for siting in low-income communities if supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment is located in such an area. SCADA systems are used to control critical infrastructure.

The energy communities tax credit is worth 10% of a project's cost and can be claimed on top of the IRA's base 30% credit for renewable energy projects.

The credit for siting projects in ""energy communities,"" defined as areas which have significant employment or tax revenues from fossil fuel industries and high unemployment, had been dictated by where a project connects to an onshore substation.

""This change reflects the fact that onshore SCADA equipment at ports is critical to offshore wind projects and that offshore wind projects make significant investments and create jobs at these ports over the duration of projects, which is the goal of the energy communities bonus,"" Treasury said in a statement.

The rules also clarify that projects with multiple points of interconnection may include any land-based power conditioning equipment to determine their eligibility for the bonus.

An industry group praised the change.

""In a move to bolster the transition from fossil fuel to clean energy, the eligibility expansion for the 10% Energy Communities credit creates an easier path to market for many offshore wind projects,"" Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, said in a statement.

MUSKOGEE, OKLAHOMA - The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Oklahoma announced that Roslyn Melodie Haile, age 64, of Ardmore, Oklahoma, was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison for one count of Bank Fraud and one count of Tax Fraud, to be served concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, Haile was ordered to pay $428,271.26 in restitution to The MORE Foundation, and to pay an additional $120,777.02 in restitution to the IRS.

The charges arose from investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and IRS-Criminal Investigations.

On February 28, 2023, Haile entered a plea of guilty to an information of one count of bank fraud and one count of tax fraud. According to investigators, from 2017 until mid-2021, while employed as Executive Director of The MORE Foundation, a nonprofit that funds continuing education scholarships to Carter County high school graduates, Haile embezzled over $428,271.26 from the foundation's bank accounts for personal use. During that time, Haile embezzled funds through multiple different means, including bank transfers to pay off her personal credit card, ATM withdrawals, and the issuance of fraudulent payroll checks to herself. Haile also falsified a 2018 U.S. Individual Tax Return by underreporting personal income, resulting in a total loss of $120,777.02 to the U.S. Treasury. Based on these crimes, the court assessed Haile a total restitution of $591,761.28.

""As Executive Director of The MORE Foundation, Ms. Haile had the fundamental responsibility of managing scholarship funds efficiently, ethically, and with the upmost integrity. The students of Carter County and the generous donors deserve nothing less,"" said FBI Oklahoma City Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Gray. ""The FBI and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively pursue those who unlawfully enrich themselves at the expense of others.""

""The financial expertise of IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents was critical in detecting the illegal activity of Ms. Haile,"" said Christopher J. Altemus Jr., IRS:CI special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Office. ""She willfully stole money from an organization devoted to helping people obtain higher education and knowingly falsified her taxes to hide her ill-gotten gains. I'm proud of the diligent work done by members of CI along with the FBI to uncover her illegal actions and hold her accountable. Between what she embezzled from the non-profit and withheld from the IRS, she stole more than half a million dollars. In addition to time in jail, she is also required to pay restitution as part of her sentencing.""

""Fraud is not a victimless crime: Ms. Haile abused her position and plundered a fund she knew was intended to benefit Carter County's students and greater community,"" said United States Attorney Christopher J. Wilson. ""This office stands firm in its commitment to prosecute those who engage in predatory schemes, and I commend the work of FBI and IRS-CI agents whose investigations uncovered Ms. Haile's years-long theft.""

The Honorable John F. Heil, III, U.S. District Judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, presided over the hearing.

Assemblyman Charles Lavine introduced a bill that would throw out the law, which was enacted in 1907 in an effort to curb the number of divorces, the Associated Press reported. At the time, adultery was the only reason to authorize a divorce. Currently, the law makes adultery in the state a misdemeanor that can be punishable by up to three months in jail.

""This outdated statute criminalizes sexual behavior between consenting adults,"" Lavine said in a press release. ""It is long past time for us to remove it from the penal code. If a law is not enforced, there is no reason it should be maintained.""

Since 1972, only 13 people have been charged under the rarely used law, Lavine added, and of those charges, only five were ever convicted of the crime.

The law was nearly repealed in the 1960s, but when the changes were passed by the Assembly, a lawmaker from the chamber decided not to approve the changes due to concerns that it would appear as if the state was encouraging infidelity, according to a New York Times article.

Divorce on the basis of adultery can be challenging for a spouse to prove, as one cannot rely on just suspicion and would have to provide circumstantial evidence to the court.

New York is the latest state that is attempting to repeal such a law. States that already have done so include Colorado, New Hampshire, Idaho, and Utah. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Oklahoma all classify adultery as a felony offense.

Lavine's bill was overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly in a 137-10 vote, and it is headed to the state Senate, where it is likely to be passed before being signed by Gov.

Gig workers across the country are willing to risk tax fraud to try and keep more money in their pocket as cost-of-living weighs heavily on everyday Canadians, a new survey has found.

Nearly a million Canadians relied on gig work as their main source of income in 2022, according to a Statistics Canada report earlier in March, at a time when full-time jobs have become increasingly scarce and the cost of living has continued to squeeze everyday Canadians.

According to an H&R Block survey, 32 per cent of Canadian gig workers were willing to risk not declaring any of their gig-related income.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

That builds off of the quarter of gig workers who admitted in the survey that they didn't report their gig-related income for last year as well.

The H&R Block survey, conducted by Angus Reid, polled 1,505 Canadians between Feb. 23 and 27 and has a margin of error of 2.5 per cent

""It's a criminal offence,"" Yannick Lemay, a tax expert with H&R Block, told the Star. ""We're required by law to declare all (our) income.""

It points to the complexities of filing taxes as a gig worker and the lack of understanding around the implications of not truthfully submitting income on a tax return, Lemay added.

The penalty varies depending on how many times a tax filer botches their income, or if the omission was intentional, he said, but for gig workers who lie about their gig-work income, that would be considered ""gross negligence.""

According to the Canada Revenue Agency, the penalty for false or omitted statements on a tax return could cost either $100 or 50 per cent of the understated tax.

Lemay's advice? ""Not to fear to file your taxes, because it will come sooner or later.""

Gig workers struggle with taxes, but lying is not widespread

""I appreciate the study H&R Block has done but what we've seen, those in the union, is a different story,"" Jennifer Scott, a bike courier and head of Gig Workers United, explained to the Star.

Most workers want to know how to do their taxes, Scott said. Some of the most well attended union events are their tax clinics, and, even when Scott was starting out as a courier, she was ""intimidated"" by the hurdles in putting together her return.

Part of that difficulty lies at the hands of the rideshare and delivery giants, ""who definitely do not make it easy for us to file our taxes,"" Scott explained. She described the onerous process for gig workers just to get information on how much they've earned or documents requiring for filing harmonized sales tax filings.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

""Folks are going to feel anxiety, unnecessary anxiety, around whether or not they've been able to get all the correct information,"" Scott said.

How do I file taxes as a gig worker in Canada?

Gig workers in Canada need to report and pay tax on all self-employment income, according to the CRA, even on income earned outside the country.

Workers are also responsible for collecting and sending the goods and services tax / harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) to the CRA. For most workers, once they earn more than $30,000, that requirement kicks in. But, for rideshare drivers, Lemay warned, they need to register and collect GST/HST before they ever start driving.

That can all weigh on a gig worker's tax return, but claiming expenses can help to bring that down, Lemay said. Everything from the cost of advertising, fuel costs, insurance, motor vehicle expenses and telephone bills can be expensed, according to the CRA.

He also advised gig workers to keep their receipts for ""at least six years,"" in case of additional scrutiny from the CRA after filing.

""You should look at the tax return thinking, where can I make some savings regarding expenses?"" Lemay said.

Canada is aiming to cut emissions 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a steadily rising carbon price is a key part of the Liberals' climate plan. It is due to increase again on April 1 to C$80 ($59.13) a ton from C$65 a ton currently.

Trudeau's signature climate policy was introduced in 2019, but it has been opposed by most Canadian provinces. Last year, the government offered a three-year carbon tax exemption for home heating oil and higher carbon tax rebates for people in rural areas, to bring relief amid soaring costs of living.

What to do if you get a big tax refund,"More than 3.9M Canadians received an income tax refund between Feb. 8 and March 18 with an average value of $2,134

With tax season in full swing, many Canadians who are set to receive a return may be wondering what to do with that government cheque.

According to Statistics Canada, more than 3.9 million Canadians received an income tax refund between Feb. 8 and March 18 with an average value of $2,134. So, with that extra $2,000 in your pocket, is it time to buy that new TV you had your eye on, or be more prudent with the money?

Ryan Gubic, a certified financial planner and founder of MRG Wealth Management, says a tax refund can help jumpstart your financial goals for 2024.

""The tax return sometimes can be a great catalyst to think about the overall plan and all the different components of their financial life,"" Gubic said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Canada.

What the best course of action is for Canadians who receive a sizeable refund this year will largely depend on individual financial goals. Gubic says it's important to note that everyone's financial goals are different, so there's not one answer for where the money should go. Regardless of what your financial goals are, a portion of your tax return refund should be aligned with those goals, he says.

""Go back to your plan and go back to your vision,"" Gubic said. ""When I talk about vision with Canadians, it's what are you working towards what's success looks like for you.

""If they have a high interest rate on their mortgage right now, and one of their milestones or goals is to pay off their mortgage by a certain amount of time, using some or all of that tax refund as an additional payment towards your mortgage can be really beneficial.""

Wendy Brookhouse, a certified financial planner and CEO of Black Star Wealth, suggests Canadians spread their refund across a variety of accounts. But the first priority should be tackling outstanding debt. Consumer debt in Canada has surged amid higher interest rates, hitting $2.4 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to a recent report from TransUnion. After paying down debts, Brookhouse suggests a top-up of emergency reserves.

""If something happens to your job, if you become sick and couldn't work ... you have the money in cash (so) that you don't have to actually incur additional credit card debt or line of credit debt to fund certain aspects,"" she said.

Next, she would add money to the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) for those looking to buy their first home, and into a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) for those already with a home or not in the housing market. Brookhouse says the FHSA should be the first priority for those eligible to contribute, in part because there's an annual cap of $8,000. Both the FHSA and RRSP have the benefit of contributions being tax deductible, which can help ensure a taxpayer gets a return again next year.

Finally, she would consider adding money to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), which is easily accessible and where any income earned in the account is tax-free.

""That money will grow without paying tax on the growth and you can take it out tax-free when you need it,"" she said.

It may be tempting to take your refund and spend it on something you've been thinking about purchasing. Brookhouse says if someone doesn't have any high-interest debt and has plenty saved in an emergency fund, making a fun purchase with that tax return is OK.

""If either of those are not full up, I would minimize the splurge to a smaller percentage, because a splurge is immediate,"" she said.

""Make sure your financial foundation is very, very strong before you increase the allocation to the splurge.""

Gubic says it can be a good idea to use a tax return for those big necessary purchases, such as home renovations or new tires, but Canadians should be planning for these purchases beforehand, rather than relying on a big return to afford them.

If you are among the Canadians receiving a meaningful refund, Brookhouse suggests speaking with your employer to adjust your tax deductions to ensure you don't actually receive a big return again next year.

""If we think about it, a tax refund means we have lent money to the government, at zero per cent interest,"" she said.

""What we are going to do -- or recommend to do -- with the refund, you could be doing that all-year long instead.""

Ultimately, Brookhouse believes you're better off with that extra income in your pocket throughout the year. For example, more money in each paycheque can make it easier to tackle that looming debt.

""If you're actually able to increase your (debt) payment throughout the year, you could potentially reduce the amount of interest you're paying by doing bigger payments every month, as opposed to one big payment when you get your tax return back,"" Brookhouse said.",finance.yahoo.com,news,Yahoo!

In the same way that President Joe Biden makes former President Jimmy Carter's single term in office look like a rousing four-year success story, so current Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson must have some city residents longing for the days of Lightfoot's corona-related school closures and lockdowns (which she, of course, violated to get her hair done).

Lightfoot, however tyrannical her actions, seemed at least to know what she was doing. Johnson ... not so much.

Case in point: Johnson on Thursday blamed the failure of his ""Bring Chicago Home"" plan on Trump voters.

Under the plan, which the state's General Assembly refused to approve, real estate transfer taxes on properties valued at under $1 million would have been reduced slightly, from .75 percent to .6 percent, CBS News reported.

However, the tax rate on transactions of between $1 million and $1.5 million would have nearly tripled, to 2 percent, whereas transactions for more than $1.5 million would have quadrupled to 3 percent.

The purported plan for the increased revenue was to ""fight homelessness,"" according to CBS.

In what has become typical progressive rhetoric in the Trump era, the progressive mayor blamed Trump for his own failure to sell his progressive plan to his constituents, and seemed moreover to be setting up even more of a divide among the people he supposedly represents by setting the homeless and their advocates against Trump supporters as if there were no overlap between those two groups.

""Where we really have to organize,"" he said, ""are the communities who are most impacted.""

One could be forgiven for thinking that Johnson meant those folks whose tax rates would be quadrupled as the ""most impacted,"" but that doesn't appear to have been the case.

""Because it's also not lost on me, I think there were 38,000 Republicans that showed up and voted for Donald Trump, or something like that, in Chicago,"" he continued. ""That might be something to look into.

""I'll just say it: There's a good chance that that played a part in this referendum,"" he then said. ""So the same people who want to see Donald Trump ... be president again, those are the same voters who voted for him, are the same voters where you look at where there were more [votes against the referendum], they were concentrated there.""

You can watch Johnson's comments for yourself here.

Apparently, Johnson lives in the same fictional version of Chicago that disgraced actor Jussie Smollett does -- one in which supporters of former President Donald Trump roam the streets, beating up gay men, declaring the Windy City to be ""MAGA Country"" ... and ruining expensive progressive government plans to take over anything in its path, apparently.

He made this claim in Chicago, mind you, in Cook County, Illinois -- a county that voted for Biden over Trump in 2020 by more than 3-to-1, 74.22 percent to 24.01 percent.

As of Friday morning, the votes were still being counted, but ""Bring Chicago Home"" looked like it was going to wind up with something like 193,000 No votes versus maybe 167,000 or so Yes votes. (That's extrapolated from the 87 percent of the total votes, all that has been counted so far, according to data from The New York Times.)

Even if Johnson is right, and 38,000 Trump voters came out to vote against the referendum -- a highly dubious claim to begin with, and one for which Johnson has no real evidence -- that means that 155,000 or so non-Trump-supporting Chicago residents still voted against what CBS described as ""a marquee initiative of Mayor Brandon Johnson and his progressive allies on the City Council.""

And that doesn't even take into account the fact that Johnson, to the degree that his claim has any validity, was actually complimenting the Trump voters in question, most of whom would be delighted to take credit for helping to crush this huge tax-and-spend effort.

""It's certainly a pump to the brakes on the mayor's agenda,"" city Alderman Brendan Reilly, who opposed the plan in part because Chicago already spends $200 million annually on homelessness, told CBS. ""It's been aggressive against the business community here, and some say we have a hostile business environment in Chicago as a result.""

""There is also a bigger question looming -- is this the first signal that voters are beginning to reverse course against the progressive wave of Democratic politics in Chicago that swept Mayor Johnson into office last year,"" CBS asked in its report.

Regular readers of The Western Journal will remember that Lightfoot performed so poorly as mayor that she didn't even qualify to compete in the runoff election last year, making her the first incumbent mayor of Chicago to fail to win re-election in four decades.

But if Johnson keeps up like this, he might end up making her look competent, if only by comparison.",ijr.com,news,IJR,,-0.06666666666666665,448828033,1,https://ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1490409246.jpg,

The Inflation Reduction Act required tax credit recipients to provide their workers with good pay and apprenticeships to build the future of the clean energy workforce

In letter, Senators press Department of Treasury to make the process of obtaining tax credits as smooth and efficient as possible

Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) led a group of his colleagues in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the Biden Administration to adopt rules that facilitate smooth implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act's prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship tax credits. The tax credits are intended to provide tens of thousands of electricians, metalworkers, welders, and other workers with good pay, training, and apprenticeships to build the clean energy workforce pipeline for the next generation. In the letter, the Senators press the Administration to make the process of receiving these tax credits smooth and efficient so that the law can reach its full potential.

The Senators wrote, ""The purpose of the IRA credits is to not only spur the creation of new clean, affordable energy, but to employ tens of thousands of electricians, metalworkers, welders and other workers in high-paying jobs, with training and apprenticeships to build the pipeline of workers for the next generation. We write today to encourage the Treasury to adopt rules that empower workers, raise wages, and set our workers up for success for years to come.""

In the letter, the Senators made several recommendations to ensure that clean energy workers are able to take full advantage of the new IRA tax credits. Those recommendations include treating project labor agreements as evidence of compliance with the IRA's prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, establishing a front-end compliance monitoring system, and strengthening the good faith effort exception to PWA requirements.

Senator Casey fought to include clean energy tax credits in the IRA. Since the bill's passage, he has consistently advocated to ensure that Pennsylvania workers can take full advantage of the tax credits included in the bill.

The letter was signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Corey Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Laphonza Butler (D-CA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Durbin (D-IL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Edward Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).

We are writing regarding the Treasury Department's proposed rulemaking to implement the prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship (PWA) requirements permitting taxpayers to claim increased tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA expanded several clean energy tax credits and provided for increased amounts for taxpayers who meet the law's PWA standards. The purpose of the IRA credits is to not only spur the creation of new clean, affordable energy, but to employ tens of thousands of electricians, metalworkers, welders and other workers in high-paying jobs, with training and apprenticeships to build the pipeline of workers for the next generation. We write today to encourage the Treasury to adopt rules that empower workers, raise wages, and set our workers up for success for years to come.

The PWA bonus credit is the most important labor provision in the IRA, and effective implementation of these standards is critical to ensure that the IRA creates the high-quality, good-paying jobs that Congress intended. To claim the full IRA tax credits, taxpayers must ensure that workers are paid the prevailing wage as determined by the Department of Labor (DOL). Additionally, the apprenticeship utilization standards require qualifying taxpayers to employ apprentices from registered apprenticeship programs for a certain number of hours, among other requirements.

It can be difficult and time-consuming for agencies to certify that a taxpayer has met these conditions. That is why we urge the Treasury to adopt the following commonsense recommendations that will shift compliance to the front end and rely more heavily on workers and their representatives. These suggestions will ensure that the award of bonus tax credits goes to companies who have set out to comply with the law, made a good faith effort to fulfill the conditions of the law, and whose compliance can be verified by workers on the ground through project labor agreements to the extent practical. To that end, we urge Treasury to adopt the following recommendations in its final PWA rule:

Taxpayers should be able to demonstrate compliance with the IRA's prevailing wage and apprenticeship utilization requirements by presenting evidence that all construction work at a Qualified Facility was completed under a Project Labor Agreement (PLA), using the definition of PLAs as included in the comments submitted by North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU). A taxpayer that certifies to the Treasury Department that construction work on a Qualified Facility is subject to a PLA should be entitled to a presumption of compliance, given that PLAs (1) ensure that construction workers receive wages at or above the local prevailing wage, (2) promote the employment of registered apprentices on the project, and (3) provide for labor standards enforcement through a grievance procedure. Allowing PLAs to show compliance with these rules is the best way to simplify the compliance process for taxpayers and the Treasury.

Treasury's proposed rule relies heavily on records retention, and while important, records retention alone is insufficient to ensure compliance. Therefore, we urge Treasury to adopt the framework of DOL's existing Davis-Bacon compliance monitoring system while also requiring that taxpayers who intend to claim a bonus credit based on labor standards compliance notify Treasury before construction begins or shortly thereafter.

For example, Treasury should require taxpayers to ensure that all solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for construction on qualifying projects include provisions describing the applicable labor standards to ensure that contractors, at all tiers, are on notice of their obligations. Workers should also receive notice early on of their right to a prevailing wage. Without direct front-end notice, there will be no way for workers to know what they are entitled to, and whether they are being shorted. To this end, taxpayers should be required to post Davis-Bacon posters and the applicable wage schedules throughout the job site, including all designated entrances where workers and the general public can see them. Taxpayers must also ensure that each construction worker is provided a written notice identifying the worker's classification and the proper prevailing wage rate to which they are entitled. Relatedly, Treasury should require that taxpayers who plan to claim enhanced credits for labor standards compliance notify Treasury of that intent before construction begins through Treasury's pre-filing registration system. In this way, Treasury will be able to identify early on those projects subject to labor standards, and to monitor and audit those projects for compliance.

Taxpayers should also be required to collect weekly certified payroll reports from their contractors, as well as periodic apprentice labor hour reports for review and transmission to Treasury. This process is critical for verifying that contractors and subcontractors are paying the prevailing wage and meeting their apprentice utilization requirements. The certified payroll process has been consistently applied to a wide range of federal and federally assisted projects for over 60 years, as well as state public works projects covered by state prevailing wage laws.

Treasury must also establish a complaint procedure that aggrieved workers can use to report noncompliance and an office dedicated to enforcement. To that end, Treasury should create a designated Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, which should partner with the Department of Labor on enforcement efforts.

Taxpayers should also be required to pre-file an intended labor plan with the Treasury and with the Department of Labor, explaining how they will fulfill the requirements of the IRA, including pay rates, hours worked for applicable workers and their apprenticeship utilization plan.

Treasury should also clarify that aggrieved workers on covered projects are protected by anti-retaliation provisions.

We urge Treasury to adopt several changes to ensure the Good Faith Effort Exception for the taxpayers' apprenticeship utilization requirement better captures situations where entities have truly acted in good faith:

Treasury should also impose key affirmative obligations on taxpayers under the good faith effort exception to facilitate development of a strategic plan that would enable taxpayers to comply with the three separate prongs of the Apprenticeship Requirements: Labor Hours, Participation, and Ratios. We recommend inclusion of the following affirmative obligations:

Effective implementation of the IRA is critical to ensuring the success of this law, and we appreciate your consideration of these recommendations.

Stepping Up Efforts to Squash Fraud in Tax Credit Program,"Alan Rappeport covers the Treasury Department and has been tracking how pandemic relief money has been spent.

The software was called ""Tax Bandits."" The scheme, which was run out of a prison in California, attempted to fraudulently claim more than half a billion dollars in tax refunds.

The method was a familiar one: erroneous claims of the Employee Retention Tax Credit.

The I.R.S. said on Friday that it was intensifying its efforts to root out such cases of fraud as it tries to safeguard taxpayer money, but it acknowledged that without an intervention by Congress, the agency would continue to be flooded with potentially improper claims.

One of the most brazen cases of alleged fraud in the program emerged in February, when the federal agents announced charges against the ringleader of an operation led by Kristopher Thomas, a former gang member who was already serving prison time for murder. He was charged along with seven co-conspirators outside prison, including his mother, who were helping to carry out the plan, authorities said.

The joint investigation by the F.B.I. and the criminal investigation unit of the Internal Revenue Service was called ""Operation Fraud Street Mafia."" It involved intercepted calls and text messages exchanging information about fake businesses while using the money that they made to live luxuriously -- even flying on a private jet to a party in Las Vegas.

The alleged plot is perhaps the most egregious example of the abuse of tax benefit that was created in during the throes of the pandemic to keep businesses and their workers afloat. Since its inception in 2020, a new industry of tax preparation firms have popped up just to process claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which allows businesses to collect up to $26,000 for each employee on payroll.

But the program has been rife with fraud, with many of those tax prep firms luring businesses to apply for tax credits that they are not qualified to receive.

Rep. Dave Joyce (R-OH), co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, asked the Treasury Secretary at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing about the years-long banking issues facing legal cannabis companies. ""Can you tell me what is presently this administration's position on"" the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act?

""I think we would potentially welcome legislation in this area that would clarify for banks what their responsibilities are,"" Yellen replied, reported Reuters. ""The fact that marijuana is outlawed by the federal government creates an impediment to (banks') willingness to provide banking services, services to cannabis firms, and it creates all the problems that you're familiar with.""

Rep. Joyce attended the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Miami in 2023. Other essential politicians such as Rep. Ed Perlmutter and Sen. Cory Gardner will be with Benzinga for this year's event, April 16-17, 2024.

Yellen did not specify which provisions she viewed as crucial for such legislation nor did she comment on the September 2023 milestone approval of the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. The bill is meant to enable legal cannabis businesses access to banks and financial institutions, which up to now have been off limits as banks are not only prohibited by federal law from dealing with cannabis in that it is a Schedule I drug, but they're also concerned about accusations of money laundering. These restrictions have forced the cannabis industry to deal on a cash-only basis, resulting in dangerous, even deadly armed robberies.

""I think legislation may be necessary to raise the comfort level that banks have in doing this business,"" Yellen said.

Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer from Maryland offered to help Yellen and Republican colleagues in passing such legislation because the current situation is putting businesses and employees at risk.

""We're putting people in a very vulnerable position where they have large amounts of cash. We're encouraging criminals to break into businesses that deal in cannabis,"" Hoyer said. ""I am neither a user nor suggester of using, but the fact of the matter is every state that's voted on it has made it legal, and I appreciate your work and whatever I can do to help you on there.""

But the winnings you'd take home could vary by as much as $106 million depending on where you bought your ticket, due to state taxes.

Federal taxes are the same for everyone. Winnings are taxed 24% upfront, although the total tax bill will almost certainly be 37% when you actually file, since you'll likely be in the highest tax bracket.

In contrast, taxes on lottery winnings vary widely between U.S. states. They typically range from 3% to 6%, but go up to 10.9% in New York -- the most charged by any state participating in the lottery.

However, eight states don't levy taxes on lottery winnings at all:

If you live in any of these states, you will take home the highest payout possible. That means either $294,251,812 as a cash lump sum or a 30-year annuity totaling $616,764,360, according to usamega.com.

The lump sum payout in these states is $50.2 million more in than in New York, the most-taxed state.

Where you buy the ticket matters, too, as a winning ticket bought outside your home state could trigger taxes for the state in which the ticket was purchased. Generally speaking, your home state will require you to report out-of-state winnings, but will offer a credit or deduction for taxes already paid to a non-resident state.

That means if you live in California, but purchase a winning ticket in Oregon -- which has state tax of 8% on jackpot winnings -- your take-home amount would be worth about $46 million less than if you had purchased the ticket at home in California, which doesn't charge state taxes on jackpots.

If you do happen to win the jackpot, consider hiring a tax professional. They can help you navigate the tax implications, including the best choice of payout and whether you owe out-of-state taxes.

""All our bank accounts have been frozen. We can do no campaign work, we cannot support our workers, we cannot support our candidates. This has been done two months before the election campaign.

He further said that the party has already lost a month fighting the IT case and its ability to fight elections has been damaged.

""This is not freezing of Congress party's bank accounts; this is the freezing of Indian democracy. As the biggest opposition party, we are unable to take any action - we can't book advertisements or send our leaders anywhere. This is an assault on democracy,"" he added.

Michigan State will face North Carolina in the second round of the tournament after the 9-seed Spartans handled Mississippi State and the 1-seed Tar Heels easily navigated past Wagner in the opening set of games. Michigan State (20-14) is looking for its second straight Sweet 16 appearance but will have to get through the top-seeded ACC regular season champions, who will be playing in their home state in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Michigan State and North Carolina's paths have crossed before in the tournament, which isn't all that surprising for two top programs that have regularly put together postseason runs in the last 20 years. Since 1999, when coach Tom Izzo MSU took MSU to the Final Four for the first time, MSU has had eight trips to the final weekend, while North Carolina has had seven in that time frame and three national titles.

The previous tournament matchup happened on the biggest stage in the 2009 national championship hosted in Detroit. In total, the programs have met 16 times, with the first matchup coming in the 1957 Final Four. Here is a quick rundown of the history between Michigan State basketball and North Carolina before the 17th matchup.

FOLLOW THE MADNESS: NCAA tournament brackets, scores, schedules, teams and more.

Michigan State vs. North Carolina tournament history

Michigan State is 0-5 all-time in the NCAA tournament against North Carolina, with three of the five losses coming on the biggest stage.

The two schools first met in the tournament during the 1957 Final Four, with North Carolina winning, 74-70, in triple overtime. It was Michigan State's first-ever trip to the semifinals, led by the late Johnny Green, but the Tar Heels emerged victorious before beating Kansas in triple overtime for the school's first national title.

The next tournament matchup came in the 1998 Sweet 16, with North Carolina winning 73-58. It was the first trip to the tournament for MSU under Izzo, making it to the second weekend, but the Spartans fell behind early and failed to dig out of the hole. North Carolina was led by Vince Carter and Antwan Jamison, while a sophomore Mateen Cleaves led MSU with 18 points.

The next tournament matchup came during the 2005 Final Four, which ultimately ended in another North Carolina championship. As a 5-seed, Michigan State made a run to the Final Four with wins over Duke and Kentucky in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, but ran into a Carolina Blue buzzsaw in the Final Four. North Carolina trailed by five at half, but outscored MSU by 21 in the second half to win 87-71, then beat Illinois in the National Championship.

In 2007, the two teams met in the second round with the exact same seeds as this year, with North Carolina as a 1 and MSU as a 9. A younger version of the UNC team MSU would meet in the final two years later handled business, winning 81-67, led by Tyler Hansborough with 33 points.

The last time Michigan State and North Carolina met in the tournament, it ended with the Tar Heels adding another national championship trophy to their case and cutting down the banners on the elevated court on Ford Field in 2009. Michigan State went on a run as the 2-seed, taking down Kansas and Louisville in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight before facing 1-seed UConn in the Final Four to reach that point.

Michigan State stormed past the Huskies to reach the national championship in front of a home crowd, but North Carolina easily handled the Spartans in the first half en route to an 89-72 victory for the school's fifth of six championships.

Michigan State vs. North Carolina all-time history

Including the tournament matchups, Michigan State and North Carolina have played 16 times altogether, with the Spartans sporting a 4-12 record. Since 1999, when the Izzo era started getting rolling for MSU, the Spartans are 3-6 against the Tar Heels.

In 1958, MSU and North Carolina met in the regular season in the Dixie Classic in Raleigh, with MSU exacting revenge for the Final Four loss a year prior, winning 75-58. UNC won the next two matchups in the series in 1976 and '78 before another large gap between meetings. They met next in the 1995 Maui Invitational, with North Carolina winning by 22.

A year after falling to UNC in the Sweet 16, Michigan State won the 1999 game 86-76 on a December road trip to Chapel Hill, and followed up with a win in East Lansing, 77-64, in November 2000 in a home-and-home series in the Big Ten-ACC Challenge.

North Carolina won the next seven matchups, including the three tournament games in 2005, 2007 and 2009. In 2008, the two met in the Big Ten-ACC challenge, with North Carolina winning by 35 in Detroit. In December 2009 following the National Championship, MSU lost by seven in a road matchup. In 2011, the two teams played each other in the Carrier Classic, with the game taking place on a Naval aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean, and North Carolina won by 12. They have met twice in the non-conference since then, with North Carolina winning by 14 in 2013 and Michigan State winning by 18 in the most recent matchup in 2017 in the PK80 Invitational.",freep.com,news,Detroit Free Press,Jared Ramsey,0.2,448827229,1,"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/presto/2022/11/10/PDTF/3dffa212-85e6-42e0-a55d-d0e9c9125212-DFP_1204_msu_nc.jpg_1_1_FP5QUVFP_L327926519.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x1,y261&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",eng-9412763

They include tutors, graphic designers, hair stylists, and all kinds of independent and self-employed workers, along with merchants who sell products online through Etsy, eBay, Amazon and other sites. But tax law is still catching up when it comes to how best to report this income.

If you're a freelancer or gig worker who receives payments via apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or PayPal, your tax reporting requirements will change for the 2024 tax year. The law will not affect the amount of taxes owed, but it will change how you report income with 1099-K forms.

The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed. The tax filing deadline is April 15.

For the current tax year, freelancers and small business owners still only need to use 1099-K forms to report third-party app payments totaling $20,000, and any number of payments above 200. But beginning next year, that threshold will be just $5,000, which will eventually be lowered to $600. The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed.

Some in the space say the new law will benefit both freelancers and the IRS by improving information gathering, especially for people who are self-employed and merchants who sell online.

Freelancers, gig workers, and online sellers owe taxes on their income regardless of whether they meet the reporting threshold to use 1099-K forms, but it can be difficult to keep track of every payment, especially across sites and apps. This can lead to confusion and underpayment, experts say.

The eventual change will affect platforms, businesses, and individuals, and it's good to begin preparing now. Here's what you need to know:

WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET READY FOR THE NEW 1099-K REPORTING THRESHOLD?

If you're already keeping accurate track of your income from freelancing as paid via Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, PayPal, and other sites, you're in good shape. The main difference will be that these platforms will issue you additional forms for every transaction. This should make correct reporting to the IRS even easier, though there will be more paperwork.

Currently, if someone paying a freelancer via Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp sends a form to the IRS reporting that pay, but the freelancer doesn't report the income with the same form, that creates a ""matching error"" for the agency. The change will ensure both that taxpayers receive proper refunds and that the IRS receives proper payment.

WHAT IF I MISTAKENLY RECEIVE A 1099-K FORM?

In some cases, in part due to the changing guidance, platforms may send taxpayers 1099-K Forms in error this year -- such as for transactions between family and friends or for expense sharing between roommates, according to the IRS.

The first thing to do is try to get an updated form by contacting the company that issued the form incorrectly. If you can't get one in a timely manner, the IRS says to zero out the income on your tax return with the description ""Form 1099-K Received in Error."" The line appears on Form 1040 - Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. There, you should write, as follows: ""Part I - Line 8z - Other Income - Form 1099-K Received in Error.""

WHY DID THE IRS DELAY IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGE FOR A SECOND YEAR IN A ROW?

The change, which had been set to take effect this year, was delayed again in November. The IRS decided to give taxpayers another year to adjust to the new reporting requirements.

""Taking this phased-in approach is the right thing to do for the purposes of tax administration, and it prevents unnecessary confusion,"" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in November. ""It's clear that an additional delay for tax year 2023 will avoid problems for taxpayers, tax professionals and others in this area.""

WHAT ADVICE AND GUIDANCE DOES THE IRS HAVE FOR FREELANCERS?

The IRS has an online Gig Economy Tax Center that focuses specifically on the tax questions and needs of freelancers and other workers in the informal economy. The site addresses common concerns and pitfalls.

WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE REPORTING INCOME ON 1099-K FORMS?

The IRS will be in touch if they see discrepancies between income reported on 1099-K forms by taxpayers and companies issuing the forms, both this year and next. It's important to keep in mind that income from all platforms, including things like YouTube ads and Patreon subscriptions, must be reported in this way.

One way to make sure all income is accurately captured is to be sure to transfer all payments from your PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts to a traditional bank account, rather than keeping it on third-party platforms.",neworleanscitybusiness.com,news,New Orleans CityBusiness,Associated Press,0.07450980392156858,448827182,1,https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2024/03/5.-AP24081652218602.jpg,

""I used to get a happy birthday text from my mum every year ... and now I've gone public, they've been told not to have anything to do with me at all,"" he said.

The purpose of the PBCC's ""ecosystem"", as stated in internal documents sighted by this masthead, is to ""maintain the Community's lifecycle"", but particularly to provide funding for the Brethren's schools which are reserved for the church's students.

Ordinary Brethren individuals and businesses are strongly encouraged to spend their money with companies run by the church leaders, such as consulting firm Universal Business Team (UBT).

Documents produced for a recent ""Strive"" forum to advertise these projects to the PBCC's flock say UBT turns over up to $500 million a year. The profits, according to the documents, are ""invested in"" 124 Plymouth Brethren schools and other charities such as public-facing charity the Rapid Relief Team.

But one insider, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said the commercial enterprises appeared to make considerably more money than was distributed to the charities.

""I think the Tax Office will be looking at where all the money actually goes.""

The insider said UBT charges Brethren businesses between $30,000 and $150,000 for two hours of consulting, but most of the consultants are working for free ""thinking they're doing it for the testimony of Bruce Hales"", meaning the gross profits of the business were about 80 per cent.

In the recent ""Strive"" forum the ecosystem's purpose was said to be ""striving towards securing our financial future so we can fund our way of life, indefinitely"". UBT, whose offices were raided, is described in the documents as ""our parent company"".

""Our leadership team comprises members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and professionals from the wider community,"" the documents say.

It is also the central company from which members rent phones and computers. These are fitted with Brethren approved software, including a program called Streamline 3 which means UBT administrators can monitor the browsing history and GPS location of Brethren members and remotely capture images of their screen.

One of the charities funded by the ecosystem, the Rapid Relief Team (RRT), is described by Woodbury as an attempt to rehabilitate the Brethren's poor global reputation, and to help its lobbying of politicians.

In a recent Brethren conference, Strive 23, one of the Rapid Relief Team's aims for the year was that: ""Every locality to engage with a person of influence or status at a local level"".

Woodbury, a former Rapid Relief Team volunteer, said it seemed to be a ""cleverly co-ordinated PR instrument"" of the church.

Other charities are set up, some with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of funds, with the ability to give loans for housing, to fund Brethren travel for religious meetings, and to help the Brethren poor. Though many are constituted to help the ""general community in Australia"", the only beneficiaries are members of their own church.

The Brethren are also establishing their own supermarkets, Campus and Co. Many stores are based on the school grounds and they are staffed by unpaid Brethren women and charge a premium to the flock for their groceries. Brethren members are expected to make a certain percentage of their weekly purchases through Campus and Co.

Bruce Hales, who has led the church since his father died in 2003, has become increasingly wealthy in recent years, as have his sons.

In 2022, this masthead reported that Gareth Hales bought a two-hectare, $9.5 million house in the NSW holiday destination of Dural, set behind a gated entry with a tennis court, heated swimming pool and a golf driving range.

A few months earlier, Nerolie Hales, the wife of Dean, spent $7.5 million buying a 4116 square metre home in Epping, in Sydney's north-western suburbs. And another senior Brethren man, Gavin Grace, of Ballarat, broke the Dural house price record, paying $14 million for a resort-style mansion, which he bought without a mortgage.

The New Daily reported last year that Gareth and Charles Hales were suppliers for more than $1 billion worth of contracts for COVID-19 personal protective equipment in the UK via Unispace Global Limited, and Dean Hales was linked to a network of companies that won more than $30 million in government contracts to supply COVID tests to Australian governments.

And a Brethren company, Westlab Pty Ltd, owned by another senior Brethren man, Gavin Grace, won tenders with the Department of Health between August 2020 and August 2022 worth a combined $106 million to supply rapid antigen tests.

Bruce Hales, who is an accountant, was listed as the ""independent auditor"" on Westlab's accounts.

Its report was published on February 26 (Section 103 Organization Designation Authorizations [ODA] for Transport Airplanes Expert Panel Review Report, FAA, February 26, 2024). It may seem astonishing that US legislation requires manufacturers to regulate themselves, but it's understandable: The complexity of an aircraft is such that the FAA, which has limited resources, can't be asked to do everything without missing something.

Having representatives hold independent supervisory roles within the company, even if they are paid by it, means working hand in hand toward the same objective: safety. At least, that's the theory...

Expertise spread too thinly across the company's sites

The supervisory function at Boeing is indeed separate from the rest of the company. It's well staffed, with 1,000 employees, integrated into the regulatory department under a ""chief aerospace safety officer."" It can conduct compliance tests and approve plans. But the FAA has observed a general decline in skills, as in the engineering and manufacturing departments.

Seasoned personnel apparently left the company during Covid-19, or retired. Expertise is spread too thinly across the company's various sites. Nothing is in place to coordinate, pool and disseminate this expertise. Some members of the engineering team feel isolated and unsupported, without mentoring or knowledge-sharing initiatives.

This is particularly unfortunate given the recruitment difficulties in the aerospace industry. The transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next has been compromised. Experts are taking on more and more of the FAA's delegated functions. This means less time spent on training junior control engineers, who will say ""yes"" faster, too fast, in the first round of checks.

No clear channel

Human factors are being neglected. They are essential because it's always a pilot at the controls of an aircraft. Their feedback during testing isn't always escalated all the way up the ladder and factoring in their opinions depends on the responsiveness of the individuals at the upper level. The report does not challenge the competence of the pilots employed by Boeing - on the contrary.

Still, the ""chief pilot"" who heads them does not hold an equivalent hierarchical position to the ""chief engineer."" Managers responsible for investigating feedback from their team members are also the ones who will evaluate them (for promotions, salary increases, etc...). No wonder employees are reluctant to raise problems. There's no clear channel for reporting safety issues.",lemonde.fr,news,Le Monde.fr,Charles Cuvelliez,0.0117647058823529,448826933,1,https://img.lemde.fr/2024/03/01/193/0/4532/2266/1440/720/60/0/a034341_2024-03-01t205046z-1471320205-rc27d6a4f4mk-rtrmadp-3-spirit-aerosystm-m-a-boeing-production.JPG,

This initiative, aimed at mitigating the city's massive food waste problem, also brings to light the critical role of public-private partnerships in fostering environmental stewardship. Below, we explore the benefits of New York's composting plan, its implications for global food waste management, and how businesses can support and benefit from such green initiatives.

New York, generating 11,000 tons of waste daily, with a third comprising food and yard scraps, has embarked on a mission to reduce its ecological footprint. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) reports that only three percent of total waste was reclaimed last year through organic recycling methods. However, New York is setting a new standard in waste management with the city's latest initiative, which includes the introduction of brown and orange collection bins and the mandate of food waste sorting by 2024.

The expansion of the city's largest composting facility on Staten Island, equipped with an aerated static pile composting method, is a testament to the potential of technological advancements in enhancing efficiency. This method, reducing decomposition time by half, enables the facility to process up to 95,000 tons of organic waste annually. Furthermore, integrating ""smart bins,"" Bluetooth-enabled garbage cans, underscores the importance of convenience and accessibility in encouraging public participation in composting efforts.

The transition to a large-scale composting system has been challenging, particularly for existing community-based composting organizations facing funding cuts. Yet, this scenario also highlights the crucial role of private sector involvement in sustaining environmental initiatives. For instance, Mill, a food waste management startup, extended a $350,000 donation to Big Reuse, demonstrating how private funds can temporarily bridge funding gaps and underscore the shared responsibility of waste management.

Businesses have an opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the urban composting movement. By investing in or partnering with composting programs, companies not only aid in diverting organic waste from landfills but also enhance their corporate social responsibility (CSR) profile. Furthermore, businesses can foster a culture of sustainability within their operations and among their customers by advocating for and practicing waste reduction and recycling.

New York's ambitious composting plan is more than just a local initiative; it's a blueprint for cities worldwide to follow in addressing the pressing issue of food waste. The program's success hinges on collaboration across government, private sector, and community organizations. Businesses, in particular, play a pivotal role in this ecosystem, providing essential support through funding, innovation, and advocacy.

Companies can lead by example; embracing composting and sustainability demonstrates that environmental responsibility and business success are not mutually exclusive. By integrating such practices into their operations, they contribute to a healthier planet and tap into the consumer demand for eco-friendly products and services.

New York's journey towards becoming a national model in environmental stewardship is a clarion call for businesses to support and engage in sustainable waste management practices.",environmentenergyleader.com,news,Environment+Energy Leader,Kaleigh Harrison,-0.1058823529411764,448826811,1,https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Compost_yellow_bucket-1024x682.jpg,eng-9414913

Ordinary Brethren individuals and businesses are strongly encouraged to spend their money with companies run by the church leaders, such as consulting firm Universal Business Team (UBT).

Documents produced for a recent ""Strive"" forum to advertise these projects to the PBCC's flock say UBT turns over up to $500 million a year. The profits, according to the documents, are ""invested in"" 124 Plymouth Brethren schools and other charities such as public-facing charity the Rapid Relief Team.

But one insider, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said the commercial enterprises appeared to make considerably more money than was distributed to the charities.

""I think the Tax Office will be looking at where all the money actually goes.""

The insider said UBT charges Brethren businesses between $30,000 and $150,000 for two hours of consulting, but most of the consultants are working for free ""thinking they're doing it for the testimony of Bruce Hales"", meaning the gross profits of the business were about 80 per cent.

In the recent ""Strive"" forum the ecosystem's purpose was said to be ""striving towards securing our financial future so we can fund our way of life, indefinitely"". UBT, whose offices were raided, is described in the documents as ""our parent company"".

""Our leadership team comprises members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and professionals from the wider community,"" the documents say.

It is also the central company from which members rent phones and computers.

One of the charities funded by the ecosystem, the Rapid Relief Team (RRT), is described by Woodbury as an attempt to rehabilitate the Brethren's poor global reputation, and to help its lobbying of politicians.

In a recent Brethren conference, Strive 23, one of the Rapid Relief Team's aims for the year was that: ""Every locality to engage with a person of influence or status at a local level"".

Woodbury, a former Rapid Relief Team volunteer, said it seemed to be a ""cleverly co-ordinated PR instrument"" of the church.

Other charities are set up, some with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of funds, with the ability to give loans for housing, to fund Brethren travel for religious meetings, and to help the Brethren poor. Though many are constituted to help the ""general community in Australia"", the only beneficiaries are members of their own church.

The Brethren are also establishing their own supermarkets, Campus and Co. Many stores are based on the school grounds and they are staffed by unpaid Brethren women and charge a premium to the flock for their groceries. Brethren members are expected to make a certain percentage of their weekly purchases through Campus and Co.

Bruce Hales, who is an accountant, was listed as the ""independent auditor"" on Westlab's accounts.

A team of miniature drones recently entered the radioactive ruins of one of Fukushima's nuclear reactors in an attempt to help Japanese officials continue planning their decades' long cleanup effort. But if the images released earlier this week didn't fully underscore just how much work is still needed, new footage from the tiny robots' excursion certainly highlights the many challenges ahead.

On Thursday, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO), the Japanese utility organization that oversees the Fukushima Daiichi plant reclamation project, revealed three-minutes of video recorded by a bread slice-sized flying drone alongside a snake-like bot that provided its light. Obtained during TEPCO's two-day probe, the new clip offers viewers some of the best looks yet at what remains of portions of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility -- specifically, the main structural support in its No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel.

The Fukushima plant suffered a catastrophic meltdown on March 11, 2011, after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the Japanese coast produced a 130-foot-tall tsunami that subsequently bore down on the region. Of the three reactors damaged during the disaster, No. 1 is considered the most severely impacted. A total of 880 tons of molten radioactive fuel debris is believed to remain within those reactors, with No.1 believed to contain the largest amount. An estimated 160,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding areas, with only limited returns allowed the following year. Around 20,000 people are believed to have been killed during the tsunami itself.

Last week's drone-gathered images and video show the remains of the No. 1 reactor's control-rod drive mechanism, alongside other equipment attached to the core, which indicate the parts were dislodged during the meltdown. According to NHK World, ""agglomerated or icicle-shaped objects"" seen in certain areas could be nuclear fuel debris composed of ""a mixture of molten nuclear fuel and surrounding devices.""

Experts say only a fraction of the damage could be accessed by the drones due to logistical difficulties, and that the robots couldn't reach the core bottom because of poor visibility. Similarly, radiation levels could not be ascertained during this mission, since the drones did not include instruments such as dosimeters so as to remain light enough to maneuver through the plant.

TEPCO now plans to analyze the drone data to better establish a plan of action to collect and remove the radioactive debris within Fukushima. In August 2023, officials began a multiphase project to release treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the Pacific Ocean. While deemed safe by multiple agencies and watchdogs, the ongoing endeavor has received strong pushback from neighboring countries, including China.

The Japanese government and TEPCO have previously estimated cleanup will take 30-40 years, although critics believe the timeline to be extremely optimistic.",popsci.com,news,Popular Science,Andrew Paul,-0.0980392156862745,448826770,1,https://www.popsci.com/uploads/2024/03/22/fukushima-2011.jpg?auto=webp,eng-9406571

But the winnings you'd take home could vary by as much as $106 million depending on where you bought your ticket, due to state taxes.

Federal taxes are the same for everyone. Winnings are taxed 24% upfront, although the total tax bill will almost certainly be 37% when you actually file, since you'll likely be in the highest tax bracket.

In contrast, taxes on lottery winnings vary widely between U.S. states. They typically range from 3% to 6%, but go up to 10.9% in New York -- the most charged by any state participating in the lottery.

However, eight states don't levy taxes on lottery winnings at all:

If you live in any of these states, you will take home the highest payout possible. That means either $294,251,812 as a cash lump sum or a 30-year annuity totaling $616,764,360, according to usamega.com.

The lump sum payout in these states is $50.2 million more in than in New York, the most-taxed state.

Where you buy the ticket matters, too, as a winning ticket bought outside your home state could trigger taxes for the state in which the ticket was purchased. Generally speaking, your home state will require you to report out-of-state winnings, but will offer a credit or deduction for taxes already paid to a non-resident state.

That means if you live in California, but purchase a winning ticket in Oregon -- which has state tax of 8% on jackpot winnings -- your take-home amount would be worth about $46 million less than if you had purchased the ticket at home in California, which doesn't charge state taxes on jackpots.

If you do happen to win the jackpot, consider hiring a tax professional. They can help you navigate the tax implications, including the best choice of payout and whether you owe out-of-state taxes.

Revenues from the city tax on TVs, appliances, cars and other consumer and business purchases totaled $17.2 million in February, a 6.6% increase over the same month a year ago, the report showed. February's collections -- which reflect spending that took place a month earlier -- followed a 4.7% year-over-year drop in January and a 7.1% jump in December.

The city's sales tax generates more than half of the revenue the city uses to finance its general fund budget, which includes spending on basic city services such as parks, roads and public safety. As a result, city officials closely monitor the performance of the tax.

The recent volatility in sales tax collections isn't a surprise and likely reflects economic uncertainty among some consumers, said Tatiana Bailey, an economist and executive director of Data-Driven Economic Strategies, a Colorado Springs nonprofit.

In recent years, COVID-19 pandemic stimulus checks put money in consumers' pockets, which they spent on online purchases, furniture and other items, Bailey said.

""Now what we're finding, and we saw some of this at the end of '23 as well, the consumer is slowing down,"" she said of retail spending.

Also, there are troubling trends when it comes to consumer debt, Bailey said.

Interest rates on credit cards and auto loans are at record highs and delinquency rates are creeping up in those two categories -- approaching 2006 levels, she said.

""That's a bit worrisome,"" Bailey said.

Likewise, credit card companies report that card holder balances aren't declining, which means consumers are only making minimum payments and failing to chip away at what they owe, she said.

As a result, consumer spending is now falling into two categories and contributing to the unevenness in city sales tax revenues, Bailey said.

Consumers who own a home with 3%, long-term mortgages, stable jobs and stock portfolios continue to spend, while those with high credit card and debt loads are holding back on purchases, she said.

""That's why I think you're seeing not that sort of consistent maybe 2% increase or 1% increase month over month (in city sales tax collections) when things were much more steady,"" Bailey said. ""We're seeing a lot more volatility now.""

Several retail industry categories tracked by the city showed increases in sales tax collections in February, the Finance Department report shows.

Among those categories, business services -- which includes professionals and consultants -- saw a 49.3% year-over-year revenue increase in February. That's a positive sign, Bailey said, because it means consumers and employers are relying on the expertise of those business professionals.

Other retail categories with increases during February included auto repair and leases, which had a 19% gain.

That's a possible indicator that consumers who can't afford cars because of high interest rates are holding onto vehicles longer and paying to have them fixed, Bailey said. Conversely, revenues from auto dealers fell 2.6% in February.

The move Friday is certain to put more pressure on her party, Spain's main conservative opposition Popular Party, to take action against her.

Ayuso, who is seen as a possible future party leader and prime ministerial candidate, has come under fire in recent months on several fronts. Last week, news reports said the Spanish tax office was investigating accusations of tax fraud against her partner, Alberto González Amador.

His alleged enrichment thanks to his connections with Ayuso has led opposition parties to call for her immediate resignation.

Ayuso, who is visiting Chile on Friday, has hit back, denying the allegations and saying they were part of an orchestrated opposition campaign to try to halt her political rise and take the focus off a major scandal affecting the ruling Socialist party.

Ayuso also claims that while she lives in her partner's luxury Madrid apartment, his financial dealings have nothing to do with her.

The court move Friday against González Amador and four other partners was sparked by a prosecutor's probe into tax fraud of some 350,000 euros ($380,000) following treasury inspections.

Lawyers for González admitted to the fraud this week in a statement to the prosecutors' office, Spanish media reported.

Several hundred people gathered outside the Popular Party's headquarters in Madrid on Wednesday to demand Ayuso's dismissal, the first demonstration against her. The party has so far defended her.

The Socialists and the Popular Party are constantly engaged in accusing each other of corruption and not acting against culprits.

The Socialists are currently grappling with the fallout of a probe into money made from the purchase of masks during the Covid-19 crisis that is affecting an adviser of a former minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and strongman in the Socialist party.

Ayuso, 45, has been regional president since 2019 and won an overwhelming majority in regional elections last year.

Dubbed by some as Spain's future Margaret Thatcher, she has rarely been far from controversy, both within her party and outside.

She has come under intense criticism for the deaths of more than 7,000 people in nursing homes during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic as orders were issued that they should not be transferred for treatment to overloaded hospitals in the region.

During the crisis, she also attracted much attention at home and abroad by challenging the national government´s lockdown policies.

This week, she defended her chief adviser against accusations that he had bullied journalists deemed to be from opposition media that have been covering the story about her life partner.",english.elpais.com,news,EL PAÍS,Associated Press,-0.1215686274509804,448826571,1,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/03L4bsUu39AYAI2xW4VVvXNwMvE=/1200x0/filters:focal(1529x579:1539x589)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/KWLYNOYRQJC6DFMMMFRVYDLRXM.jpg,

""I used to get a happy birthday text from my mum every year ... and now I've gone public, they've been told not to have anything to do with me at all,"" he said.

The purpose of the PBCC's ""ecosystem"", as stated in internal documents sighted by this masthead, is to ""maintain the Community's lifecycle"", but particularly to provide funding for the Brethren's schools which are reserved for the church's students.

Ordinary Brethren individuals and businesses are strongly encouraged to spend their money with companies run by the church leaders, such as consulting firm Universal Business Team (UBT).

Documents produced for a recent ""Strive"" forum to advertise these projects to the PBCC's flock say UBT turns over up to $500 million a year. The profits, according to the documents, are ""invested in"" 124 Plymouth Brethren schools and other charities such as public-facing charity the Rapid Relief Team.

But one insider, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said the commercial enterprises appeared to make considerably more money than was distributed to the charities.

""I think the Tax Office will be looking at where all the money actually goes.""

The insider said UBT charges Brethren businesses between $30,000 and $150,000 for two hours of consulting, but most of the consultants are working for free ""thinking they're doing it for the testimony of Bruce Hales"", meaning the gross profits of the business were about 80 per cent.

In the recent ""Strive"" forum the ecosystem's purpose was said to be ""striving towards securing our financial future so we can fund our way of life, indefinitely"". UBT, whose offices were raided, is described in the documents as ""our parent company"".

""Our leadership team comprises members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and professionals from the wider community,"" the documents say.

It is also the central company from which members rent phones and computers. These are fitted with Brethren approved software, including a program called Streamline 3 which means UBT administrators can monitor the browsing history and GPS location of Brethren members and remotely capture images of their screen.

One of the charities funded by the ecosystem, the Rapid Relief Team (RRT), is described by Woodbury as an attempt to rehabilitate the Brethren's poor global reputation, and to help its lobbying of politicians.

In a recent Brethren conference, Strive 23, one of the Rapid Relief Team's aims for the year was that: ""Every locality to engage with a person of influence or status at a local level"".

Woodbury, a former Rapid Relief Team volunteer, said it seemed to be a ""cleverly co-ordinated PR instrument"" of the church.

Other charities are set up, some with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of funds, with the ability to give loans for housing, to fund Brethren travel for religious meetings, and to help the Brethren poor. Though many are constituted to help the ""general community in Australia"", the only beneficiaries are members of their own church.

The Brethren are also establishing their own supermarkets, Campus and Co. Many stores are based on the school grounds and they are staffed by unpaid Brethren women and charge a premium to the flock for their groceries. Brethren members are expected to make a certain percentage of their weekly purchases through Campus and Co.

It is dangerous for PBCC members to question their leaders on these matters, or to fail to comply with orders, because the punishment for questioning the Man of God can include being ""withdrawn from"" - excommunicated.

Bruce Hales, who has led the church since his father died in 2003, has become increasingly wealthy in recent years, as have his sons.

In 2022, this masthead reported that Gareth Hales bought a two-hectare, $9.5 million house in the NSW holiday destination of Dural, set behind a gated entry with a tennis court, heated swimming pool and a golf driving range.

A few months earlier, Nerolie Hales, the wife of Dean, spent $7.5 million buying a 4116 square metre home in Epping, in Sydney's north-western suburbs. And another senior Brethren man, Gavin Grace, of Ballarat, broke the Dural house price record, paying $14 million for a resort-style mansion, which he bought without a mortgage.

The New Daily reported last year that Gareth and Charles Hales were suppliers for more than $1 billion worth of contracts for COVID-19 personal protective equipment in the UK via Unispace Global Limited, and Dean Hales was linked to a network of companies that won more than $30 million in government contracts to supply COVID tests to Australian governments.
